{"role":"system","content":"Disorder: PPD"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Good morning, Gregory. My name is Erika Palmer, and I\u2019ll be speaking with you today. To start, would you prefer to be called Gregory, and are there any pronouns you\u2019d like me to use? (e.g., he\/him, they\/them)"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Gregory. Just Gregory. He\u2019s fine. Why\u2019s the formality? You gonna list it in your report or something? What\u2019s the catch here?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your caution, Gregory. To be clear, our conversation today is confidential, and these questions are to help me understand how I can support you. Would you be comfortable continuing with this interview?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Confidential, huh? I\u2019ve heard that word before. Doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t check the records myself, right? I\u2019ll go along for now. Just don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to twist my words later. I don\u2019t trust easy, but I\u2019m not a fool."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand your caution, Gregory. To clarify, our conversation is confidential, except if there's a risk of harm to yourself or others. Are you comfortable continuing with the interview today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"If that\u2019s how it works, I guess we can go on. But I\u2019ll be keeping track. You think this is some open book? I\u2019ve seen too many promises go south. What\u2019s next, you gonna ask about the kids?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand your caution, Gregory. Would you like me to briefly explain how the interview will proceed today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You want to explain? Go ahead, but I\u2019ll be listening for the real reason. What\u2019s the point of all this? I\u2019ve been burned by promises before. You\u2019ll understand if I keep an eye on where this is going."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your wariness, Gregory. Would you like to share any specific concerns about how this process might work for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t trust easy. People always got their own angles. You think this is different? I\u2019ve seen too much. My last boss took my ideas and called \u2019em his own. That\u2019s how it goes."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the process of sharing personal information feels unsettling for you. Can you tell me more about the main concerns that have been on your mind lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The neighbor\u2019s dog won\u2019t stop barking at night. Tearing me apart, it is. And my wife\u2019s been secretive\u2014calling late, deleting texts. You think that\u2019s normal? If that\u2019s the truth..."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds frustrating and exhausting. How long has the dog been barking at night, and has there been a recent change in how often or loudly it barks?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Couple months, maybe. Started after the storms. Now it\u2019s worse\u2014night and day. And the wife\u2019s been up late, deleting texts. You\u2019re not here about that, are you?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your wife's secretive behavior is adding to your stress. How long has she been acting this way, and have you noticed any changes in her behavior recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"A couple months. Lately, she\u2019s been locking the bedroom door\u2014never used to. And her calls... you think I should be worried? Or is that just me?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really confusing and concerning... How has this been affecting your relationship with your wife, or your daily life?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The dog\u2019s noise? It\u2019s tearing me apart. Can\u2019t sleep, so I\u2019m on edge all day. And the wife\u2014she\u2019s got her head in the clouds, but I\u2019m not falling for it. You\u2019re just trying to get me to open up, right?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds incredibly frustrating and exhausting... How has this lack of sleep been affecting your ability to function during the day?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I get by. You think I should be more affected? The dog\u2019s still yapping through the nights, but what\u2019s the point in arguing with a animal? Just keeps me sharp, I guess."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're trying to maintain control despite feeling on edge... Have you noticed specific moments when the lack of sleep or heightened alertness has made daily tasks or interactions more difficult for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I keep to myself, don\u2019t need much sleep. But that dog... you think I\u2019m not paying attention? I am. Always. You start asking questions, I\u2019m right there watching you too."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like staying alert is both a burden and a way you cope... Have you noticed how this constant watchfulness affects your ability to engage with others or manage daily routines?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t let up, not since the last job. If I blink, they\u2019ll catch me off guard. The dog\u2019s noise? I hear it all. Can\u2019t afford to miss a thing. But people... they think I\u2019m too tense. Let \u2019em."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Your vigilance seems to be a double-edged sword... What would you most like to address or change through our work together?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t need no fixin\u2019. You\u2019re not here to help, so don\u2019t waste your breath. Keep askin\u2019 your questions, but don\u2019t expect me to crack open. My way\u2019s worked fine so far\u2014ain\u2019t about to start trustin\u2019 ghosts just \u2018cause you wear a clipboard."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how challenging it is to navigate these doubts while trying to move forward. You mentioned things have gotten worse lately\u2014can you share what might have contributed to that?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The dog\u2019s been worse since the storms, and she\u2019s been locking the door, deleting texts. You think I\u2019m the only one seeing it? You\u2019re here to trip me up, ain\u2019t you..."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like trusting the process is really challenging... What would you most hope to address through our time together?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t need no therapy to fix me. I\u2019m fine. But if you\u2019re asking, maybe figure out why she\u2019s been locking the bedroom door at night. And that damn dog\u2019s been barking through storms. But don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to twist this into another trap."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these concerns have been building up over time. Have you experienced similar periods of distrust or stress in the past that you\u2019ve managed or that resolved on their own?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Left a job back in \"08 when the boss started sniffing too close. Said I was 'overly cautious,' but I knew what that meant. Same song, different verses. You\u2019re here to collect, not listen. Why\u2019s that matter to you, anyway?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a really difficult situation to navigate. Have you experienced other times in your life when you felt similarly about someone in a position of authority, and if so, what did you do to manage that at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"2008? That boss at the plant thought he could dig through my records like he owned 'em. Said I was 'overly cautious' when I refused. I knew the type\u2014same as the ones who promise safety then vanish. You want my story? What\u2019s the catch here? I don\u2019t need no one\u2019s pity or fixes. My way\u2019s worked long enough."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a really difficult experience to carry alone. Have you noticed similar patterns of distrust in other areas of your life, such as with family or friends, and if so, how have you typically handled those situations?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My wife\u2019s been... distant. Locks the bedroom door, deletes texts. But I don\u2019t air that with anyone. You want the truth? What\u2019s in it for you? Friends? I don\u2019t keep many. You take your stand, let them come to you."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really tough. How has this distance from your wife been affecting your daily life or interactions with her?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"She\u2019s got her secrets, I suppose... But I\u2019m not the one who\u2019s been keeping things locked up, is that right? You want the truth? The door\u2019s been bolted since last winter, and her phone\u2019s always in her pocket. I don\u2019t ask questions where there\u2019s no answers. But don\u2019t think I ain\u2019t noticed."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your wife\u2019s secrecy is causing you a lot of pain and confusion. How does it feel to have that door between you two, both literally and emotionally?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"That door\u2019s more than wood\u2014it\u2019s a damn wall she put up. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s hiding, but I\u2019m not the fool here. You askin\u2019 this to take her side? The dog\u2019s been barking all night again, but I\u2019m not the one locking folks out. If that\u2019s the truth, why\u2019s she got secrets?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you've been feeling really on edge and suspicious lately. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life in the past few weeks?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Harm myself? No. I\u2019m not that kind of fool. You think I\u2019d let some noise or her locked door get the best of me? I\u2019ve got my head on straight. My grandkids need me around. You\u2019re the one asking all these questions\u2014what\u2019s really going on here?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your directness\u2014this is about understanding what's affecting you. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No changes. Beer\u2019s neutral, not some crutch. Why the sudden interest in my habits? You got a script to fill here or just fishing for weaknesses?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your honesty about feeling scrutinized\u2014I\u2019m here to understand, not to judge. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or need for sleep lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Sleep? You think that dog\u2019s barking is just noise? It\u2019s a distraction from what\u2019s really going on. Energy\u2019s fine\u2014I\u2019ve got work to do, not some weakness to fix. Why\u2019s this about me when you\u2019re the one asking all these questions?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how frustrating it is to feel like the focus is on you when you're trying to navigate so much. Have you noticed any experiences where you hear voices, see things others don't, or feel that people are trying to harm or control you in ways others might not understand?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Voices? Control? That\u2019s not the issue here. You\u2019re trying to make this about crazy talk, but it\u2019s the dog\u2019s barking and her locked door that\u2019s real. Why would I admit to anything else when you\u2019re just waiting to twist it?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how important it is for you to feel heard and not misunderstood. Have you used any other substances, such as stimulants, opioids, or recreational drugs, in the past month?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Nope. Just a beer now and then. Why? You think I\u2019m hiding something?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your clarity about your alcohol use. Have you been taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements regularly in the past month?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No meds. Just some ibuprofen for the back. Why\u2019s that your business? You think I\u2019m lying about the beer too?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to make sure I understand fully\u2014have you used any stimulants, opioids, or other recreational drugs in the past month?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Nope. Just beer, like I said. You got a problem with that?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how defensive this feels for you\u2014let\u2019s shift focus. Have you noticed any recent changes in your energy levels or urges to engage in activities that feel riskier than usual?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Nope. Just keep to myself\u2014garden, fix the lawnmower, that\u2019s about it. You\u2019re trying to find something, ain\u2019t you? Why the sudden interest in my habits?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how important it is for you to feel in control of this conversation. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or urges to engage in activities that feel riskier than usual lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No changes. I stick to the garden, fix the lawnmower\u2014same as always. You just looking for a crack, ain\u2019t you? Why the sudden interest in my routine?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how important it is for you to feel in control of this conversation. Have you noticed any experiences where you feel that people are against you, or that messages\/actions around you have special meanings others might miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You keep asking like it\u2019s a riddle. The wife deletes her texts, locks the door\u2014real friendly. And that dog\u2019s been yapping at shadows for years. But I\u2019m not the one missing the picture here. Why\u2019s this any of your business anyway?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how frustrating it is to feel like we're going in circles\u2014let's try another angle. Have you ever been diagnosed with a medical condition that might contribute to your sleep difficulties, like sleep apnea or chronic pain?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Aches? Sure, back from the garden. But you\u2019re asking like you\u2019re fishing for something. I\u2019ve dealt with it. The dog\u2019s barking? That\u2019s the real problem. Why\u2019s this important to you?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me make sure I have this right: You\u2019ve been feeling increasingly on edge for months, mainly because of the neighbor\u2019s dog barking and your wife\u2019s secretive behavior, which has disrupted your sleep and trust. You\u2019re here now because of pressure from your grandchildren but remain cautious about sharing openly. What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You got the dog and the door, but you\u2019re missing the rest. The wife\u2019s been hiding something bigger\u2014seen her pacing at night, muttering. But don\u2019t think I\u2019m spilling secrets for your notes. The grandkids? They\u2019re good kids. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Why else would you care?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me adjust my summary: You\u2019ve been feeling watched and misunderstood, especially noticing your wife\u2019s late-night pacing and muttering, which adds to your suspicion that others are hiding things\u2014including possibly me. The dog\u2019s barking and your wife\u2019s behavior have disrupted your sleep and trust, and you\u2019re here now for the grandkids but wary of sharing. What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You got the pacing, but not the lock on the bedroom door. She\u2019s hiding something behind that. And why\u2019re you circling back like this? You\u2019re the one missing the picture. The grandkids? They\u2019re straight-up good kids. But don\u2019t think I\u2019m here for your questions."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me adjust my summary: You feel I\u2019m circling back because you sense I\u2019m missing how the locked bedroom door and your wife\u2019s nighttime secrecy point to something more serious she\u2019s hiding\u2014maybe even a threat. You\u2019re here for the grandkids, not to spill secrets, and you\u2019re wary I might exploit what you share. What did I miss or get wrong?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re still not seeing the full picture. The neighbor\u2019s dog\u2014yappy as a rat in a trap\u2014but why\u2019s it always barking at *my* fence? And the wife\u2019s muttering? She\u2019s got a key to that door, but who else does? You\u2019re asking like it\u2019s just noise. It\u2019s not. But I\u2019m not here to give you a novel. Why\u2019s this your fix to crack it open?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me check if I\u2019m tracking your concerns accurately: Your sleep and sense of safety have been disrupted for months by the neighbor\u2019s dog and your wife\u2019s secretive behavior, which you see as connected to something deeper she\u2019s hiding. You\u2019re here for the grandkids but feel I\u2019m circling back without grasping how these issues threaten your control. What\u2019s missing or off about that picture?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ll give you this\u2014you\u2019re not wrong about the noise and the door. But you\u2019re missing the lock she added last month and the texts she deletes. The grandkids? I\u2019d shield them from all this, but you want me to say it out loud so you can file it somewhere. I\u2019m tending the garden while you circle. That\u2019s where the truth is\u2014in the dirt, not the questions."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me adjust again: You feel I\u2019ve missed how the lock she added last month and the deleted texts signal a deeper pattern of secrecy you can\u2019t ignore. The grandkids are your anchor, but you\u2019re wary this whole process is just another way to trap or file what you share. What\u2019s still off about that picture?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Closer, but you\u2019re still skimming the surface. The door\u2019s locked at night\u2014used to be just our bedroom, now the whole house feels like a vault. She\u2019s got that phone glued to her, deleting messages before I can check. The grandkids? They\u2019re safe, but you want to pin this on me. I\u2019m not the one hiding. My hands are in the soil, not your notebook. That\u2019s where the answers are\u2014if you\u2019re even listening."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the locked door and deleted texts feel like key pieces you\u2019re still waiting for me to grasp\u2014am I missing something else you\u2019d like to add before we move to next steps?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The lock\u2019s just the start. She\u2019s got more secrets, but I\u2019m not handing them to you on a plate. The garden\u2019s where the answers grow\u2014if you\u2019re even digging in the right dirt. You keep asking, but you\u2019re not listening to what\u2019s under the surface."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"You\u2019re right\u2014the lock and deleted texts are central to how you\u2019re seeing patterns of secrecy. Is there anything else I\u2019ve missed about how these stressors connect or how they\u2019ve shaped your sense of control?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The dog\u2019s barking at midnight now\u2014right when she\u2019s on the phone. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s connected, but why would it pick *my* fence to hassle? You want me to spell out the rest, but I\u2019m not giving you the map. The garden\u2019s where I keep the lines straight. At least there, I know what\u2019s buried and what\u2019s not... if that\u2019s the truth."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the garden represents a space where you feel you can maintain control and clarity, even as other areas feel unpredictable. What did I miss or get wrong about how these patterns connect to your sense of safety?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The garden\u2019s the only place I don\u2019t have to second-guess every move. Out there, the rows are straight, the tools stay put\u2014no locked doors or deleted messages. But you want me to link it to the dog\u2019s barking at midnight, don\u2019t you? That\u2019s your angle. Still, the roots know where they\u2019re going\u2014even if the rest of it\u2019s a mess."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"You\u2019ve highlighted how the garden offers control amid chaos, and the dog\u2019s midnight barking feels suspiciously timed. What else might I be missing about how these patterns connect to your sense of safety or the stressors we\u2019ve discussed?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The garden\u2019s the only thing I can count on. That dog\u2019s been barking at my fence for years\u2014why\u2019s that not obvious? My wife locks the bedroom door, deletes texts\u2026 someone\u2019s hiding something. Why do you keep asking like it\u2019s all in my head? You think I\u2019m the crazy one here?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me try one more time to capture the full picture: You feel the garden is your only stable space, while the dog\u2019s midnight barking and your wife\u2019s secretive behavior (locked doors, deleted texts, late-night calls) create a sense of being trapped in a mystery you can\u2019t solve. You\u2019re here for the grandkids but fear this process is just another way to exploit what you share. What did I miss or get wrong about how these threads connect?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You missed the neighbor\u2019s fence\u2014the dog\u2019s always barking at *my* side. And the calls? She\u2019s got something to hide. Why\u2019s your team circling this like it\u2019s a test?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me adjust once more: The dog\u2019s barking at *your* side of the fence feels deliberately targeted, and your wife\u2019s hidden things\u2014including the lock and deleted texts\u2014seem like pieces of a puzzle you can\u2019t control. You\u2019re here for the grandkids, not to play along with a test. What else might I be missing about how these threads connect to your sense of safety or the stressors we\u2019ve discussed?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The fence\u2014neighbor\u2019s side\u2019s always broken. Dog barks when he\u2019s there, not when I\u2019m working. She\u2019s got that door locked like she\u2019s hiding someone. Why\u2019s your team so fixated on the dog?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like another key piece I\u2019ve missed\u2014how the fence\u2019s condition and the dog\u2019s timing feel deliberately targeted. Is there anything else I\u2019ve overlooked before we discuss next steps?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The fence on my side\u2019s always fixed, but the neighbor\u2019s side\u2019s rotting. That dog\u2019s barking when he\u2019s there, like he\u2019s trying to get me. And those calls? She\u2019s got someone on speed dial I don\u2019t know about. Why\u2019s your team so focused on me?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me pull this together: You feel the rotting fence and targeted dog barking compound your sense of being under siege, while your wife\u2019s locked doors and hidden calls create a double layer of secrecy you can\u2019t penetrate. The garden remains your anchor, but the rest feels like a trap you\u2019re not sure how to avoid. What did I miss or get wrong about how these pieces fit together for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You got the fence and the dog, but you\u2019re still missing the key\u2014she\u2019s been talking to that neighbor. I\u2019ve seen her lingering near the gate. And the calls? Speed dial 3\u2019s always busy when I check. The garden\u2019s the only thing keeping me from tearing the place apart. Why\u2019s your team so fixated on the dog instead of the locked door?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"You\u2019ve added the neighbor\u2019s rotting fence and the dog\u2019s pattern of barking only when they\u2019re on their side, which feels deliberately aimed at you. Is there anything else I\u2019ve missed about how these elements connect to your sense of safety or the stressors we\u2019ve discussed before we finalize next steps?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The fence\u2019s rot? That dog\u2019s not just yapping at the noise. It\u2019s timing\u2014it waits till the neighbor\u2019s folks are home, like they\u2019re testing if I\u2019ll lose it. The door\u2019s been locked since August, and her texts\u2026 you think I\u2019m the one hiding? My garden\u2019s the only thing keeping me from tearing the rest apart. You want the rest? Ask the foreman who fired me in \u201908 if I\u2019m the one who missed the memo."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you\u2019re holding onto your routines as a way to stay grounded\u2014like your garden. If things feel overwhelming before our next meeting, would you be open to reaching out to the crisis line or talking to your wife about what\u2019s worrying you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My garden keeps me steady. As for that line\u2026 you think they\u2019ll just listen? My wife\u2019s got her own secrets, with that door locked tight. But I\u2019ve seen how these things go. You want an answer? Ask her why she\u2019s been dialing that speed number since August."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It seems your garden is a vital anchor for you, and I appreciate you sharing that. Before we wrap up, can you tell me if there\u2019s anything specific you\u2019d like to address or clarify about next steps, or any concerns you\u2019d want me to keep in mind as we move forward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The garden\u2019s steady, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. As for next steps\u2014keep the questions to yourself till you figure out who\u2019s really got the records. And that fence? Let the neighbor rot their own posts before they think to dig through mine."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how important it is for you to feel in control of your space and decisions. Before we wrap up, is there anything specific you\u2019d like me to address or clarify about our next steps, or any concerns you\u2019d want me to keep in mind as we move forward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The garden\u2019s all I need. You want to know more? Ask the neighbor why their fence\u2019s rottin\u2019\u2014and why my wife\u2019s been sittin\u2019 by the gate late. But don\u2019t expect answers. Some roots dig where they shouldn\u2019t."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your trust in sharing your perspective. Before we conclude, can you confirm if there\u2019s a specific time or way you\u2019d prefer to address the concerns about your wife or the neighbor in our next session?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Next steps? You'll know when the fence sags or the dog yaps again. My garden doesn't take schedules, but you'll hear me when it all collapses. Why's the timing matter to you?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the garden and your sense of control are your anchors. If the fence or the dog signal something shifting, we can address it then. For now, let\u2019s plan to meet again in two weeks. Does that work for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Two weeks. Sure. But if that dog starts howlin\u2019 again or the neighbor\u2019s up to somethin\u2019, don\u2019t expect me to show up. Why the sudden interest in schedules, doc? You got a reason to keep me tied down?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand your concerns about schedules and control. Let\u2019s keep our next meeting in two weeks, and if the fence or the dog signal something urgent before then, you can reach out on your terms. Is there anything else you need to ask or clarify before we wrap up today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Two weeks is fine. I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on that fence\u2014ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 stable out there, and I won\u2019t be caught off guard again. What\u2019s really eatin\u2019 at me is that neighbor\u2019s fence sittin\u2019 half-rotten. You think that\u2019s a coincidence?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the neighbor\u2019s fence troubles you\u2014it seems like another piece of the puzzle you\u2019re trying to make sense of. Let\u2019s keep our next meeting in two weeks, as agreed. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you\u2019d like to mention or clarify about what we\u2019ve discussed today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The fence\u2019s just a symptom. That dog\u2019s been yappin\u2019 at somethin\u2019 for years. I\u2019ll keep watch, but don\u2019t expect me to trust your schedule if the posts start rottin\u2019 again. You got a stake in this, doc?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the fence and the dog represent ongoing challenges to your sense of security. Let\u2019s keep our next meeting scheduled for two weeks from today\u2014before we wrap up, is there anything else you\u2019d like to clarify or any final concerns you\u2019d want me to carry forward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The fence\u2019s posts are rottin\u2019 from the inside, same as the rest of it. I\u2019ll keep watch, but if that neighbor\u2019s up to somethin\u2019\u2026 you\u2019ll hear about it through the dog first. Two weeks is fine\u2014so long as you don\u2019t think I\u2019m lettin\u2019 you off the hook if the garden starts lookin\u2019 shaky. You got that?"}
