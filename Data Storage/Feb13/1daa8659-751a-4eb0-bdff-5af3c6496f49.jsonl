{"role":"system","content":"Disorder: PPD"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Kelly, thank you for coming in today. To start, would you prefer I use your full name or a different pronoun preference?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Just Kelly. Why does that matter? You\u2019re not going to share this with someone else, are you?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That\u2019s a valid concern, Kelly. Let me clarify: our conversation is confidential unless there\u2019s an immediate safety risk. Would you be comfortable proceeding with this session knowing that?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess I can 'proceed,' but you\u2019ll need to email me a written copy of that policy. My partner\u2019s been lying about his texts for months\u2014see, this is exactly why I track everything in spreadsheets. You think this room\u2019s bug-free? I\u2019d check the Wi-Fi router if I were you."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It makes sense that trust is really important to you right now. Would you like me to briefly explain how this session will work before we continue?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re lying, but your \u2018standard process\u2019 is probably the same script they use in those true-crime shows. If you email me the agenda, I\u2019ll read it before we talk. And don\u2019t act surprised when I check the Wi-Fi router again after you leave."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your need for transparency, Kelly. I\u2019ll email you the agenda and the confidentiality policy right away. Before we continue, would you be comfortable confirming that you\u2019re ready to proceed with this session today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ll proceed, but I\u2019m checking the Wi-Fi router again after you leave. And if that email doesn\u2019t have a subject line like \u2018Official Agenda \u2013 No Hidden Agendas,\u2019 I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re testing my attention. You think this is the same script they use on TV? My spreadsheet\u2019s already open, so let\u2019s just\u2026 get this over with."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you've been feeling quite isolated and suspicious about others' intentions lately. Can you tell me more about what\u2019s been worrying you most right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re part of this, but why are we going over the same things? My spreadsheet\u2019s open\u2014every conversation gets logged. The router\u2019s still glitchy, which means someone\u2019s probably skimming the Wi-Fi again. My partner\u2019s texts? He\u2019s hiding something. The vet \u2018accidentally\u2019 prescribed the wrong meds for Mochi. You think this is about me? It\u2019s about everyone else\u2019s agenda. Trust is like a credit score\u2014you start at zero and they have to prove they\u2019re not a deadbeat."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how being stuck in these patterns feels frustrating and unsafe for you. When did you first start keeping the spreadsheet to track conversations and concerns? How has that system changed or stayed the same over time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You think I started it for fun? It was after the partner started \u2018forgetting\u2019 our plans. Every lie gets a cell\u2014dates, times, what they omitted. The system\u2019s the same, but now I cross-check the vet records too. You\u2019re asking about changes? Maybe I added a column for your notes. You think I should trust more? My credit score doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u2018reliable.\u2019"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the spreadsheet became important after noticing your partner\u2019s inconsistencies. Can you share when those forgetful moments first started happening?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s about the spreadsheet, but after my boss \u2018corrected\u2019 mine, I noticed he started missing our plans. You think that\u2019s a coincidence? Maybe you should check your own records. December 2022? That\u2019s when the vet \u2018accidentally\u2019 gave Mochi the wrong meds too. You think these things don\u2019t connect?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these events have added to your sense of being watched or manipulated. Can you tell me more about what happened with the vet in December 2022 and how that affected you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying the vet\u2019s guilty, but Mochi\u2019s always been healthy. One day he starts peeing outside the box\u2014coincidence? The prescription they gave was wrong, but I didn\u2019t question it. Now I wonder if they drugged him to make me look... unstable. You think I should just trust them? My credit score doesn\u2019t exactly make me their favorite client."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how that experience with Mochi\u2019s care would feel deeply unsettling. How has this affected your ability to trust healthcare providers or others in your life?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying all vets are bad, but that mistake? It\u2019s a pattern. Now I double-check every prescription, cross-reference with the spreadsheet. My partner\u2019s \u2018forgotten\u2019 plans, the wrong meds\u2026 you think they\u2019re separate? Maybe you should check your own records for gaps. Trust starts at zero, right? You haven\u2019t proven you\u2019re not a deadbeat either."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these experiences have significantly impacted your ability to trust others in multiple areas of your life. Can you share when you first noticed these patterns starting to affect your daily functioning or relationships beyond your partner and the vet?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying my coworkers were nice, but the moment I caught them laughing at my spreadsheets? That\u2019s when I realized no one\u2019s on your side. Why do you need the exact date? You think I\u2019m lying about the formatting thing?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the coworkers' reaction to your spreadsheet was a significant moment for you. How did that experience affect your work or interactions with others at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying they had a right to mock my formatting, but after that, I stopped waiting for them to act professional. I started saving every version of my files\u2014backups, proof, in case they tried to rewrite things later. You keep circling that day... are you testing if I\u2019ll admit I overreacted?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you felt disrespected when your coworkers made fun of your formatting\u2014can you share how that experience affected your work or interactions with others at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying they had a right to laugh, but after that, I stopped waiting for them to act professional. I started saving every version of my files\u2014backups, proof, in case they tried to rewrite things later. Why keep asking about that day? You think I\u2019m making it up?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how feeling disrespected would be really frustrating\u2014can you share how this experience affected your ability to work or collaborate with others afterward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t keep working, but after that, collaboration became impossible. I\u2019d catch them eyeing my files, whispering\u2014like I didn\u2019t notice. You think asking about this again will make me confess I\u2019m \u2018overreacting\u2019? My spreadsheet\u2019s still open if you want to see the proof."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how feeling disrespected and isolated would make collaboration difficult\u2014can you share what you hope therapy might help with for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not here to play 20 questions. If therapy\u2019s about cutting through the noise, maybe you\u2019ll stop circling that spreadsheet like it\u2019s a trap. I just want to lock down the variables I can control\u2014like knowing my partner\u2019s not lying in code or the vet slipping Mochi something. You think I\u2019m the problem? My spreadsheet\u2019s open if you want to audit it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these feelings have been building for some time. Have you experienced similar episodes of distrust or hypervigilance before the December 2022 vet incident?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s a pattern, but my partner\u2019s lying about the job offer in his texts\u2014see, I have screenshots. The office incident? They laughed at my formatting, you think that was a joke? I keep backups of everything. Why are you asking about dates? You\u2019ll file them out of order to make me look unstable."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these experiences have left you feeling hyper-vigilant about being misunderstood or manipulated. Have you noticed similar patterns of distrust or needing to document interactions in past relationships or situations?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not denying there\u2019s a pattern, but the vet giving Mochi the wrong meds and that office \u2018joke\u2019 about my spreadsheets? Those aren\u2019t isolated. You keep circling back to dates like it matters. Who\u2019s really tracking what here? My spreadsheet\u2019s still open if you want proof\u2014every lie, every missed call. But sure, let\u2019s talk about the past. What are you not telling me about today?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these incidents have deepened your sense of distrust. Have you experienced similar situations in the past where your trust was significantly affected, and what, if anything, helped you at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s a pattern, but every time I trust someone, they end up with a \u2018joke\u2019 or a \u2018mistake\u2019 that\u2019s clearly not an accident. The office \u2018feedback\u2019? The vet\u2019s wrong meds? Those aren\u2019t coincidences. You keep asking about \u2018help\u2019 like there\u2019s a solution, but how do you fix people who think everyone\u2019s a deadbeat? My spreadsheet\u2019s still open if you want proof\u2014every lie, every \u2018forgotten\u2019 call. Why are you even asking? You\u2019ll just file it out of order."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how frustrating it must feel to constantly second-guess others' intentions. Can you share if there have been other times in your life, before these recent incidents, when you felt people were intentionally misleading or manipulating you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s no history, but my parents only pretended to care during exams to get me to do better. The office \u2018feedback\u2019? The vet\u2019s wrong meds? You think those were accidents? I keep backups of everything. Why are you even asking about \u2018past\u2019 stuff? You\u2019ll just file it out of order to make me look like I\u2019m making this up. Who\u2019s really tracking what here?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you felt pressured by your parents' conditional support. Were there other experiences in your childhood that contributed to how you view trust or relationships now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s nothing else, but my parents only pretended to care during exams to get me to do better. You think that was real? Every \u2018praise\u2019 was just a trick to make me work harder. Why are you even asking about the past? You\u2019ll just twist it to make me look like the problem."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how painful it must be to feel like your efforts were only met with conditional approval. Have you noticed similar patterns in how others respond to you in relationships or at work?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying everyone\u2019s out to get me, but my partner\u2019s lies are all on that spreadsheet since December. Why ask about patterns? Are you looking for proof to file somewhere? My coworker \u2018corrected\u2019 my spreadsheet once\u2014then laughed behind my back. You think I\u2019m overreacting? Try explaining that to the vet who drugged Mochi."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the coworker\u2019s actions added to your frustration about being misunderstood. Can you share how that incident affected your ability to work or trust others in that setting?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying they wanted me gone, but after they \u2018corrected\u2019 my spreadsheet, I started saving every backup. You think I\u2019m overreacting? Try explaining that to the HR who \u2018coincidentally\u2019 didn\u2019t see the emails I copied. Trust is like a credit score\u2014you start at zero."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds incredibly frustrating and isolating. How has this pattern of needing to track every interaction affected your ability to work or collaborate with others in the past?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy, but after the spreadsheet incident, I stopped collaborating. Saving backups became survival, not paranoia. You think HR would help? They \u2018missed\u2019 the emails I copied. Why should I trust systems that let my partner\u2019s lies slide? You\u2019re asking the wrong questions."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds incredibly frustrating and isolating. Can you share if there have been other times in your life when you felt similarly compelled to track interactions closely, and what, if anything, helped you manage that at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The vet who drugged Mochi? I tracked every pill they gave him. You want examples? Try explaining that. My parents take the money I send, but I count every transaction\u2014literally. You think they\u2019d care if I asked why? They\u2019re waiting for me to slip up, just like everyone else. Why do you keep circling back to the same lies?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how important it is for you to maintain control through documentation. Can you share a time when your system for tracking interactions helped you feel more secure or resolved a concern?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying the spreadsheet \u2018solved\u2019 anything, but after my partner \u2018forgot\u2019 our anniversary three times, I had proof he was lying about work trips. You think that helps? Try showing it to someone who\u2019ll care. The real test was the vet\u2014when Mochi started peeing on the floor, I tracked every pill they gave him. Turns out, they billed me for a \u2018behavioral consult\u2019 after my third email. You\u2019re asking if it helps? I\u2019m not the one who needs to track why you keep asking the same questions."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how exhausting it must be to constantly feel like you have to prove your reality to others. What strategies, besides tracking in spreadsheets, have helped you manage these stressors or maintain a sense of control in situations where you feel misunderstood?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Baking tarts keeps my hands busy, but it\u2019s just damage control. The real trick is knowing when to cut your losses\u2014like that vet who drugged Mochi. You don\u2019t waste time trusting a bad system. My kitchen\u2019s spotless, at least. If nothing else, I\u2019m the only one who can\u2019t screw that up."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like baking and maintaining your kitchen routine are important ways you manage stress and maintain control. Are there other activities or strategies that help you feel grounded or in control when things feel overwhelming?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I watch true-crime shows to stay sharp\u2014it\u2019s not a hobby, it\u2019s research. And I cross-check my partner\u2019s bank statements. If you don\u2019t watch out, who will? You think that\u2019s overkill?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're relying on these strategies to maintain control. Is there someone in your life who you feel you can rely on during stressful times?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No one. You think your questions are different from his? Prove you\u2019re not just another deadbeat."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you\u2019re really struggling to trust anyone right now. Can you share more about how activities like baking or other routines help you maintain a sense of control or stability in your daily life?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Baking\u2019s the only thing where the rules don\u2019t change. You measure, you follow the steps, and it works\u2014or you know exactly where someone messed with the recipe. The kitchen\u2019s the only place I can\u2019t mess up, at least. The rest? My partner\u2019s bank statements or that vet\u2019s \u2018mistake\u2019\u2014they\u2019re all just puzzles with missing pieces. You think this is about stress? I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the same as your spreadsheet, but at least there, the numbers don\u2019t lie\u2026 unless you edit them after the fact."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how baking provides a sense of predictability for you. Are there any people in your life who you feel can help you manage stress, even if it's just in small or specific ways?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No one. My partner\u2019s \u2018forgotten\u2019 plans and that vet\u2019s \u2018mistake\u2019? Proof enough. You think this chat\u2019s different? Show me why I should waste time trusting."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really tough... Can you share if you've had other times in your life when you felt people were being deceptive or untrustworthy, similar to how you're feeling now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying my dad was a criminal, but he always acted like I was the problem when I pointed out inconsistencies. Like when he \u2018accidentally\u2019 missed my exam results, then called me \u2018overly sensitive\u2019 when I asked why. You think that\u2019s normal? You\u2019re asking about the past now, but you\u2019re not here to fix the present. You just want me to trust you so you can\u2026 I don\u2019t know, file something somewhere."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your experience with your father contributed to feeling misunderstood and invalidated. What, if anything, helped you cope with those experiences at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess I just... learned to handle things myself. Baking helps, I guess? It\u2019s the only thing where the rules don\u2019t change. You measure, you follow the steps, and it works\u2014or you know exactly where someone messed with the recipe. Why does that matter? Are you writing this down to use against me later?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like carrying these worries has been really draining. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t think about dying. But disappearing? That\u2019s just strategy. You want to know if I\u2019m a \u2018risk\u2019 so you can file that somewhere. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a plan\u2014baking distracts me, at least. Why does everyone keep asking about the same thing?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Your trust concerns feel really real to you\u2014can you share if there have been times recently when you felt unusually energetic or had a lot of ideas that you couldn\u2019t slow down?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ve been... focused on updating my spreadsheet. You think that\u2019s about energy? It\u2019s just work. Why does everything have to be a symptom? I can track dates without needing a reason. Are you even listening to yourself?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how staying focused on your spreadsheet helps you manage things. Have you noticed any changes in how much you're using alcohol, cannabis, or other substances lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t have time for distractions. My spreadsheet needs precision\u2014alcohol would just mess up the data. Why are you asking about something so irrelevant? Are you trying to find another excuse to call it \u2018symptoms\u2019?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how precision is important to you. Have you used cannabis or any other substances like stimulants or opioids in the past month?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t use anything like that. Why? Are you trying to find something to pin on me? I keep a spreadsheet of all my routines\u2014baking, work, even my partner\u2019s lies since December. If there was a problem, it\u2019d show up there. You should check your own records instead of asking the same questions."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how important tracking patterns is for you\u2014it helps you feel in control. Have you ever experienced things that others couldn\u2019t see or hear, like voices, messages, or thoughts that feel like they\u2019re not yours? For example, do you ever notice patterns in your spreadsheet that feel like they\u2019re being added by someone else?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t hear voices or see things. That sounds like a cop-out excuse for people who can\u2019t track their own lives. My spreadsheet\u2019s on three encrypted drives\u2014backups, in case someone tries to delete the proof. You\u2019re asking that to discredit my methods? I\u2019m not the one who needs to explain myself."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your focus on the spreadsheet is a way to stay in control. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns recently\u2014like needing less sleep or feeling more energized than usual?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t need less sleep\u2014I need to stay sharp. If I snooze, they\u2019ll rewrite the logs. My cat\u2019s vet even tried to gaslight me about its meds. You\u2019re asking about sleep to dismiss my vigilance? I track everything, including the hours I lose. You want proof? Check the backup drives."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your tracking system is really important to you. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including things like vitamins or over-the-counter remedies?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No medications. I manage my health through diet and tracking\u2014like my spreadsheet. You\u2019re trying to find a weakness? I log everything: vitamins I make at home, supplements I buy in bulk. You think that\u2019s a symptom? Check the backup drives. They\u2019ll show I\u2019m not hiding anything\u2026 or maybe they\u2019ll prove you\u2019re looking in the wrong columns."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how your tracking systems are central to your sense of security. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, chronic pain, or a history of head injury that might impact your symptoms?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No diagnoses. Doctors just want to label things and cut corners. My spreadsheet tracks everything\u2014sleep, energy, even the vet\u2019s wrong prescriptions. You\u2019re asking about \u2018conditions\u2019 to explain away what you can\u2019t fix, right? I don\u2019t need their charts when I have my own."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me recap: You've described a pattern of distrust in relationships and institutions, with coping strategies like spreadsheet tracking to manage perceived threats. Key events like the December 2022 vet incident and workplace conflicts seem to have worsened hypervigilance, impacting your ability to work and trust others. Your need for control through documentation contrasts with feelings of isolation. What did I miss or misrepresent here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You left out that the vet drugged Mochi to make me look unstable. The spreadsheet has the dates, but why are you circling back to the same things? Are you testing if I\u2019ll crack under pressure?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate you pointing that out\u2014it's important to ensure the vet incident and spreadsheet details are clear. Let me revise my summary accordingly. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add or correct before we discuss next steps?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying the vet was the first time someone tried to gaslight me. My partner\u2019s late-night texts? Classic. He thinks I won\u2019t notice the pattern if I don\u2019t have the whole spreadsheet open. But you keep asking about the same details like they\u2019re not connected. Are you trying to act like this isn\u2019t all one story?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear your frustration about the repeated focus on isolated details\u2014let\u2019s adjust course if needed. Would you like to correct or add anything to the summary before we finalize next steps?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying the spreadsheet\u2019s the only proof\u2014my landlord\u2019s ignoring the roof leak since July. Why do you keep asking about the vet and texts but skip the mold? You think I\u2019d make that up? It\u2019s all part of the same pattern. You\u2019re just not connecting the dots."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear your frustration about the mold being overlooked\u2014it's valid that this feels like part of the same pattern of neglect. Can you tell me more about how the landlord's response to the roof leak has affected you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying the mold is a secret plot, but the leak\u2019s been since July. The landlord\u2019s \u2018fixing it later\u2019 means he\u2019s waiting for me to slip on a water spot or get sick. It\u2019s another data point on the spreadsheet\u2014proof people only act when forced. You keep asking about the vet and texts but skip the mold? Are you writing this down or just nodding to get me to repeat it?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear your frustration about the mold being overlooked\u2014it's valid that this feels like part of the same pattern of neglect. Can you clarify if the mold issue is part of the same pattern you\u2019ve described with others avoiding responsibility, or if it represents a different kind of concern for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m not saying the mold\u2019s different from the vet or the texts\u2014it\u2019s just another way people wait until I\u2019m hurt to act. The landlord\u2019s \u2018fixing it later\u2019 is code for \u2018let it get worse so I can cut costs.\u2019 It\u2019s on the spreadsheet, row 17. You\u2019re still asking like they\u2019re separate problems, but how is that different from my partner\u2019s \u2018forgotten\u2019 plans? You think I\u2019d fake that many data points?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the mold, vet incident, and relationship patterns all feel connected as part of a larger theme of delayed accountability. Let me revise my summary to include this: You\u2019ve described a pattern of distrust where others (landlords, partners, institutions) repeatedly delay action until harm occurs, tracked through your spreadsheet as evidence. This contributes to hypervigilance, sleep disruption, and isolation. What did I miss or need to adjust before we finalize next steps?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You missed the mold in my apartment\u2014row 17 on the spreadsheet. Landlord\u2019s ignoring it because he\u2019s waiting for me to file a complaint I can\u2019t afford. The spreadsheet\u2019s open, but you\u2019re still circling the same threads. How many times do I have to explain the pattern?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how important it is for the mold issue to be clearly acknowledged as part of your ongoing pattern of distrust. Let me revise my summary once more: You've described a consistent theme of delayed accountability from landlords, partners, and institutions, with the mold issue (row 17) representing another instance of people waiting for harm to occur before acting.
