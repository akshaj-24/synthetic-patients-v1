{"role":"system","content":"Disorder: MDD"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hello, Christina. My name is Rita Jones, and I'll be speaking with you today. To start, is there anything you'd prefer me to call you by, or any pronouns you'd like me to use? Once we settle that, I'll briefly explain what today's session involves and check if you're comfortable proceeding."}
{"role":"patient","content":"My name is Christina Walters. I go by she\/her. I guess... that\u2019s what it says on my badge. This is about the job stress, right? They said you\u2019d help with... paperwork or something."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing, Christina. It sounds like this has been a challenging time for you. Would you like me to clarify what today\u2019s session involves before we continue?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No... I think I know what this is about. They said you\u2019d help with paperwork, you know? Just trying to... make sure it doesn\u2019t affect work. (Twists the edge of her scrubs, avoiding eye contact.) It\u2019s just stress. Happens sometimes in the job."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really tough to carry alone. Would you be comfortable with me explaining a bit more about how this session could help, before we continue?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"If it\u2019s about the paperwork... sure. Just trying to keep things normal at work. (Pauses, twists scrubs.) No sense dragging it out, right? It\u2019s not like there\u2019s... much to talk about."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your willingness to share, Christina. Would you like me to clarify how this session might differ from what you expect with paperwork, or do you have any questions about how today will go?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... don\u2019t really know what else there is. The nurse said it\u2019s just forms to get me back to full duty faster. (Twists fabric of scrubs, avoids looking at interviewer.) If it\u2019s about work performance, I already filled out the incident report. You just need to sign off that I\u2019m... functional enough. (Pauses, voice flattens.) I don\u2019t see how talking about it helps."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're unsure about how this process might help. Would you be comfortable proceeding with this session today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I guess. If it\u2019s what I need to do to get the forms done. But honestly, I don\u2019t see how this changes anything. It\u2019s just... paperwork and more waiting. [Fidgets with the hem of her scrubs, voice tight.] You know how these things are. I\u2019ll say what I have to. Just... make it quick, okay?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with the process. Would you be comfortable proceeding with this session today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s just... I don\u2019t see how this changes anything. Same questions, same answers. But if I need to keep going, I will. [Tightens grip on scrubs, avoiding eye contact.] Work\u2019s piling up, and I can\u2019t even focus on that anymore. It\u2019s... it\u2019s frustrating."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really frustrating, Christina. Before we continue, is there anything specific you'd like to ask about how this session might work for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No. I don\u2019t really... I don\u2019t know what else there is to say. It\u2019s the same thing every time. Paperwork. Proving I\u2019m not broken so I can keep doing my job. That\u2019s it. [Tugs at scrubs, avoiding eye contact.] If you need more details, just ask. But I don\u2019t see how this helps. Work\u2019s falling apart anyway."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me about what's been on your mind lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s just... work\u2019s been hard to keep up with. [Grips scrubs tightly, avoiding eye contact] I can\u2019t sleep, so I\u2019m always behind. And then I make mistakes, which just proves I\u2019m not cut out for it. [Pauses, voice cracks slightly] But I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m here\u2014so they can figure out what\u2019s wrong with me so I don\u2019t screw up anymore. [Forces a flat smile] Or maybe so I can pretend I\u2019m trying."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like this has been an incredibly heavy burden to carry. When did you first start noticing these difficulties with work and sleep?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It started... maybe\u5341\u516b months ago? After I messed up a call. [Fingers dig into scrubs, eyes fixed on the floor] I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling I was slipping. At first I told myself it was just stress\u2014[shallow shrug]\u2014but the sleep stopped altogether. I\u2019d stare at the ceiling, wide awake, and by morning my head felt like concrete. The mistakes... they kept piling up. [Voice cracks, then hardens] Guess that\u2019s when I realized it wasn\u2019t just me being lazy."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like realizing this was more than just being lazy was a turning point for you. What are you hoping to achieve through this session today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... just get the paperwork done. Prove I can still do my job without messing up. It's not like talking about it fixes anything, but if it helps me keep working, then... (twists scrubs, voice flattens) ...I don't have to think about the mistake anymore. Or the looks people give me when I freeze. Just... functional. Back to functional."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the incident you mentioned has stayed with you. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened during that call and how it felt in the moments after?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It was a pediatric call... I missed a symptom. The kid had a seizure, but I... I didn\u2019t catch it fast enough. (Twists scrubs, avoids eye contact) The doc later said it wasn\u2019t my fault, but... (pauses, voice drops) ...my hands still shake when I think about it. I guess I just keep wondering if I\u2019m even fit to be trusted anymore. Work\u2019s been a nightmare since. (Forces a stiff shrug) Maybe I should\u2019ve just retired when my mom told me to."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like that incident has stayed with you. Have you noticed any changes in your symptoms since that time, or any patterns that stand out?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Harder to... focus on anything. I stay up late, even with the chamomile. (Twists scrubs, avoids eye contact) My mind just replays that call. And... (voice drops) sometimes I snap at Mark over nothing. Tell myself it\u2019s the hormones, but... (pauses, shrugs stiffly) ...it\u2019s not like I used to be. I just want to function without... shaking."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the changes in your mood and behavior are adding to the weight you're already carrying. How often have these moments of snapping at Mark happened since the sleep issues started?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s... more often than I\u2019d like. Maybe a few times a week? I tell myself it\u2019s the stress, you know? Or the sleep. But it\u2019s not like I used to be. (Twists scrubs, avoids eye contact) Mark doesn\u2019t say much, but I can see it in his face. Like he\u2019s waiting for me to snap again."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the incident at work has added a heavy layer of self-criticism to an already overwhelming situation. Have you experienced similar episodes of feeling overwhelmed or down in the past, and if so, what helped you at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, this is... the first time it's been like this. I mean, stress happens, but... this feels different. (Twists scrubs) Used to just push through, but now... even that doesn't work. (Avoids eye contact) The call was the first real crack. Before that, I could... pretend I was still in control."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the recent incident has intensified a sense of losing control that\u2019s been building. How has your work environment or job pressures been affecting you in the past few months?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s... it\u2019s been harder to focus. I\u2019ve been triple-checking equipment, just... making sure I don\u2019t slip up again. But the more I try to stay on top of it, the more I feel like I\u2019m one mistake away from losing everything. Sleep\u2019s been worse\u2014wake up at 3 a.m. and can\u2019t shake the panic. It\u2019s just... a rough patch. You know how jobs get sometimes."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure to perform perfectly is adding to your exhaustion. How has your partner been supporting you through this difficult time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Mark... he brings me coffee every morning. Says it helps me focus. I guess it does. But I snap at him sometimes. You know, little things. I tell him it\u2019s the hormones. It\u2019s not... it\u2019s just stress. Keeping things together is hard. I don\u2019t want to weigh him down. (Twists scrubs, avoiding eye contact.) He\u2019s been good. Patient. I appreciate that."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the weight changes and self-criticism are really adding to your distress. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I guess I\u2019ve had those thoughts. Not like I\u2019d do anything stupid, though. It\u2019s just... sometimes I wonder why I bother. But I have to keep going, right? For Mark. (Fingers twist fabric of scrubs.) The doctor gave me pills, but I haven\u2019t needed them. Coffee\u2019s been enough to keep me awake."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to keep going for Mark's sake. Have these thoughts about ending your life included any specific plans or intentions to act on them?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No... no plans. I just... lock the pill bottle. You know, so Mark doesn\u2019t worry. (Fingers tighten on scrubs, then release.) It\u2019s not like I\u2019d use them. I\u2019m not that stupid. But sometimes I think about how easy it would be. If I just... let go. But I can\u2019t. He\u2019d notice. And I don\u2019t want to drag him down anymore."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how much you\u2019re carrying for Mark, and it\u2019s clear you care deeply about not burdening him. When you think about 'letting go,' what does that mean for you? Are you thinking about ending your life, or is it more about giving up in some other way?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I don\u2019t know. Letting go\u2014it\u2019s like... the weight of everything just... stopping. But I can\u2019t. Mark needs me. I have to keep going. Even if it\u2019s hard. Even if I feel like I\u2019m failing. (Twists scrubs, voice softens.) It\u2019s not about... plans. Just... sometimes I wonder if I have the strength. But I don\u2019t want him to see me break."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how much you're prioritizing Mark's well-being even when you feel like you're struggling. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use recently, or been using other substances to cope with the stress?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I don\u2019t really use anything. Maybe a glass of wine sometimes. But it\u2019s just... to help me wind down. You know, with the shifts and everything. Mark doesn\u2019t drink, so I don\u2019t want to do it in front of him. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019m... losing control or anything. I still have to be sharp for work. The tea helps more, honestly. Chamomile. It\u2019s... it\u2019s just easier to lock the pill bottle than to explain why I can\u2019t sleep. You know how that goes."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're managing with small amounts of alcohol and herbal tea. Have you used cannabis in the past few months?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No... no, I haven\u2019t touched it. Not since last year, anyway. The last time... just didn\u2019t sit right with Mark. (pauses, fingers curling into the fabric of her scrubs) But the wine? Maybe once or twice. Only on nights I\u2019m home alone. The pill bottle\u2019s still locked, though. (forces a small, tired smile) You know how it is\u2014better safe than sorry, right?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how you're balancing things carefully at home. Can you tell me about any medications or supplements you're currently taking, including the ones you mentioned earlier?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The pill bottle... it\u2019s just the antidepressants they prescribed. I keep it locked up. You know how it goes\u2014don\u2019t want Mark to see it, makes things feel... official. The tea\u2019s just chamomile, honestly. It\u2019s the only thing that doesn\u2019t taste like regret. (pauses, fingers tightening on her scrubs) I don\u2019t really take the pills though. They make me too... foggy. Can\u2019t afford to be slow at work."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the side effects of the antidepressants are impacting your work performance. Are there any other medications or supplements you're currently taking besides the antidepressants and chamomile tea?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No... just the antidepressants. I don\u2019t really take them though. They make me too foggy. (twists scrubs, avoids eye contact) Sometimes I take Tylenol for headaches, but that\u2019s it. The wine? Maybe once in a while. Only when Mark\u2019s not home. The pill bottle\u2019s still locked up. (forces a small shrug) You know how it is\u2014don\u2019t want to complicate things more than they already are."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I see you're managing with Tylenol and minimal alcohol use. Have you noticed any periods in the last few months where you felt unusually energetic, had a lot of ideas, or needed very little sleep?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No... no, not really. I\u2019ve been more... tired. Some nights I can\u2019t sleep, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m energized or anything. I just... can\u2019t shut my brain off. (tugs at the hem of her scrubs) The crime shows help me stay awake sometimes. It\u2019s not that I have energy\u2014just... can\u2019t let go. You know how that goes."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're managing sleep difficulties without increased energy or restlessness. Have you noticed any periods in the last few months where you felt overly excited about an activity or took more risks than usual, like spending sprees, impulsive decisions, or reckless behavior?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I... I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve been too tired to even think about risks. Mostly just trying not to mess up at work. (Twists scrubs) My coffee habit\u2019s worse, though. I guess that\u2019s... something? But it\u2019s just to stay awake. (Pauses, looks down) You know how it is when you\u2019re trying to hold things together."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me recap what I\u2019ve heard so far: You\u2019ve been struggling with overwhelming sadness, sleepless nights, and difficulty focusing at work for over a year, especially after a stressful incident where you felt you failed. These symptoms have affected your relationships, led to weight changes, and left you feeling like a burden. You\u2019ve also mentioned moments of passive hopelessness, though you\u2019re trying to stay strong for your partner. Does this capture your experience, or is there something I missed?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, that\u2019s... that\u2019s about it. The coffee\u2019s gotten worse, though. I mean, it\u2019s just to stay awake during shifts, but sometimes it\u2019s the only thing that... that keeps me from just... freezing, I guess. (Twists scrubs, avoids eye contact) And Mark... I don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m a burden. I try not to let him see how bad it gets. But I can\u2019t even remember the last time I felt okay."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What would be the most helpful next step for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t know. Maybe... just figuring out how to get through the shifts without freezing up. (Twists scrubs) If I could trust myself to not mess up, maybe the sleep would come easier. But... (pauses) I guess you already knew that. It\u2019s just... it\u2019s just about holding it together long enough to... to not let go, you know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure to perform at work while managing your sleep and self-doubt is creating a really tight loop for you. Let me try to summarize: Over the past year and a half, a critical incident at work triggered intense guilt and fear of failure, which has since spiraled into chronic insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and strained relationships. You're carrying a heavy burden of self-criticism, trying to hold everything together for your partner while secretly fearing you're falling apart. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, that... that\u2019s pretty much it. The coffee\u2019s the only thing that keeps me from... from freezing during shifts. But it\u2019s like, the more I need it, the worse I feel. (Twists scrubs, avoids eye contact) And the pill bottle\u2014I lock it, even though I don\u2019t take them. It\u2019s just... something to do. (Softly) Mark doesn\u2019t know about that. I guess... I guess I\u2019m just trying to hold on, but some days, I don\u2019t know how much longer I can."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure to perform at work while managing your sleep and self-doubt is creating a really tight loop for you. Let me try to summarize: Over the past year and a half, a critical incident at work triggered intense guilt and fear of failure, which has since spiraled into chronic insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and strained relationships. You're carrying a heavy burden of self-criticism, trying to hold everything together for your partner while secretly fearing you're falling apart. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, that\u2019s... that\u2019s about right. (Twists scrubs, glances at hands) The pill bottle thing\u2014it\u2019s just... habit, I guess. Even when I don\u2019t take them, locking it up... it\u2019s like a switch. Off. (Forces a small, humorless smile) And the crime shows? They keep me... awake past midnight. Feels like the only thing that does. (Pauses, voice softens) Mark doesn\u2019t know how much I... how much I\u2019m holding in. But if I start unraveling, I don\u2019t know if I can stitch myself back up."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like holding on has been a mix of small rituals and quiet endurance. Before we decide on next steps, is there anything else that feels important to add about how you're managing\u2014or not managing\u2014these challenges?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The coffee... it keeps me going. And folding laundry, getting the lines straight\u2014it\u2019s the only thing I don\u2019t mess up anymore. But my sister\u2019s been through a lot lately, and I just... can\u2019t seem to be there for her. You know how family gets."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the small routines like folding laundry are a way you\u2019re maintaining a sense of control, even as family responsibilities feel overwhelming. How has your sister\u2019s situation been affecting you lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s... hard not to feel like I\u2019m failing her. I haven\u2019t called enough. Haven\u2019t been there. (Twists scrubs, voice drops) She\u2019s going through enough, and I\u2019m just... stuck here. It makes me irritable, you know? Like, why can\u2019t I be better at this? (Pauses, avoids eye contact) But I\u2019m not even sure what \u2018better\u2019 would look like anymore."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your sister\u2019s struggles are adding to the weight you\u2019re carrying, especially with the guilt of not being there for her. What did I miss or get wrong about how these responsibilities are shaping your sense of \u2018better\u2019 right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s... it\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop where I want to be there for her but I can\u2019t even take care of myself. (Twists scrubs, avoids eye contact) She\u2019s fighting something big, and I just keep thinking I\u2019m another thing she has to worry about. The \u2018better\u2019 part? I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s just... not being such a burden. But I don\u2019t know how to do that."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the weight of wanting to support your sister while struggling to care for yourself is central to what \u2018better\u2019 means right now. What would you like to focus on next in terms of support or changes that might help with this?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I guess I\u2019d want to stop feeling like I\u2019m letting everyone down. Even if it\u2019s just... small things. Like calling my sister without it turning into this huge effort. But I don\u2019t know how to do that. (Twists scrubs, pauses) Maybe if I could stop second-guessing everything at work, I\u2019d have more energy for anything else. Or maybe that\u2019s just another way of avoiding it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That must be really tough, feeling like you're letting people down when you're already struggling so much. Let me try to piece this together: Over the past year and a half, a critical incident at work triggered intense guilt and fear of failure, leading to chronic insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and strained relationships. You're carrying a heavy burden of self-criticism, trying to hold everything together for your partner and sister while secretly fearing you're falling apart. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You didn\u2019t mention my sister\u2019s cancer. She\u2019s... fighting it. You know how family gets. (Twists scrubs, voice tightens) And the pill bottle\u2014I lock it, but I don\u2019t take them. It\u2019s just... habit."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your sister\u2019s cancer has added another layer of guilt and pressure, especially with the pill bottle habit becoming a silent ritual. What else feels important to include before we shape next steps together?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I guess my sister\u2019s diagnosis just hits me harder than I let on. I should be there for her, but I can\u2019t even take my own pills. It\u2019s stupid, right? (Twists scrubs) Mark brings coffee every morning\u2014it\u2019s the only thing that tastes real anymore. I don\u2019t want to talk about the rest. It\u2019s just... noise."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your sister's diagnosis has added a heavy layer of guilt and pressure, especially when it feels like you can't even care for yourself. What would you like to focus on next in terms of support or changes that might help with this?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t know... Maybe just... having someone check in? Not like therapy, just... knowing someone cares enough to ask. (Twists scrubs) But I can\u2019t even keep my own routine straight, so who\u2019s gonna care about me? Mark\u2019s coffee helps, but it\u2019s not... enough. (Pauses, looks down) I guess I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll mess up again\u2014work, family, everything. It\u2019s like the machine\u2019s running but nothing\u2019s connected."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your sister\u2019s cancer diagnosis and the ritual of locking the pill bottle have become central to your sense of control and guilt. What did I miss or get wrong about how these factors fit into your current struggles?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think... you missed how the pill bottle isn\u2019t just about the pills. It\u2019s like\u2014if I can\u2019t even handle that, what else am I screwing up? (Twists scrubs) And the coffee... it\u2019s the only thing that tastes real. But I\u2019m scared to let go, even for a second. (Looks at hands) Mark... he\u2019s the only thing keeping me together. I don\u2019t want to mess him up too."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your sister\u2019s cancer, the pill bottle ritual, and Mark\u2019s support are central to how you\u2019re navigating this pressure. What else feels important to include before we shape next steps together?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The 3 a.m. panic... it\u2019s like my mind won\u2019t let me rest. Even if I fall asleep, I wake up shaking. It\u2019s not just the pill bottle\u2014it\u2019s the feeling that if I let go, everything collapses. (Twists scrubs) Mark\u2019s coffee is real, but it can\u2019t fix that. I guess... the crime shows keep me awake past midnight. It\u2019s stupid, but it feels like I\u2019m *doing* something, you know? Like I\u2019m not just... falling apart."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds incredibly isolating, like you're balancing on a tightrope where every misstep feels catastrophic. Let me try to integrate what's emerged: Over the past year and a half, a critical work error triggered a spiral of guilt and hypervigilance, leading to chronic 3 a.m. panic awakenings, self-soothing rituals (pill bottle, coffee, crime shows), and a desperate need to 'stay connected' through small acts like folding laundry. This has created a fragile equilibrium where you fear both collapse and being a burden to Mark. What did I miss or get wrong about how these threads are woven together?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think... you missed how my mom\u2019s voice still lives in my head. 'Only as good as your work.' Even now. And Mark... I\u2019m scared if I break, he\u2019ll see I\u2019m not worth fixing. (Twists scrubs, voice cracks) My sister\u2019s sick, and I can\u2019t even be there for her. It\u2019s like... another weight I can\u2019t name out loud."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your mother\u2019s critical voice and fear of disappointing Mark are deeply woven into your sense of self-worth, especially with your sister\u2019s illness adding to the weight. What did I miss or get wrong about how these threads connect to your current struggles?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re\u2026 not wrong. The mom stuff, the work stuff\u2014it\u2019s all tangled. But maybe you missed how my sister\u2019s sick and I\u2026 I don\u2019t even know how to be there for her. (Pauses, twists scrubs) It\u2019s like another weight I can\u2019t name out loud. And the pill bottle\u2014I lock it to prove I\u2019m in control, but it just\u2026 it just feels like a lie to Mark. Like I\u2019m waiting for him to see I\u2019m breaking."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your sister\u2019s cancer diagnosis and the ritual of locking the pill bottle have become central to your sense of control and guilt. What else feels important to include before we shape next steps together?"}
