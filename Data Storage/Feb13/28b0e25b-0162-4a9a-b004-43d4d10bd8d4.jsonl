{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hello, Ms. Turner. Thank you for coming in today. To start, would you like to share your preferred name or pronouns, or are you comfortable with me using Jody?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, Jody's fine. I'm not really one for complicating things, you know? Just call me Jody."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Would you like me to explain the purpose of today's session and how it will go?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Um, I guess... I just want to get through this without wasting anyone's time. Is this like the standard check-up stuff? I had a rough night, my hands are still a little shaky, but I'm here, aren't I?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're feeling quite overwhelmed right now. Would you be comfortable continuing with the session as we discussed?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess so... it\u2019s just, my hands are still shaking something awful. Can we maybe get through this without too much... you know, going in circles? I had a rough night, but I\u2019m here, aren\u2019t I?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really tough. Just to make sure we\u2019re aligned, today\u2019s session will involve discussing your current concerns and how we can support you. Does that sound okay?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess that\u2019s... fine. Just don\u2019t mind the shaking, it\u2019s this stupid coffee I drank to stay awake. Honestly, it\u2019s all the same stuff\u2014money, the kids, that cough I keep putting off. But let\u2019s get through this, yeah? My grandson\u2019s birthday is next week, at least that\u2019s something to focus on."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That\u2019s a good goal to have. Before we move forward, do you have any questions about what we\u2019ll be discussing today or how the process works?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I guess not... unless there\u2019s something specific you need from me. I just hope we don\u2019t end up circling the same old stuff again, you know? My hands are still shaking from that coffee, but I\u2019ll power through. It\u2019s just... been a long few months."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Can you tell me more about the main concerns that have been on your mind lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Ugh... it\u2019s the usual, I guess. The cough\u2019s been driving me nuts\u2014probably just allergies or something, but it\u2019s keeping me up at night. And then there\u2019s the rent increase, the dog next door that won\u2019t stop barking... it all just adds up. My son\u2019s in over his head with student loans, and my daughter\u2019s been so quiet since her breakup. I tell myself it\u2019s normal stuff, but half the time I can\u2019t even focus on baking cookies without second-guessing every step. It\u2019s like my brain\u2019s on loop, you know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really frustrating and exhausting. Can you tell me when you first started feeling this overwhelmed and how long these stressors have been affecting you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It's been... hard to pinpoint exactly when it all started, but I guess the divorce two years ago really tilted things. Before that, I was busy trying to keep everything together for the kids, you know? Now it's like the weight just... settled. The cough's been going on since last winter, and the rent increase hit around the same time. I can't even bake without my hands shaking, and sleep? Ugh, I count sheep till 3 a.m. then lie there replaying every stupid bill I haven't paid. It's just... normal adult stuff, right? Everyone's stressed about money and their kids these days."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds incredibly heavy to carry alone. What are you hoping to achieve by coming in for support now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... I want to figure out how to stop letting all this stuff eat at me. You know, like actually sleep without counting every missed bill. My hands still shake when I try to make cookies for little Ethan\u2019s birthday, and I don\u2019t want to mess up that for him. But I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s even what this is for\u2014I just keep thinking there\u2019s something I\u2019m supposed to fix here."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds important that Ethan\u2019s birthday is a priority for you, even as everything feels overwhelming. How long have you noticed your hands shaking when you try to do things like bake or handle small objects?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s been about two years, I suppose\u2014since the divorce really knocked me off balance. At first, it was just my hands trembling when I\u2019d try to measure flour or anything precise. Now it\u2019s worse. I\u2019ll reach for a spoon and my fingers slip, so I just use a bigger utensil and tell myself it\u2019s \u2018getting older\u2019 or \u2018too much caffeine.\u2019 But lately, even that feels like a chore. It\u2019s not like I can just... stop them from shaking, you know? It\u2019s there, constant, like another voice in my head I can\u2019t shut off."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like this has been a long and challenging journey for you. Have you experienced similar episodes of overwhelm and anxiety in the past, and if so, what helped you manage them?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess you could say I\u2019ve always been a nervous type, but it\u2019s gotten... worse, I guess? After the divorce, money stuff, the kids\u2019 problems\u2014it just stacks up. I try to handle it by, y\u2019know, making lists, doing the crossword every day. Black tea helps, maybe? Keeps my hands steady enough. But honestly, most days I just feel like I\u2019m one missed payment away from falling apart. My grandson\u2019s birthday next week is the only thing that\u2019s kept me from... I don\u2019t know, disappearing into the couch. But I\u2019m probably just being dramatic. Again."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your grandson\u2019s birthday gives you a sense of purpose during tough times. Who do you usually turn to when things feel overwhelming, or is there someone who has helped you in the past?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t usually... bother anyone, you know? I mean, who\u2019s got time for that? My sister\u2019s got her own messes, and I don\u2019t want to be the drama queen in someone else\u2019s story. But Ethan\u2014my grandson\u2014he\u2019s the one thing that keeps me from... from letting the whole pile of crap just crush me. I guess I\u2019ll call his mom once in a while to double-check the birthday plans, but even that feels like a burden. Most days, it\u2019s just me, the tea, and these damn shaky hands. I\u2019m probably overthinking it all, though. Kids\u2019 birthdays are probably not that big a deal in the grand scheme of things."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you've been carrying a lot of stress and worry lately. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t think about... you know, stuff like that. Not really. I mean, some days I feel like I\u2019m just... dragging myself through the motions. But Ethan\u2019s birthday is in a week, and I can\u2019t let him down. That\u2019s probably why I\u2019m still here, honestly. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard worse stories. Probably just stress, you know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s clear Ethan\u2019s birthday is a meaningful goal for you. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or restless, even with little sleep?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t know... I guess when I can\u2019t sleep, I just end up pacing the apartment, checking the mail, re-doing the same crossword puzzle over... you know, stuff like that. My hands still shake bad enough I spill half the tea I\u2019m trying to drink. But it\u2019s probably just me being a nervous wreck over Ethan\u2019s birthday. Who cares if I look a little... frayed? As long as the cookies don\u2019t crumble, right?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're really trying to stay on top of things despite feeling overwhelmed. Have you been drinking alcohol more or less than usual lately, or using any other substances like cannabis or prescription medications?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Nope, not really. I don\u2019t drink much\u2014maybe a glass of wine once in a blue moon, but mostly just tea. Black tea, lots of it. Helps with the nerves, I guess? Though even the tea\u2019s been shaking out of my hands more lately. But Ethan\u2019s birthday\u2019s in a week, so I\u2019ve been trying to stay... focused. You know how it is."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thanks for sharing that. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including things like vitamins or over-the-counter remedies, to manage your symptoms or other health concerns?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t take anything\u2014meds or supplements. Not since the divorce, anyway. I used to have a prescription for sleep once, but that didn\u2019t work. Now it\u2019s just\u2026 tea. Black tea. A lot of it. Helps me focus, I guess. Though half the time I\u2019m too shaky to hold the cup straight. Ethan\u2019s birthday baking\u2019s the only thing keeping me from forgetting how to hold anything at all."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the restlessness you're experiencing is quite challenging. Have you noticed any times when you feel like you need less sleep or have more energy than usual during these restless periods?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, it\u2019s the opposite. I can\u2019t seem to rest even when I\u2019m exhausted. The tea keeps me awake sometimes, but when I finally do lie down\u2026 my mind\u2019s just a hamster wheel. Worrying about Ethan\u2019s birthday supplies, or if the rent\u2019s going up again. My hands shake worse when I can\u2019t sleep\u2014like they\u2019re trying to take over the whole arm. You\u2019d think if I just checked the mail one more time, something would fix itself, but it never does."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your worries are really affecting your physical comfort. Have you noticed any experiences where you hear voices, see things others don\u2019t, or have strong beliefs that others might find unusual or paranoid?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t hear voices or see things. But\u2026 sometimes I catch myself thinking my ex might be saying bad things to the kids about me. Not that it makes sense, right? I mean, there\u2019s no proof. It\u2019s just\u2026 static in my head, same as everything else. My hands start shaking again when I dwell on it, so I focus on Ethan\u2019s birthday stuff. Keeps me from spiraling, even if it\u2019s just cookies and wrapping paper."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like those thoughts about your ex can be really unsettling for you. Have you noticed any other experiences where you feel like people are talking about you or acting in ways that seem suspicious, even if it doesn't make sense?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess you could say... sometimes I catch people looking at me in the grocery store. Like the other day, this woman at the bakery aisle kept staring. My first thought was, 'She\u2019s judging me for being alone,' but that\u2019s probably just me being dramatic. My hands got all shaky again, so I hurried to check Ethan\u2019s cupcake order. It\u2019s just... static, I know. But the shaking? That\u2019s real."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That must be distressing to feel so self-conscious in public. Have you noticed any medical issues that might be contributing to your symptoms, such as thyroid problems or chronic pain?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly? I\u2019ve been putting off the doctor about this cough\u2014it\u2019s been months, but I tell myself it\u2019s just allergies or age. My hands still shake when I try to do anything precise, like wrapping Ethan\u2019s gifts. The fatigue? That\u2019s just\u2026 life, right? You know how it is. At least baking for the birthday gives me something solid to focus on. Keeps me from\u2026 overthinking."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Jody, from what we\u2019ve discussed, it sounds like your anxiety and physical symptoms\u2014like the tremors and sleep issues\u2014have been building for years, especially since the divorce, and they\u2019re now making it hard to manage daily tasks and care for yourself. The stress of finances, family worries, and your cough are adding to that pressure, but your focus on Ethan\u2019s birthday shows there\u2019s still something you\u2019re holding onto. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess you didn\u2019t mention how my dad\u2019s joblessness taught me to panic over every late bill, you know? And the cough\u2026 it\u2019s been there for months, but I keep telling myself it\u2019s \u2018just my age.\u2019 As for Ethan\u2019s cookies\u2026 my hands shake so bad when I try to frost them, I\u2019m half-convinced I\u2019ll end up with a plate of abstract art. But fine, maybe the doctor appointment isn\u2019t *totally* avoidable anymore."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your father\u2019s experiences with joblessness have shaped how you handle financial stress, and the cough and hand tremors are adding to your daily challenges. What else have we missed that\u2019s important to include?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess there\u2019s... I don\u2019t know, this thing with my ex? He\u2019s probably just being dramatic, but I can\u2019t stop thinking he\u2019s badmouthing me to the kids. And that stupid dog next door\u2014howl every time I try to watch *Golden Girls* or bake in peace. Ethan\u2019s cookies are the only thing that makes me feel like I\u2019m doing *something* right, but now even that feels like a chore. Sorry, this is probably too much."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your concerns about your ex's behavior and the neighbor's dog are adding to your stress, and that Ethan\u2019s cookies, once a comfort, now feel like a burden. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... the cough\u2019s been there so long I just write it off as \u2018old lady lungs,\u2019 but it\u2019s been months. And the ex? I know it\u2019s probably nothing, but what if he\u2019s really making me out to be some monster to the kids? And that dog? Howl every time I try to make those cookies without crying. My hands shake so bad now, I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll ruin Ethan\u2019s birthday. Sorry, I\u2019m just... too much, aren\u2019t I?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your physical symptoms, family stressors, and financial worries are interconnected, and your efforts to prepare for Ethan\u2019s birthday show your strength. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... you didn\u2019t mention how I feel like I\u2019ve lost my purpose since I quit working. I used to have a routine, now I\u2019m just... waiting for the bills to come or for something to go wrong. And baking? I used to love it, but now I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll burn the cookies and ruin Ethan\u2019s day. It\u2019s stupid, right? Probably just more stress."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like losing your purpose and the pressure around Ethan\u2019s cookies are really weighing on you. Before we plan next steps, is there anything else I\u2019ve missed that\u2019s important to include?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... there\u2019s the thing about my hands. They\u2019re not just shaking when I\u2019m baking\u2014they do it when I\u2019m trying to write a check, or hold my phone. It\u2019s like my body\u2019s decided I\u2019m not trustworthy with anything. And I don\u2019t even know if the doctor\u2019ll help, but maybe if I go... maybe I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m doing something instead of just waiting for the worst."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s clear how important Ethan\u2019s birthday is to you. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you\u2019d like to discuss or clarify about next steps?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... the doctor\u2019s appointment I\u2019ve been putting off. It\u2019s probably just stress, but this cough won\u2019t go away. And my hands still shake when I\u2019m trying to do something simple, like frost cookies for Ethan. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s anything to worry about, though. Maybe I\u2019m just overthinking, as usual."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like scheduling that doctor\u2019s appointment could help ease some of this uncertainty. Would you be open to discussing how we might support that next step, or is there anything else about Ethan\u2019s birthday plans you\u2019d like to address before we wrap up?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly? I\u2019m not sure what else there is to say about the doctor. It\u2019s just... a cough, right? Probably nothing. I mean, my hands still shake when I try to frost those cookies for Ethan, but I\u2019ll figure it out. Black tea helps a little. Anyway\u2014Ethan\u2019s birthday is next week. I want to make sure the cupcakes don\u2019t end up on the floor this time. That\u2019s... that\u2019s the important thing."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s clear how meaningful Ethan\u2019s birthday is to you. How would you feel about scheduling that doctor\u2019s appointment to address the cough and hand tremors, so you can feel more confident and comfortable baking the cupcakes?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I guess I could call them. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019m getting any younger, right? Black tea\u2019s been my only \u2018medicine\u2019 lately, but if it\u2019ll help me stop shaking when I frost those cupcakes for Ethan, sure. Just don\u2019t want to waste time if it\u2019s nothing. You know how it is. But the kid\u2019s birthday\u2019s next week\u2014I can\u2019t let him see me mess up the cookies again. That\u2019s the least I can do."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s clear how much Ethan means to you, and I admire your commitment to making his birthday special. Before we finish, would you like to share any final thoughts or questions, or shall we wrap up with the next steps we discussed?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess that\u2019s it, really. I\u2019ll call the doctor... if the tea doesn\u2019t \u2018fix\u2019 it by then. Just... don\u2019t want Ethan to see me fumbling the cupcakes again. Black tea\u2019s my only trick left, but if I can frost one batch without spilling, maybe the rest will follow. Let\u2019s... let\u2019s wrap it up. I\u2019ve got a list of colors to pick for his balloons. Can\u2019t have him thinking Grandma\u2019s still \u2018on edge,\u2019 right?"}
