{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hello Jennifer, I'm Corey Fitzgerald. To start, is there a preferred name or pronouns I should use with you today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s Jennifer. No preferred pronouns\u2014I guess? Just call me Jennifer. I\u2019m\u2026 easy like that. My coworkers say I\u2019m the \u2018model employee,\u2019 ha. I just like knowing where I stand, you know? Less room for\u2026 mistakes."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a good approach to staying on top of things. Jennifer, just to set the frame, today\u2019s session will involve discussing your concerns and how we can support you. Does that sound okay with you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, sure. I mean, I guess talking through things can help. At work, we have checklists to make sure everything\u2019s done right\u2026 maybe this is like that? As long as we stick to the plan, I can handle it. I just\u2026 hope we don\u2019t get stuck in loops, you know? My head\u2019s already scrubbing tiles nonstop tonight."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your honesty about how your mind feels right now. Do you have any immediate questions about how this session will go before we begin?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t think so. The plan is\u2026 good. At work, we stick to checklists so nothing slips through, you know? I just hope we can stay on track. My head\u2019s already on the wash cycle tonight, but I guess that\u2019s normal? I\u2019ll manage."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the fear of losing your job or pushing people away feels really pressing for you. Can you tell me when you first noticed these worries starting?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It started... I guess during the pandemic? When they made us disinfect everything, not just clean. I wanted to do it 'perfectly' so no one got sick, but then my brain kept replaying 'What if I missed a spot?' Even after things eased up, the... the hyper-checking stayed. My dad used to snap, 'Worry fixes nothing!' but I guess that's just how I roll. It's like my head's stuck on the 'scrub mode' switch, you know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really frustrating. Can you tell me how this has affected your personal relationships or daily self-care routines outside of work?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly, it\u2019s... I guess it makes me kind of a terrible hostess? My sister\u2019s going through chemo, but I can\u2019t even bring myself to visit without double-checking my bank account for three days straight. I started drinking more wine, but I tell myself it\u2019s \u2018social\u2019 even when I\u2019m just on the balcony alone with my herbs. My hands don\u2019t always cooperate when I try to prune them, though\u2014cramp up like I\u2019m scrubbing tiles again. My niece says I\u2019m \u2018funny when I let myself be,\u2019 but I mess up most days by over-apologizing or... well, just not being there. Haha. I\u2019m a professional over-functioner, I guess."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your body is reacting physically to the stress you're carrying. When did you first start noticing the hand cramps when you try to prune your herbs?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think it started... maybe a year ago? Around when the pandemic really took hold? I was so focused on scrubbing everything at work that my hands just... got stuck in 'scrub mode,' even when I wasn\u2019t doing anything. Now when I try to prune my basil, my fingers lock up like I\u2019m still wiping down doorknobs. My niece says I \u2018grip like I\u2019m cleaning a germ-infested toilet,\u2019 which is kind of true. I guess it\u2019s just... hard to untangle them from all the other tension?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your hands are carrying a lot of that stress. What would you most like to achieve through our work together?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... I\u2019d like to stop gripping everything so tight, you know? Like my herbs\u2014they don\u2019t need me to be perfect, just present. Maybe if my hands would stop cramping, I could actually enjoy tending them instead of dreading it. And maybe... not over-checking every bill until I\u2019m dizzy. Small things, I know."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the hand cramps are adding to the frustration of wanting to connect with your herbs. Can you tell me how often you experience these cramps, and are there other situations besides pruning where this happens?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s... more often than I\u2019d like to admit. Even when I\u2019m just washing dishes or holding my phone too long, my fingers sort of... clench up like they\u2019re still in \u2018scrub mode.\u2019 I guess it\u2019s just my hands being dramatic about everything, even small stuff. My niece says they \u2018remember the pandemic better than I do,\u2019 which is probably true. I try to laugh it off, but it\u2019s hard not to feel like my body\u2019s stuck on repeat sometimes. Haha\u2014do you get how that makes sense?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you've been managing a lot at work and home while trying to stay on top of things. Have you experienced similar episodes of anxiety or perfectionism in the past, and if so, what helped you manage them back then?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... I\u2019ve always been the type to \u2018overprepare\u2019? Like, my dad used to snap at me for worrying too much, so I just got really good at double-checking everything\u2014like, washing a doorknob seven times until it \u2018felt right.\u2019 Back then, I thought it was just being responsible. Now? It\u2019s the same habits, but they\u2019re like... gremlins in my head, you know? They\u2019ll wash dishes until they\u2019re \u2018germ-free\u2019 but then make me second-guess the bills for hours. Haha. My body\u2019s still on \u2018scrub mode,\u2019 but my brain\u2019s just... adding more tasks. Forever."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really tough to carry those habits from childhood into adulthood. Can you tell me more about how your relationship with your father shaped your approach to responsibility and mistakes back then?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Ugh. My dad was like... a scrub brush set to 'never stop.' If I messed up, he\u2019d bark, 'Worry fixes nothing!' but then I\u2019d worry harder to prove I wasn\u2019t lazy. Now I guess I\u2019m stuck in this loop where I over-plan my cleaning routes just to avoid 'looking bad' at work. My hands cramp from gripping the spray bottle too tight, but I can\u2019t slow down\u2014I\u2019m always trying to fix things before they break. Even my sister\u2019s chemo bills? I keep thinking, 'If I just check the numbers one more time, maybe I\u2019ll find a solution.' It\u2019s like my brain\u2019s a sink that won\u2019t stop leaking. Haha\u2014if that makes sense?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds incredibly burdensome to carry both your own anxiety and your sister's medical stressors. How has her chemo treatment and the financial concerns around it been affecting your anxiety specifically?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s a lot to juggle, honestly. I guess I feel... like I\u2019m holding a bunch of plates spinning, but one\u2019s cracked (pauses, rubs hands together). The chemo bills? I keep checking the numbers on my phone, even though I know I can\u2019t magic money into existence. My hands get these cramps from gripping the phone too tight\u2014it\u2019s like my body\u2019s trying to scrub the stress away. I hate that I can\u2019t just... visit her more, but every day I don\u2019t go feels like I\u2019m letting her down. Then I tell myself, \u2018Jennifer, you\u2019re being silly,\u2019 and take a swig of my \u2018social\u2019 wine. Haha\u2014if that makes sense?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to ask about your alcohol use. How often have you been drinking wine, and have you noticed any changes in how you use it recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s\u2026 a few times a week, maybe? Like, after shifts or when the bills feel like another pass at Scrub Mode. I tell myself it\u2019s \u2018social,\u2019 but really it\u2019s just\u2026 softening the edges of the noise. My hands still clench the glass until they cramp, though. Haha\u2014guess I\u2019m just collecting wine-glass calluses instead of cleaning ones now. Not a habit I\u2019d call \u2018recent,\u2019 but\u2026 maybe I\u2019m using it more when the chemo numbers feel too sharp to swallow. If that makes sense?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the wine helps you manage stress, but also notice the physical tension it brings. Have you used any other substances, like cannabis, stimulants, or opioids, either recently or in the past?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, nothing else\u2014wine\u2019s my... I guess you could say my \u2018go-to\u2019 for unwinding? I tried edibles once with friends years ago, but the paranoia hit harder than the relaxation. Now that sounds dramatic, right? I\u2019m not even sure why I mentioned that. And stimulants? Please, I\u2019m already running on fumes most days. Opioids? No way, I\u2019d rather scrub floors forever than mess with that. Though... my hands still cramp from gripping the glass so tight. Haha\u2014if that makes sense?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to check in about your safety. Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No\u2014no actual plans or anything. I guess... sometimes I wonder if it would just stop the noise, but then I think about my niece\u2019s drawings on the fridge and feel selfish even thinking it. Haha, my hands get all clammy just talking about this. I\u2019d rather... I\u2019d rather scrub floors forever, really. Even if my hands cramp the whole time."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your niece's drawings give you a sense of purpose and motivation to keep going. Have you noticed any changes in how much you need to sleep or if you feel more energetic than usual lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess my sleep\u2019s been... jagged? Like, I\u2019ll lie there counting the minutes until I have to get up for work. My hands cramp up sometimes, even when I\u2019m just trying to hold a glass of wine. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m exhausted, but I feel... frayed? If that makes sense. Haha, I\u2019m just being dramatic, right? It\u2019s probably just stress from the bills and everything."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the frayed feeling is connected to both your physical tension and mental fatigue. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels lately\u2014either feeling more energized than usual or more drained than typical?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... I feel like I'm running on, like, 30% battery most days? But I just keep hitting the 'play' button because there's no time to recharge. My hands still cramp when I'm doing dishes or holding my phone, which is weird because I'm not even lifting anything heavy. Haha, I'm just a human rechargeable, I guess. If that makes sense?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the physical and mental fatigue is really taking a toll. Have you noticed any times when you feel more energetic or have less need for sleep than usual, even if it's temporary?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Eh, maybe when I\u2019m in \u2018scrub mode\u2019? Like that one time I stayed up past midnight disinfecting the whole bathroom just to feel... in control? But that\u2019s not really energy, right? More like panic with a flashlight. My hands cramp so bad after that, I can\u2019t even text my sister back without wincing. Haha, sounds crazy, but it\u2019s just... the way the day goes, I guess?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the physical strain from your 'scrub mode' energy is really impacting your hands. When did you first notice these cramps starting, and have they seemed connected to stress or specific tasks?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess the cramps started... maybe around the pandemic? When I was, like, hyper-focused on disinfecting everything? My hands would hurt after scrubbing the same spot three times. Now it\u2019s weird because even scrolling on my phone too long does it. Haha, I\u2019m just... a human rechargeable with poor battery management? If that makes sense?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your 'scrub mode' is more about stress-driven activity. Have you ever had times when you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep, even when you weren't stressed?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Nope, most days I'm just... low battery. Unless I'm in 'scrub mode,' which is more panic than energy. Haha, I guess I'm just a one-trick pony like that. My herbs? Yeah, I can prune those for hours without tiring. But that's 'cause I'm trying not to overwater them... you know, avoid mistakes. If that makes sense?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to make sure I understand your current health picture. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including over-the-counter ones?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No meds, really. Just... a bottle of cheap red wine to keep the thoughts from scrubbing too hard. Ha. I guess you could call it a social lubricant, if that makes sense?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to make sure we cover all bases. Have you ever experienced hearing voices, seeing things that others don\u2019t, or having thoughts that others want to control you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, nothing like that. My head\u2019s more like a radio that\u2019s stuck between stations\u2014just static, you know? I guess if I had voices, they\u2019d be my dad\u2019s old \u2018Worry fixes nothing!\u2019 yell. But that\u2019s just\u2026 me, I think. Ha."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"So, to recap, you've been experiencing persistent anxiety and intrusive thoughts since the pandemic, which have led to compulsive checking and cleaning behaviors. These symptoms are causing physical strain like hand cramps and affecting your work and relationships, especially with your sister undergoing chemo. You've been using wine to cope but want to reduce perfectionism and reconnect with activities like gardening. What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Oh, um... I guess the part about my boss giving me that warning about being late? I think I mentioned it but maybe not how it feels like proof I\u2019m one mistake from being useless. And... there\u2019s my niece\u2019s drawings. They\u2019re all over my fridge, bright and messy. I tell myself that maybe things don\u2019t need to be perfect to be okay. But then I worry I\u2019m just setting her up for disappointment. If that makes sense?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Oh\u2014and the whole thing with my sister's treatments... I can't afford to take unpaid leave, so I just... send get-well cards. It feels like scrubbing my budget into pennies and calling it 'thoughtful.' I guess I'm the worst cousin?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like feeling guilty about not being able to support your sister financially adds to your stress. What else did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The hand cramps... they happen even when I'm just holding a coffee cup at work. And the guilt about my sister\u2014it's like my brain's scrubbing my budget into dust, trying to find more pennies. I guess I drink more wine to... soften the edges. But my niece's drawings... they're messy but bright. Maybe they're trying to tell me something. If that makes sense?"}
