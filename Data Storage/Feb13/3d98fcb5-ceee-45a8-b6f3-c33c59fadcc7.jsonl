{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hi Claudia, thank you for coming in today. To start, may I have your full name and pronouns if you're comfortable sharing?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Claudia Cochran. She\/her. I\u2019ll just\u2026 adjust my scarf, if that\u2019s okay? It\u2019s been giving me a knot in the neck, like holding a brick or something. Should\u2019ve known better than to wear it with a turtleneck. Work\u2019s been crazy\u2014charts, charts, charts\u2014but I\u2019m here, so that\u2019s what matters, right?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you've had a demanding time at work lately. Are you comfortable with me proceeding with today's interview?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, I guess. Let me just\u2026 adjust my scarf again. It\u2019s not helping, but maybe it\u2019ll buy me a minute. Proceed, I suppose. I\u2019ve just been so wound up lately\u2014work, you know, the usual chaos. It\u2019s not *you*, I hope that\u2019s clear. I just\u2026 need to make sure I\u2019m not wasting your time. Is that terrible?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now\u2014would you like me to explain how this session will work before we move forward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Sure, if that\u2019s necessary. I just\u2026 I find structure helps. Like with patient charts\u2014knowing the protocol. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust the process, I just need to know the steps. But maybe that\u2019s just my default setting."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It makes sense that having clear steps can provide a sense of control. How would you feel about me outlining the approximate structure of our session before we continue?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, that would\u2026 that would help, actually. I appreciate it. I just need to make sure I don\u2019t\u2026 you know, derail things with my usual overthinking. My neck\u2019s still screaming like a stressed EKG, but at least I\u2019d have a roadmap. Maybe I can stop circling the same worries like a broken playlist."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how having a clear plan might feel reassuring right now. To outline the session, we\u2019ll start by discussing what\u2019s been troubling you, then explore your thoughts and feelings, and work together to identify strategies that might help. Does that sound okay, or would you like to adjust anything before we begin?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"That sounds... structured, which I guess is what I need. Though my brain\u2019s already drafting ten possible ways this could go off the rails. (Adjusts scarf, fingers lingering at the knot.) My neck\u2019s still holding a brick, but I\u2019ll try to stick to the plan. As long as we don\u2019t... veer into open-ended discussions. They tend to turn into my head\u2019s version of a sieve\u2014everything leaks out."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It makes sense you'd prefer structure to manage the overwhelm. Do you have any questions or need any clarifications before we move forward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Just... one clarification. When you said 'explore your thoughts,' does that mean we\u2019ll stick to specific topics or might it... wander? (Fingers brush scarf knot, then still.) My brain\u2019s already flagging hypotheticals about my partner\u2019s upcoming surgery, rent deadlines, you know\u2014routine stuff. As long as we don\u2019t spiral into \u2018what ifs,\u2019 I can focus. Let\u2019s say... 20-minute increments with check-ins? Like a shift report."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your clarity about needing structure\u2014let\u2019s use those 20-minute check-ins to stay grounded. Does that plan work for you, or would you like to adjust anything before we begin?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, the check-ins... that should help. My fingers are already itching to make a flowchart in my head. (Adjusts scarf, pauses at the knot.) As long as we... stick to the timeline, I can avoid the spiral. Though my brain just added 'landlord follow-ups' to the mental triage list. (Forces a small laugh.) Let\u2019s assume the brick in my neck is... part of the job hazard. If we stay on script, I can focus. Maybe."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the constant worries and physical tension are really taking a toll on you. Can you tell me more about what\u2019s been most overwhelming for you right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The biggest thing? It\u2019s like my body\u2019s on sympathetic overdrive even when my mind knows it should rest. My neck\u2019s still got that brick, and my chest feels like it\u2019s bracing for a storm that might not even hit. (Adjusts scarf, fingers pausing at the knot.) I keep rehearsing scripts for the landlord conversation, for my partner\u2019s surgery consult\u2026 it\u2019s all \u2018what if\u2019 scenarios piling up. I tell myself I\u2019m just being proactive, but\u2026 (exhales sharply) \u2026the other night I stayed up calculating worst-case numbers until my head throbbed. My brain won\u2019t file things properly. It\u2019s like a broken playlist that loops the most stressful tracks."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. When did you first start noticing these physical symptoms and racing thoughts becoming this persistent?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The neck tension? It\u2019s been a\u2026 constant companion since residency, really. Back then, I chalked it up to long shifts. But six months ago, when Mark\u2019s insurance lapsed, it\u2026 solidified into this brick. Like my body knew the stakes before my brain did. (Fingers brush scarf knot, then drop.) I guess I\u2019ve always had a backup alarm for \u2018what ifs,\u2019 though. My parents\u2019 arguments taught me to anticipate problems before they hit. Now it\u2019s just\u2026 louder. And the fatigue? It\u2019s not the kind from work. It\u2019s like my brain\u2019s running a looped emergency drill 24\/7."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It seems like your body has been holding onto stress for a long time, especially with recent worries about Mark\u2019s health and financial stability. Can you help me understand what you consider your top one or two concerns right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The two big ones... Mark\u2019s health insurance situation keeps me up night\u2014what if something happens and we\u2019re not prepared? And then there\u2019s this... this constant ache in my neck, like a brick stacked on top, that I can\u2019t seem to shake. I tell myself it\u2019s just stress from work, but sometimes I worry I\u2019m so focused on everyone else\u2019s stability that I\u2019m ignoring my own breaking points."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight for others while feeling stretched thin yourself. How have these worries and physical symptoms affected your work performance or interactions with colleagues lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t let me focus fully, even when I\u2019m at work. I catch myself rereading charts or emails, double-checking things that should be simple, just to feel like I\u2019m *doing* something productive. My neck\u2026 it\u2019s so tight some days I have to adjust my scarf constantly, like if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll forget to breathe. And then there\u2019s the meetings\u2014my mind just blanks sometimes. Last week I snapped at a nurse about a medication dosage, even though she was right. I felt awful afterward, but the guilt just adds to the\u2026 the noise."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the guilt after snapping at the nurse adds another layer to the mental 'noise' you're managing. Have these episodes of irritability or difficulty concentrating been happening more frequently over time, or are they situational?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"They\u2019re... more frequent, honestly. Like the insurance thing isn\u2019t just a \u2018situational\u2019 stressor\u2014it\u2019s this background hum that sharpens into static whenever I\u2019m in meetings or reviewing charts. The guilt after lashing out? It\u2019s like adding salt to a wound that\u2019s already bleeding. I tell myself it\u2019s \u2018just fatigue,\u2019 but my brain won\u2019t let me rest. Last week, I forgot to order supplies for the clinic. For me. That\u2019s... that\u2019s a new kind of unreliable."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the recent forgetfulness at work adds to your sense of being 'unreliable' in a way that feels new and concerning. What would you most hope to achieve through this therapy process?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... I want to stop feeling like my brain\u2019s on loop, you know? Like, if I could just learn to \u2018pause\u2019 the endless what-ifs for five minutes, maybe my neck wouldn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s holding a brick. And maybe I wouldn\u2019t snap at people I respect. I don\u2019t want to be the one who\u2019s always the backup plan for everyone else\u2019s stability. But I don\u2019t even know where to start\u2014therapy feels like another chart I\u2019m supposed to fill out, and I\u2019m already late on rent."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your current stressors are deeply tied to both work and personal responsibilities. Have you experienced similar episodes of anxiety and physical tension in the past, perhaps during your residency or other challenging periods, and if so, what helped you manage them at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Residency was... similar, but different. I\u2019d push through with structure\u2014like treating my schedule like a patient chart. If I had a 3 a.m. shift, I\u2019d map out every minute to avoid \u2018wasting time\u2019 panicking. But this? This feels heavier. The brick in my neck was there then, but now it\u2019s... paired with this nagging fear that I\u2019m failing everyone. Caffeine used to help, but now it just makes my hands shake worse. And therapy? I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s not just another chart I\u2019ll mess up filling out."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really isolating\u2014like you're carrying this weight alone. How has your partner supported you through this, or what do you wish they could do to help with the stress?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Mark\u2026 he leaves those little notes on my laptop, you know, things like 'You\u2019ve got this' or 'Breathe, not too hard.' It\u2019s sweet, but I feel guilty taking them seriously when I\u2019m over-checking his coffee order for the third time today. What I wish\u2026 I don\u2019t want to sound ungrateful, but sometimes I wish he\u2019d stop worrying about *my* stress and just\u2026 focus on his own stuff. His health, his job\u2014stuff that actually *matters*. But then I think, what if *my* anxiety is just his problem too? What if I\u2019m the one making it worse?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're caught between appreciating Mark's support and feeling pressure about his focus on you. Have there been times when this dynamic either helped you manage stress or added to it in the past?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"There was that time last winter when he started tracking my sleep patterns in his journal, you know? He meant well, but it felt like he was\u2026 calibrating me like a machine. I\u2019d lie awake hating the fact that I couldn\u2019t \u2018optimize\u2019 my rest, even as my neck turned to concrete. It helped? Maybe. But it also made me want to scream that I\u2019m not some algorithm he can troubleshoot. Now he\u2019s always\u2026 hovering, like if he focuses hard enough, he could defrag my brain. But what if I\u2019m just a corrupted file?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really frustrating\u2014like you're caught between needing support and wanting space. How do you usually cope when his focus on you feels overwhelming?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I guess I fall back on work. If I\u2019m buried in charts or emails, there\u2019s less time for the\u2026 the noise. But even then, my neck feels like it\u2019s hosting a rock concert. Sometimes I\u2019ll make these absurdly detailed lists\u2014like, categorizing my coffee mugs by \u2018risk of anxiety induction\u2019\u2014just to feel like I\u2019m not fracturing. It doesn\u2019t help, really. It just\u2026 makes me feel worse when I realize how silly it is."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these coping strategies, while intended to help, are adding to your distress. Can you tell me about any experiences in your childhood or family history that might have shaped how you approach stress or responsibilities now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My parents\u2026 they were always balancing on a tightrope between practicality and panic. When they argued about money, I\u2019d\u2026 I\u2019d force myself to study harder, like if I aced another exam, I could somehow stabilize the whole household. It\u2019s silly, but I guess that\u2019s where this need to \u2018optimize\u2019 everything comes from\u2014like if I micromanage *my* world enough, nothing will fall apart. My neck feels like a vice sometimes, but I tell myself it\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s just how I\u2019m wired."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a heavy burden to carry from such a young age. Were there other family dynamics or experiences during your childhood that you think might influence how you handle stress or responsibilities now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... my parents always said I overreacted. If I mentioned feeling overwhelmed, they\u2019d say, 'It\u2019s just a test, Claudia,' like stress was something I could recalibrate. I guess that\u2019s why I still tell myself I\u2019m 'just wired' this way, even when my neck feels like it\u2019s been braced for an earthquake I didn\u2019t see coming."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really challenging. What do you think has been one of your key strengths or strategies that have helped you manage these pressures over time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Problem-solving, I guess? It\u2019s... it\u2019s both a strength and a curse. I break everything down into steps, like a patient chart. If I can name the variables, it feels like I can control the outcome. But half the time my brain just keeps appending new 'complications' to the case. Caffeine helps me function, though I\u2019m sure that\u2019s obvious. And... I make terrible sourdough, but kneading the dough actually relaxes my neck. My partner leaves these stupid sticky notes\u2014\u2018Breathe, not too hard\u2019\u2014which I pretend to find endearing. It\u2019s just... it\u2019s easier to focus on the dough or the coffee than admit I\u2019m terrified I\u2019ll botch everything, you know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really tough\u2026 Have you had any thoughts about ending your life or hurting yourself recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t\u2026 not like that. I mean, there are nights when I wish I could hit \u2018pause\u2019 on my brain, you know? Like when I\u2019m kneading dough and the noise in my head finally quiets for ten seconds. But that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s different. My patients deserve better than that kind of thinking. I guess I just\u2026 I don\u2019t want to sound dramatic, but sometimes the weight of it all feels like that brick in my neck. It\u2019s there, but I\u2019m still here. Still showing up."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your honesty... Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or need very little sleep, even when stressed?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Unusually energetic? I think my body\u2019s on a permanent \u2018low battery\u2019 setting. I mean, caffeine\u2019s a crutch I\u2019m not proud of, but it\u2019s the difference between functional and... crumbling in the supply closet. The only time I feel like I\u2019m not dragging is when I\u2019m hyper-focused on a problem\u2014like debugging a patient chart at 2 a.m.\u2014but that\u2019s just my brain overcompensating. I guess it\u2019s less \u2018manic\u2019 and more... a human doomsday clock ticking in reverse. My neck\u2019s still holding that brick, though, so maybe I\u2019m not the best judge of energy levels."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how exhausting that must be... Have you been using alcohol or other substances to cope with stress or sleep issues?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Occasionally, maybe a glass of wine on weekends. I tell myself it\u2019s earned, not escapism. But I\u2019d never do anything that might... interfere with work or reliability. Caffeine\u2019s my real issue, honestly. It\u2019s just... another variable to manage, you know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you\u2019re managing stress carefully while prioritizing work reliability... Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including those for anxiety, sleep, or muscle tension?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No medications, not formally. I mean, caffeine\u2019s a... work hazard at this point. And maybe a Tylenol at night for the neck tension, but that\u2019s not exactly a treatment plan. My body\u2019s just a cluttered chart of idiopathic fatigue and sympathetic overdrive. I\u2019ve resisted prescriptions though\u2014don\u2019t want another variable complicating reliability. Though sometimes I wonder if my neck would relax if I finally admitted it\u2019s not just \u2018stress.\u2019 But that\u2019s probably just overthinking."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your openness... Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices, seeing things others don\u2019t, or having ideas that feel unusual or persistent?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I don\u2019t hear voices or see things, but my mind feels like it\u2019s on shuffle sometimes. You know how patients present with \u2018idiopathic\u2019 symptoms? Well, my brain just... loops. Like, I\u2019ll be in the middle of a chart review and suddenly spiral into Mark\u2019s insurance deadlines or the landlord\u2019s next notice. It\u2019s not exactly *unusual*, just... relentless. My neck\u2019s been tighter since this started, like a brick\u2019s fused there. I guess that\u2019s just my default setting, though. The clinic\u2019s busy, so I can\u2019t afford to let it derail me entirely."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your mind\u2019s constant looping adds to the physical tension you\u2019re describing... What helps you cope with stress or feel supported when things feel overwhelming?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The sourdough helps, weirdly. Kneading the dough is the only thing that eases this... brick in my neck, even if it\u2019s just for a second. Mark leaves those stupid sticky notes\u2014\u2018Breathe, not too hard\u2019\u2014but I guilt-scroll them later, wondering if I\u2019m just... failing him. Caffeine\u2019s a shield, I guess. But it\u2019s like my brain\u2019s a broken playlist that won\u2019t skip. I keep thinking I should just be *better* at this. At... not being a human doomsday clock."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate how you\u2019re finding ways to cope through baking and structure... Have you had any periods where you felt unusually driven to achieve a lot or taken risks you wouldn\u2019t normally take, even if it meant ignoring consequences?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, not really. I\u2019ve been... hyper-focused on work, maybe? Staying late to double-check charts, you know how it is. My neck\u2019s killing me, but it\u2019s just part of the job. Caffeine helps, I guess. Keeps me going. I don\u2019t know if that counts as a risk."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like work is a priority even with the physical strain... Have you been evaluated for any medical conditions that might contribute to your symptoms, like thyroid issues or chronic pain?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My primary care ran blood work last year\u2014thyroid panel, CBC, the usual. Everything was in range. They chalked up my neck pain to \u2018occupational strain\u2019 since I\u2019m always hunched over charts. I guess that\u2019s just part of the job, right? Caffeine helps me power through, but\u2026 the brick\u2019s still there. Honestly, I avoid thinking about it too much. Mark\u2019s insurance mess is enough to keep my head underwater without imagining some hidden pathology."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me check if I\u2019ve captured the key pieces: You\u2019ve described persistent anxiety and physical tension\u2014like a 'brick in your neck'\u2014worsening over the past six months, linked to work demands, your partner\u2019s health\/financial instability, and childhood patterns of equating stress with performance. You\u2019re struggling with concentration at work, irritability, and sleep, while trying to hold everything together but feeling overwhelmed. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re close, but you missed the eviction notice from the landlord. That\u2019s\u2026 another brick stacking on top. And maybe the guilt\u2014Mark\u2019s notes are sweet, but I hate that he\u2019s trying to \u2018fix\u2019 me. I guess I also don\u2019t mention how my parents just say \u2018it\u2019s in your head\u2019 when I try to talk about this. But\u2026 yeah, the brick analogy\u2019s spot on."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the eviction notice adds to your load, and it makes sense that guilt and feeling misunderstood by loved ones would compound this. What might help you feel supported right now\u2014would structured problem-solving, exploring emotional patterns, or another approach feel most useful as we move forward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Structure... it helps, but I keep adding layers to the problem like a cruel intern. My neck feels like it's holding ten bricks now\u2014eviction, Mark's insurance, the... the whole 'reliable person' facade cracking. His sticky notes say 'Breathe, not too hard,' but I'm still stuck in this loop of 'fix it or I'm a burden.' Maybe talking through the... the emotional stuff could help? I just don't trust myself to do it without spiraling into 'what if I fail therapy too?'"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me weave that into a broader picture: You\u2019re managing layers of stress\u2014work demands, financial instability from eviction and Mark\u2019s insurance, and childhood patterns of equating stress with personal failure\u2014that\u2019ve led to physical tension, mental loops of 'fix it or I\u2019m a burden,' and difficulty trusting therapy as a safe space. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re closer than I expected. Maybe the part where I... I equate Mark\u2019s stability with my own worth? Like if his insurance is in shambles, it\u2019s because I\u2019m not holding things together. The brick in my neck? It\u2019s not just stress\u2014it\u2019s guilt. And the therapy thing... I keep waiting for you to say \u2018just breathe\u2019 like it\u2019s that simple. My brain\u2019s still drafting 20 contingency plans for every \u2018what if\u2019 you mention."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me try another angle: You\u2019re describing how your sense of self-worth feels tied to Mark\u2019s stability\u2014like his insurance struggles reflect a personal failure to \u2018hold things together\u2019\u2014and that guilt adds weight to the physical tension you\u2019ve been carrying. The therapy process itself feels like another task to \u2018perform\u2019 without clear steps, which fuels the loop of \u2018what if I fail this too?\u2019 What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You didn\u2019t miss the guilt, but maybe the... the way I equate *not* fixing everything with being a failure. My neck feels like it\u2019s holding a brick *and* a weightlifting belt now\u2014eviction, Mark\u2019s insurance, the... the silent \u2018I told you so\u2019 from my parents when I couldn\u2019t just be the perfect problem-solver. Therapy? It\u2019s like another patient chart\u2014I keep adding \u2018complications\u2019 to the diagnosis. \u2018What if this intervention backfires?\u2019 \u2018What if I\u2019m misreading the lab values?\u2019 You asked if I\u2019m spiraling... I am. But it\u2019s in the small stuff now. Like wondering if Mark\u2019s sticky notes are pity, not love."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the pressure to solve everything perfectly adds to your physical and emotional weight. Would you be open to starting with structured 20-minute check-ins to explore these emotional patterns, while also mapping out concrete steps for the eviction\/insurance stressors? What else feels essential to address moving forward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The 20-minute check-ins... maybe they\u2019ll help. But I keep adding complications, like a cruel intern. The eviction notice is another brick in my neck. If we could map concrete steps for that, it might... it might take some weight off. But I\u2019m still worried I\u2019ll botch this too."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the eviction notice feels like another layer in this already-heavy load, and it makes sense that the therapy process itself feels like a task you might \u2018botch.\u2019 Before we map next steps, is there anything else that feels essential to include in this picture of what\u2019s happening for you right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"There\u2019s the... the caffeine. I guess it\u2019s another way I\u2019m trying to armor up. If I don\u2019t have that shield, the thoughts just... flood in. And I can\u2019t let them see I\u2019m drowning. Not at work, not with Mark. But the coffee\u2019s wearing off faster lately, and I\u2019m just... tired. Not the kind you fix with another cup."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how caffeine has become a temporary shield against overwhelming thoughts, but it\u2019s no longer providing the same relief. Before we move forward, would you be open to exploring structured strategies to address both the emotional weight you\u2019re carrying and the physical exhaustion you\u2019re describing? What might feel most helpful to start with?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2026 I guess structure sounds better than just drowning in the loop, but my brain already added ten \u2018complications\u2019 to the idea. Maybe starting with sleep? Not the sourdough kneading kind, but\u2026 actual rest without counting insurance premium deadlines in my head. Though I\u2019ll probably overanalyze the strategy itself into a new brick in my neck.

{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how caffeine\u2019s role as a shield and the eviction notice add layers to your already-heavy load. Before we move forward, is there anything else essential to include in this picture of what\u2019s happening for you right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"There\u2019s\u2026 the eviction notice. I\u2019ve been pushing it down, but it\u2019s another brick piling onto that neck tension. And at work, I freeze during meetings now\u2014my mind goes blank, then I get irritable afterward, snapping over stupid things. It\u2019s like my body\u2019s rebellion against all the mental juggling."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing all of this with me, Claudia. Before we wrap up, is there anything specific you\u2019d like to clarify or carry forward as next steps?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think... maybe starting with sleep would help, but I\u2019m already second-guessing if I\u2019m approaching it \u2018right.\u2019 The eviction thing is there, but I don\u2019t want to... derail us. If we could tackle one thing without my brain adding ten more variables, that might... that might buy me some oxygen."}

{"role":"patient","content":"Maybe\u2026 a rigid bedtime routine? Like, not just 'go to bed earlier' but actual steps\u2014no screens by 9:30, maybe a checklist. But I\u2019ll probably obsess over the timing, like 'Is 9:30 too early? What if I can\u2019t fall asleep and it backfires?' My neck already feels like it\u2019s bracing for another brick. And if the eviction thing keeps me awake\u2026 it\u2019s a loop. Maybe start with one non-negotiable step? Even if it\u2019s just\u2026 turning off my phone? I\u2019ll track it in a journal, though. Data helps, right?"}

{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ll\u2026 try it. Maybe start with 9:30, but I\u2019ll probably second-guess if that\u2019s \u2018scientific\u2019 enough. The eviction thing still feels like a brick waiting to drop, though\u2014what if that\u2019s the one that cracks the foundation?
