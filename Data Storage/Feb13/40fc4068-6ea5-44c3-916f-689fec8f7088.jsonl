{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hello, Sarah. My name is Jesse Matthews, and I\u2019ll be conducting this interview with you today. To start, is \u2018Sarah\u2019 the name you\u2019d prefer, and are there any pronouns you\u2019d like me to use? Once we have that settled, I\u2019ll briefly explain what to expect from today\u2019s session and check if you\u2019re comfortable proceeding."}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, Sarah McKinney. She\/her, please. Look, I suppose I should explain I\u2019m a bit\u2026 restless today. My clinic had a complicated differential last week\u2014you know, the kind that keeps you up recalculating dosages? It\u2019s nothing, really. I just need to\u2026 check the lab results one more time. Would you like me to sign the consent form before we begin?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really tough... Are you comfortable proceeding with today\u2019s session?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, I suppose so. It\u2019s just\u2026 the lab results, you know? I need to verify them again. If I can just focus on that, I think I\u2019ll be alright. The differential was so complex\u2014still is, honestly."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really tough... Before we move forward, do you have any questions about what today\u2019s session will involve?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I think... everything\u2019s covered in the consent form. Just, you know, the usual protocol. I\u2019ll need to double-check the lab results later, though. My hands are a bit tense\u2014should I... loosen my collar? Helps me focus."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Can you tell me more about the concerns that have been most troubling for you lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s\u2026 the usual, I suppose. My clinic\u2019s been swamped with these complicated differentials\u2014lab results that demand precision, you know? I find myself\u2026 checking them repeatedly, just to be sure. And then there\u2019s my husband\u2019s brother in hospice. It\u2019s not my place to dwell on it, but I can\u2019t stop overprocessing everything. My hands are always clenched, even when I\u2019m trying to sleep. I wake up exhausted, like my brain\u2019s been running calculations all night. Do you think the lab results might take long to finalize?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the hospice situation adds to your stress even though you feel it's not your place to dwell on it. When did you first start noticing these worries affecting your daily life?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose it's... you know, it's hard to pinpoint exactly. I've always been meticulous, right? But lately, even routine things\u2014like verifying lab decimals\u2014feel like landmines. The hospice... it's new stress, but the worrying? That's been there forever. You know, like my mother taught me to check every red pen mark... even in margins. I catch myself redoing tasks at work just to... I don't know, quiet the loop? My hands are always clenched at night, trying to 'unworry' but it never sticks."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure to be perfect has been a long-standing part of your life, and the hospice situation added new stress. When did you first notice this combination making things harder for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think it's... the past few months, really. The hospice situation has just made the usual... the usual hyper-checking feel even more necessary. I find myself redoing things at work, like lab results, even when I know I've done them right. And my hands\u2014my hands are always clenched, even when I'm trying to sleep. It's like my body can't... relax, you know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your body\u2019s tension and need to control details have become overwhelming. Can you share an example of how this has affected your interactions with your husband recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ve been... short with him sometimes. You know, when he tries to talk about the hospice, I get... I suppose I shut down. My hands clench, and I just start talking about work\u2014labs, dosages, anything to steer clear. He doesn\u2019t push, which I appreciate, but it\u2019s like I\u2019m failing both of us. I mean, he\u2019s the one holding it all together, and I\u2019m just... here, you know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to manage everything perfectly, which must be exhausting. What are you hoping to achieve through this process?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose... I just want to stop feeling so keyed up all the time. You know, my hands are always clenched, even when I try to sleep. If I could, I guess I\u2019d like to trust that I\u2019m not going to miss a decimal point in a lab result, that I can... relax enough to let the day unfold without checking everything three times. But I don\u2019t know. It feels like if I let my guard down, something will go wrong."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like this pattern of worry has been building for some time. Have you experienced similar episodes of worry or anxiety in the past, and if so, what helped you manage them?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"In the past, I\u2019d... I suppose I\u2019d throw myself into work, you know? Like if I focused harder on the labs, the rest would... settle. But now, even that doesn\u2019t quiet it. My hands are still clenched at night, even after a long day. I try the wine, but it\u2019s just... a glass that sits there. Doesn\u2019t really help."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Have you used any other substances besides alcohol, such as cannabis, prescription medications, or stimulants, in the past year?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, not really... I mean, nothing prescription. Maybe some antacids, you know? For the stomach stuff when work\u2019s busy. But that\u2019s it, honestly. (Fidgets with hands, knuckles whitening slightly.) I suppose I could use a sleeping pill sometimes, but I\u2014 I don\u2019t like relying on things. It\u2019s just\u2026 the labs, the hospice calls, the what-ifs. They keep me up. (Voice cracks imperceptibly.) My husband says I\u2019m overthinking, but how can I not?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how overwhelming it feels to carry all that weight. How has your alcohol use been in the past year\u2014has it changed from what you described earlier?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s... pretty much the same, I suppose. One glass most nights, just to unwind. But lately, even that feels like it\u2019s not enough. The labs, the hospice calls\u2014they keep me wired. (Pauses, fingers tapping the armrest.) I know I should probably cut back, but how do you choose between that and... (gestures vaguely) everything else? My hands shake if I skip it now. (Forces a tight smile.) You understand, right? It\u2019s just... management."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the stress from work and personal responsibilities is really taking a toll. Can you tell me about any medications or supplements you're currently taking, including over-the-counter ones like antacids or sleeping pills?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The antacids, yes\u2014I take those when the stomach\u2026 tightens up, you know? And maybe a sleeping pill occasionally, though I hate feeling like I need it. (Kneads her temples.) My husband says I overdo it, but how else do I quiet the\u2026 the what-ifs? They\u2019re always there, even when I\u2019m trying to rest. (Forces a dry laugh.) It\u2019s just management, right? You understand that part, don\u2019t you?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure is really weighing on you... Have you had any thoughts about ending your life or harming yourself recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t\u2026 I mean, not like that. (Pauses, fingers digging into the armrest.) But sometimes when I\u2019m up at 2 a.m. checking lab results again, the weight of it all\u2026 (Swallowing hard.) It\u2019s the what-ifs that wear you down, you know? Not the big things, just\u2026 the endless decimal points. (Forces a brittle laugh.) My husband says I\u2019m a doctor, not a suicide. He\u2019s probably right."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how the pressure of your responsibilities is really weighing on you. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns lately\u2014like feeling unusually energetic or needing less sleep than usual?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Energy? I suppose not as much as I used to. My shoulders are always\u2026 clenched, you know? Like they\u2019re holding the weight of every decimal point. Sleep\u2014well, I\u2019m up at 2 a.m. rechecking lab results again. (Forces a tight smile.) My husband says I\u2019m \u2018addicted to insomnia,\u2019 but how else do you manage\u2026 everything? (Fidgets, hands trembling slightly.) The pills help sometimes, but not enough. You understand, right?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your mind rarely slows down, even when you're trying to rest. Have you experienced periods where you felt unusually energetic or had a decreased need for sleep, even when you were tired?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose... I\u2019ve been at the office late, you know? Double-checking lab results, recalculating dosages. But it\u2019s just part of the job, right? My husband says I\u2019m \u2018addicted to insomnia\u2019\u2014laughs like it\u2019s a joke\u2014but my hands\u2026 they\u2019re always clenched, even when I try to sleep. I\u2019ll lie there, mentally revising a patient\u2019s chart instead of\u2026 counting sheep. But I\u2019m exhausted, obviously. You can\u2019t function on three hours a night, even if you tell yourself it\u2019s \u2018efficiency.\u2019"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your mind rarely slows down, even when you're trying to rest. Have you noticed any unusual thoughts, sensations, or beliefs lately\u2014like hearing voices, seeing things others don\u2019t, or feeling strongly that something unusual is happening around you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Unusual thoughts? I suppose not\u2026 just the usual storm of decimals and \u2018what ifs.\u2019 You know, my mind\u2019s hyper, but it\u2019s always been this way. My hands\u2026 they tremble when I try to explain it all. No, nothing *strange*\u2014just the same loops about lab results, hospice calls\u2026 the usual. My husband jokes I\u2019m \u2018addicted to stress,\u2019 but it\u2019s not like I can just\u2026 turn it off."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It seems the pressure of your responsibilities is really wearing on you... Have you experienced any periods in the past where you felt unusually energetic or needed significantly less sleep, even when you were tired?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Unusual energy? No, I\u2019m just\u2026 exhausted. You know, the lab checks, hospice calls\u2014it\u2019s all so draining. My hands\u2026 they\u2019re always trembling, even when I try to rest. I\u2019m not sleeping well, but it\u2019s not like I have the energy to do anything but\u2026 keep checking."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds incredibly draining to carry that weight constantly. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, like feeling more irritable or restless than usual, even when trying to rest?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose\u2026 I\u2019ve been shorter with people lately. You know, the nurses in the clinic, my husband\u2014little things set me off. My hands\u2026 they won\u2019t stop fidgeting, even when I\u2019m trying to focus. I\u2019ll start counting decimal points in a lab report just to\u2026 calm down. But it\u2019s exhausting. I feel like I\u2019m one missed call away from losing it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds incredibly draining to carry that weight constantly. Have you experienced any periods where you felt you didn\u2019t need as much sleep as usual, even when you were tired?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose\u2026 no, I\u2019ve never felt like I *needed* less sleep. It\u2019s more like I can\u2019t shut off the mental noise. You know, the lab results, hospice calls\u2014they follow me into bed. My hands\u2026 they\u2019re always twitching even when I\u2019m trying to rest. I\u2019ll lie there recalculating dosages at 2 a.m. until my eyes burn, but it\u2019s not like I *want* to stay up. My body\u2019s just\u2026 stuck on overload. My husband jokes I\u2019m \u2018addicted to stress,\u2019 but that\u2019s about it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your mind rarely slows down, even when you're trying to rest. Have you noticed any changes in your thoughts, like hearing voices, seeing things others don\u2019t, or feeling strongly that something unusual is happening around you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, nothing like that. It\u2019s more... my mind just races, you know? I\u2019ll be going over lab results in my head at night, and my hands... they tremble even when I\u2019m trying to rest. My husband says I\u2019m too hard on myself, but work demands it, you know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your mind rarely slows down, even when you're trying to rest. Have you had any medical conditions or issues in the past that might be related to your current symptoms, such as thyroid problems, chronic pain, or sleep apnea?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose... my thyroid was checked a few years back. They said it was normal. I take antacids sometimes, but that\u2019s just stress, right? You know, the pills the hospital gave me after the hospice calls started... well, I maybe still have a few left. But it\u2019s the checking, the rechecking\u2014that\u2019s the real problem, not some test result."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like managing your symptoms with what\u2019s available has been challenging. Can you list all the medications or supplements you\u2019re currently taking, including over-the-counter items like antacids or sleeping pills?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose... antacids, yes, and there are a few sleeping pills left from the hospital. They said my thyroid was fine last time. It\u2019s just... the checking, the rechecking\u2014that\u2019s the real issue, not the pills. I\u2019ve been trying to cut back, but it\u2019s hard when the numbers won\u2019t stop swirling."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure of your responsibilities is really wearing on you... Have you experienced any periods in the past where you felt unusually energetic or needed significantly less sleep, even when you were tired?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose... no. I\u2019m always tired, really. The hospice calls, the labs... they keep me up. My husband jokes I\u2019m addicted to stress, but it\u2019s just the checking, you know? My hands still tremble when I try to fall asleep. There\u2019s no energy\u2014just... the same storm."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Sarah, based on our conversation, it sounds like your anxiety has been building for years, worsened recently by the stress of hospice care for your husband\u2019s brother and high-pressure work demands. You\u2019ve managed it by overworking and checking details, but now you\u2019re exhausted, irritable, and struggling to sleep, which is affecting your relationships and medical work. The formulation we\u2019re considering includes longstanding perfectionism, recent stressors, and coping patterns that now feel overwhelming. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re not wrong, but you missed the... the decimal points, I guess? How I\u2019ll lie awake at night rewriting patient charts in my head because what if a misplaced comma costs someone their life? And the hospice\u2014it\u2019s not just the calls. My husband\u2019s brother\u2019s chart is in my head too, you know? I keep recalculating his survival odds like it\u2019s a differential I can solve. The pills help, but they\u2019re just... antacids for the anxiety. The real problem is the loop. It never ends."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure to avoid even minor errors in patient care, along with the emotional weight of the hospice case, adds a layer of anxiety that\u2019s hard to break free from. What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think what\u2019s\u2026 I suppose it\u2019s the way my mind just loops, you know? Even when I\u2019m trying to rest, I catch myself rechecking medication doses in my head. My hands are always clenched at night\u2014my husband jokes I\u2019m \u2018training them for a vice grip.\u2019 And the wine\u2026 well, it\u2019s not really a vice, just\u2026 something to dull the edge of the decimal points, I guess. You know how it is."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Sarah, based on our conversation, it sounds like your anxiety is tied to perfectionism and hypervigilance in your work, worsened by the emotional weight of your husband\u2019s brother\u2019s hospice care. You describe mental loops over patient details, physical tension at night, and using wine to cope. The formulation includes longstanding perfectionism, recent stressors, and coping patterns that now feel unmanageable. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think you\u2019re\u2026 I suppose you\u2019re right about most of it. What I maybe didn\u2019t say enough is how my body\u2019s always tight, even during the day. My shoulders feel like concrete by noon, and my hands\u2026 they shake when I write prescriptions. It\u2019s not just the labs at night\u2014it\u2019s like my whole body\u2019s stuck in overdrive. And the wine? It just\u2026 it numbs the edge but not the loop. The loop\u2019s always there."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the physical tension and shaking are adding to the emotional weight you\u2019re carrying, especially with the demands of your work. What did I miss in summarizing how these layers interact?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think you\u2019re right about the body tension feeding into it all... My legs feel like they\u2019re made of coiled wire by the end of the day\u2014it\u2019s not just my hands. The hospice calls? They\u2019re like... a constant hum in the background, making every decimal point feel like a cliffhanger. The wine helps me fall asleep, but the loop just restarts at 2 a.m. with the same questions. I suppose... I\u2019ve become a walking paradox of \u2018I\u2019m fine\u2019 and \u2018what if I\u2019m not.\u2019"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Sarah, based on our conversation, it sounds like your anxiety is tied to physical tension (legs feeling coiled, hands shaking), the emotional weight of hospice care, and mental loops over work details that restart at night despite wine. You\u2019ve described feeling trapped between \u2018I\u2019m fine\u2019 and fear of failing yourself or others. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think you\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re not wrong, but maybe you missed how the tension isn\u2019t just in my body\u2014it\u2019s in my *thinking*, you know? Like, even when I\u2019m at the clinic, I\u2019ll catch myself double-checking a blood pressure reading and realize I\u2019ve been holding my breath for three minutes. The hospice calls\u2026 they\u2019re not just a hum. They\u2019re like a second shift I can\u2019t clock out of. And the wine\u2014well, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s useless, it\u2019s just\u2026 it lets me sleep, but the loop\u2019s still there, whispering. I suppose what\u2019s worst is how I convince myself I\u2019m \u2018handling it\u2019 until my hands start trembling over a patient\u2019s chart. Then I have to pretend I\u2019m just\u2026 you know\u2026 precise."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Sarah, you\u2019ve described how your anxiety is deeply tied to mental loops over work details, physical tension that doesn\u2019t relax even at rest, and a sense of being trapped between \u2018I\u2019m fine\u2019 and fear of failing yourself or others. What would help you feel more supported in breaking free from this cycle?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose\u2026 if there was a way to\u2026 I don\u2019t know, *pause*\u2026 have someone else double-check the decimals for me? Just so I could stop\u2026 holding my breath every time. And maybe\u2026 you know\u2026 if the hospice calls didn\u2019t feel like they were happening *through* me, like I had to solve everyone\u2019s grief at the same time as their lab results. But that sounds selfish. What helps most is when my husband says, \u2018The charts can wait,\u2019 even though I hate letting them sit. My hands still shake over the pen, though\u2026 you know how it is."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the weight of holding everything together\u2014both the decimal points and the emotional burden of hospice\u2014has become unsustainable, even with your husband\u2019s support. What did I miss in summarizing how these layers contribute to the cycle you\u2019re describing?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s\u2026 the way the hospice calls bleed into my work hours, you know? I\u2019ll be charting a patient\u2019s blood pressure and suddenly fixate on whether the nurse called about Mr. Thompson\u2019s morphine dose last night. My hands clench so hard I think I\u2019ll snap the pen\u2026 then I have to double-check *everything* just to shake the knot in my shoulders. And the antacids\u2014my husband jokes I\u2019m addicted to them, but it\u2019s the loops, right? What if I missed a symptom? What if\u2026 it\u2019s all just\u2026 tangled."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Sarah, based on our conversation, it sounds like the hospice calls are creating a relentless backdrop that intrudes on your work focus, fueling loops of overchecking and physical tension. You\u2019ve described a cycle where even small tasks feel high-stakes, and coping strategies like wine or antacids offer only fleeting relief. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s the way\u2026 the way my hands can\u2019t stop trembling even when I\u2019m trying to focus. You know? Like, even when I\u2019m at home, my fingers are always\u2026 clenched. And the antacids\u2014my husband\u2019s right, I probably take them too much, but what else am I supposed to do when the loops won\u2019t stop? It\u2019s like\u2026 like the hospice calls and the lab results are both screaming for attention, and I\u2019m just\u2026 trying to keep up without missing a decimal point. Even when I know I\u2019m overdoing it, I can\u2019t stop. You know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Sarah, based on our conversation, it sounds like your anxiety is deeply intertwined with physical tension (clenched hands, trembling), mental loops over work details, and the emotional weight of hospice care\u2014creating a cycle where even small tasks feel high-stakes. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose\u2026 you didn\u2019t mention how the weight of it all makes my shoulders ache, like they\u2019re carrying the whole hospital on one side and the hospice files on the other. You know? And the wine\u2014well, it\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s not really a vice, is it? It\u2019s more like a\u2026 a doctor\u2019s right to one thing that doesn\u2019t require double-checking. But you\u2019re right about the loops. I\u2019ll fixate on a lab result at 2 a.m., then snap back to a hospice call and forget my own name for a second. It\u2019s all just\u2026 tangled."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"The weight you\u2019re carrying\u2014both physically and emotionally\u2014sounds incredibly heavy, especially with the overlapping demands of your work and the hospice care. What would you most want to address or change as we think about next steps for support?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose\u2026 I\u2019d want to stop feeling like my hands are always in a vice grip, you know? Even when I\u2019m not at work, they\u2019re clenched. And the loops\u2014what if there\u2019s a way to\u2026 quiet them long enough to actually rest? Not just with wine, but\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I keep thinking if I could just organize the hospice notes better, maybe the rest would untangle. But it\u2019s not like that, is it?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Sarah, based on our conversation, it sounds like your anxiety is deeply connected to physical tension (clenched hands, trembling), mental loops over work and hospice details, and a need to regain control through meticulous organization. What would be most helpful for us to prioritize next\u2014exploring strategies to quiet the mental loops, addressing the physical tension, or another approach?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose\u2026 if there\u2019s a way to loosen the grip on my hands without\u2026 without making me feel like I\u2019m losing control? Because the loops\u2014they just\u2026 they follow the tension, you know? If I could untangle even one thread, maybe the rest would quiet down. But how do you fix something that\u2019s part of the job, part of being a doctor? You can\u2019t just\u2026 stop double-checking, can you?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really challenging\u2014holding so much together while the loops keep tightening. If we were to start untangling one thread, would you prefer to focus first on strategies to ease the physical tension in your hands and body, or on addressing the mental loops around work and hospice details?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose\u2026 if we had to pick, the physical tension is the most obvious thread, you know? My hands are always clenched, even when I\u2019m trying to rest. It\u2019s like my body\u2019s stuck in this\u2026 problem-solving mode. But honestly, the hospice calls and the lab results\u2014they all braid together. I can\u2019t untangle them without feeling like I\u2019m dropping something. Maybe starting with the hands would help me stop checking those decimal points at 2 a.m."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It makes sense to start with what feels most tangible\u2014the clenched hands and body tension. What strategies or support would you most want to explore first to address that physical tightness and its connection to the mental loops?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose\u2026 I\u2019ve tried progressive muscle relaxation before, but it feels like telling a storm to calm down. My hands still clench when I\u2019m on the phone with hospice, you know? Maybe if there was a way to\u2026 untangle the checking from the actual task?
