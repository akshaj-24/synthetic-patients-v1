{"role":"interviewer","content":"May I use your full name, Jennifer Hess, or would you prefer a different name or pronouns?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Jennifer Hess is fine. I... I don\u2019t really think about names much. Just gets the job done, you know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds straightforward. Do you have any questions about how this will work before we move forward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess not. Just... you know, been so long since I\u2019ve talked about much of anything. Sleep\u2019s been... tricky, but I\u2019ll manage. To be honest, I\u2019m more worried about the timing. Got a cousin starting a business next week, and I need to\u2014"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a lot to manage right now. Are you comfortable continuing with the session so we can talk more about what's been going on?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, I guess. Just... this and that. Sleep\u2019s been worse lately. Can\u2019t even finish a book without my eyes closing. But I\u2019ll talk\u2014just don\u2019t mind if I get... scattered. Like trying to nail Jell-O, you know? My cousin\u2019s business thing\u2019s got me distracted, but I\u2019ll... I\u2019ll manage. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got a choice, really."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your sleep issues are really affecting your daily life. Can you tell me when you first noticed your sleep pattern changing, and how it\u2019s been different from your usual routine?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess it started a couple years back, after... well, after everything with the divorce. Used to lay awake counting the clock ticks till three, you know? Now it\u2019s more like I\u2019m just... tired all the time. Can\u2019t even finish weeding the garden without my eyes closing. Feels like I\u2019m trying to nail Jell-O to a wall half the time. My boss\u2019s been giving me the side-eye \u2019bout mistakes piling up, but I\u2019ll straighten it out. Got that cousin\u2019s business launch to focus on, can\u2019t afford to slip up now."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the stress of your cousin's business launch is adding to the challenges you're already facing. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or how you feel emotionally since the divorce?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... it's like trying to pour concrete when the mix is all wrong. Some days I just don't have the strength to hold it together. Sleep's the biggest problem\u2014I'll nod off weeding the garden or watching TV, which is embarrassing as hell. My daughter's been giving me that look, you know? The one that says 'something's off.' I try to brush it off, say I'm just tired from work, but... to be honest, I don't even mind if I don't wake up some nights. It's not that I want it\u2014just feels like my body's running on empty. Speaking of which, my cousin's business launch is a mess\u2014she keeps asking me to help with the website, but I can't even focus on that anymore."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like things have been building up, especially with your cousin's business. Can you tell me about any recent changes or stressors that might be contributing to how you're feeling now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s like... trying to hammer nails into concrete with a screwdriver. The website thing with my cousin\u2019s business is a mess, but the real kicker\u2019s the sleep. I\u2019ll be up at 2 a.m. staring at the ceiling, then crash hard during lunch. My hands shake so bad I spill my coffee\u2014my boss says \u2018again?\u2019 like I\u2019m some kind of liability. To be honest? I don\u2019t care anymore. Just... keep putting one foot in front of the other. My car\u2019s been acting up too, but what\u2019s the point in fixing it? It\u2019s not like I can afford a new one."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight right now. What are you hoping to achieve through coming in for help right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly? I just want to stop feeling like my batteries\u2019re dead before noon. If I could sleep through the night once in a while, maybe I\u2019d have the headspace to actually help my cousin with that website instead of messing it up. And... if I could stop worrying my daughter\u2019s thinking I\u2019m some kind of ghost haunting the kitchen. Doesn\u2019t have to be anything dramatic\u2014just enough to keep showing up, you know? My boss already thinks I\u2019m one mistake away from being fired, and I\u2019m damned if I let that happen."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to 'keep showing up' despite feeling drained. When did you first notice these recent changes in your sleep and energy levels worsening?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s been gradual, really. After the divorce, sleep started slipping like sand through fingers. Used to just be 3 a.m. wake-ups, but now it\u2019s... I\u2019m barely holding it together by noon. My boss says I\u2019m making more mistakes, and I can\u2019t even focus on helping my cousin with her website. Feels like my battery\u2019s just... leaking out."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like this is a really challenging time for you. Have you experienced periods like this before, where you felt this down or had trouble sleeping and focusing?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... this feels different than regular stress. Before, I\u2019d push through pain or money worries\u2014like weathering a storm with a shaky roof. But this? It\u2019s like the foundation\u2019s rotting. Since the divorce, it\u2019s not just tiredness. I can\u2019t even tell if I\u2019m angry or just... empty. Used to power through with coffee and grit, but now? My hands shake even when I\u2019m not holding anything."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s clear the divorce has really shaken your sense of stability. Have you experienced periods like this before, where you felt a similar loss of energy or emotional numbness?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... when the kids were little, it was non-stop hustle. But that was different, y\u2019know? This feels like the foundation\u2019s actually cracking. My hands shake worse now, even when I\u2019m trying to hold a screwdriver. Boss says I\u2019m making more mistakes, but how can I focus when I\u2019m sleeping in 30-minute chunks? The garden\u2019s gone to weeds, but I can\u2019t even bring myself to pull them. It\u2019s not just tired\u2014feels like I\u2019m unraveling at the seams."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really overwhelming to feel like everything's unraveling. Have you had episodes like this before where you felt a similar sense of things falling apart?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, not like this. I\u2019ve had rough patches\u2014long hours, money worries\u2014but this feels different. Like the foundation\u2019s settling unevenly. You can patch a crack, but if the base\u2019s gone\u2026 (trails off, then shifts focus) My cousin\u2019s business, though, that\u2019s a whole different mess. She\u2019s drowning in debt, and now she wants me to invest\u2026"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really heavy to carry. How has this situation with your cousin been affecting your energy or focus lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly? It\u2019s like adding weight to a sagging beam\u2014doesn\u2019t hold anything up, just makes the whole thing creak louder. She\u2019s got me tangled in her numbers now, and my head\u2019s already spinning half the time. (Pauses, rubs temples) My hands shake bad enough I can\u2019t even type straight. Told her no, but she won\u2019t let it go. (Voice tightens) You ever deal with family business stuff? It\u2019s a nightmare you can\u2019t walk away from."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed right now. Have you had any thoughts of not wanting to live or harm yourself at all?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t know... I just get so tired. Sometimes I think maybe a good sleep would help. (sighs) But I don\u2019t want to worry anyone. My hands shake bad enough already. The garden\u2019s a mess, but I can\u2019t even bring myself to fix it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the fatigue is really affecting your daily life. Have you ever had moments where you feel like it wouldn't matter if you didn't wake up from one of those nights?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess if I\u2019m honest, sometimes I think it wouldn\u2019t matter. But I don\u2019t want to worry the kids\u2014my daughter\u2019s got her own head to deal with. (Pauses, rubs palms on thighs) It\u2019s not about wanting out, it\u2019s just\u2026 my body\u2019s a broken clock. If it stops ticking, maybe it\u2019ll all be over. (Quick, defensive chuckle) But I\u2019m not giving up. Just\u2026 tired, you know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a heavy burden to carry... Have you thought about how that might happen\u2014if it did?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess I just... keep putting one foot in front of the other, you know? Like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall. My back\u2019s a wreck, and that damn car\u2019s eating money I don\u2019t got. But what\u2019s the point in thinking about \u2018how\u2019? It is what it is. I\u2019m here, aren\u2019t I?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're carrying a lot of physical and financial strain right now. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or drug use recently, even if small, that might be affecting your energy or focus?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I still have that one glass most nights. Keeps me from thinking too much, I guess. But it\u2019s just... flat, like everything else these days. Can\u2019t even pretend it\u2019s helping like it used to. My daughter\u2019s college apps are due soon\u2014got to get that garden cleared out for her before the interviewers see the mess."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the alcohol isn't providing the relief it once did. Have you been using any other substances besides alcohol, such as cannabis, medications, or something else?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, ma\u2019am. Just that one glass. I\u2019m not... I don\u2019t got the headspace for anything else. My cousin\u2019s website\u2019s got me pulling double shifts, but at least the coffee\u2019s keeping me upright. The garden\u2019s a mess, though\u2014should\u2019ve tilled that soil by now."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your energy levels are really fluctuating. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including things like vitamins or over-the-counter remedies, that might be affecting how you feel?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess I pop a B-complex now and then. They said it might help with the nerves, but... feels like tossing a bandaid at a broken pipe. Coffee\u2019s the real thing keeping me vertical these days. My daughter\u2019s college apps\u2014got to get that garden looking halfway decent before the visitors come. You know how it is."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like caffeine is playing a big role in helping you stay alert. Have you noticed any times when you feel unusually energetic or need very little sleep, even when you're exhausted?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, ma\u2019am. Coffee\u2019s the only thing keeping me vertical, but it\u2019s like a bandaid on a broken pipe\u2014just papering over how dead I am inside. My hands still shake, but I guess that\u2019s just the price of trying to hold it together for the kid\u2019s sake. Speaking of, that garden\u2019s a disaster\u2014should\u2019ve tilled that soil by now."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're putting a lot of effort into managing for your daughter's sake. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like thyroid issues or sleep apnea, that might be contributing to your fatigue or shaking hands?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, they haven\u2019t found anything like that. Doc said it\u2019s \u2018stress-related\u2019\u2014you know how they say everything\u2019s stress these days. My body\u2019s like old machinery, I guess. Sometimes it just\u2026 sputters. But I\u2019m used to it. Keeps me grounded, in a way. Though the garden\u2019s a mess, so maybe I should focus on that instead of\u2026 whatever\u2019s wrong with me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like stress is taking a real toll on you... Have you noticed any strange thoughts, experiences, or feelings lately\u2014like hearing voices, seeing things others don\u2019t, or believing things that seem off to others?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Just... cloudy days, I guess. Like my head\u2019s full of static sometimes. But maybe that\u2019s just me getting older. The garden\u2019s a mess, but at least the weeds grow straight\u2014unlike my thoughts."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That metaphor about static in your thoughts is striking... Have you noticed any experiences where you hear voices, see things others don\u2019t, or hold beliefs that feel different from reality, even if just occasionally?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, nothing like that. I mean, sometimes I get... I don\u2019t know, like my head\u2019s a radio with the wrong station. But that\u2019s just me, I guess. My hands still shake worse in the mornings\u2014doc says it\u2019s stress, so I figure that\u2019s the diagnosis. Speaking of, my cousin\u2019s website project is eating my brain. You ever try to explain HTML to someone who thinks pixels are magic?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your body\u2019s been working overtime to keep up with everything. Have you noticed any other medical issues or symptoms that might be contributing to how you\u2019re feeling, even if they seem unrelated at first?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Nah, doc\u2019s just kept saying stress, you know? My hands still shake worse in the mornings\u2014like they\u2019re rebelling or something. The garden\u2019s a mess, but maybe that\u2019s just me\u2026 letting things go. Speaking of, my cousin\u2019s website project\u2019s turning into a nightmare. You ever try convincing a client that \u2018pixel magic\u2019 isn\u2019t a real thing?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the physical symptoms are adding to your frustration... Have you had any medical tests or evaluations specifically for the shaking in your hands, or do you know if there's a known cause for that?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Tests? Doc just shrugs and says 'stress again.' My hands are like a wobbly workbench\u2014useless when you need \u2019em. But the garden\u2019s really coming along, you know? All that weedy chaos\u2026 it\u2019s a damn HTML maze, actually. You ever try explaining CSS to a client who thinks pixels are sentient?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me recap what we\u2019ve covered: You\u2019ve been feeling persistently down and empty for months, with disrupted sleep, trouble concentrating at work, and withdrawing from relationships after your divorce. These challenges are affecting your job performance and daily energy, and while you\u2019re not planning to give up, you\u2019re noticing passive thoughts about not wanting to wake up some nights. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You got the sleep part right\u2014my head\u2019s a broken clock, but it\u2019s not just the divorce. The hands still shake like I\u2019m made of static, but the doc says it\u2019s stress. I guess that\u2019s it. What\u2019s really gnawing at me is the website my cousin\u2019s pushing me to help with. Feels like I\u2019m trying to build a house on Jell-O."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your current stress around the cousin\u2019s website is adding to the fatigue and instability you\u2019ve already been managing. Let me try to piece this together: Over the past few months, you\u2019ve been struggling with disrupted sleep, low energy, difficulty concentrating at work, and withdrawing from relationships after your divorce. The cousin\u2019s business project feels like another layer of pressure, even though you\u2019re trying to hold things together for your daughter and job. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is all fitting together for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re close, but you\u2019re missing how the shaking hands make the website work feel like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall. My daughter\u2019s college apps are due next month\u2014I keep freezing up when I try to help her edit essays. The doc says it\u2019s stress, but what if it\u2019s something else? I guess I\u2019m just\u2026 tired of pretending I\u2019m not falling apart."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure of supporting your daughter\u2019s college applications is adding to the weight you\u2019re already carrying. What did I miss or get wrong about how all of this is showing up for you right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re not wrong about the pressure, but it\u2019s the shaking hands that make me freeze when I try to help my daughter with her essays. The garden\u2019s overgrown, and I can\u2019t even keep up with the basics anymore. I guess it\u2019s just... I\u2019m trying to hold it together, but it\u2019s like the foundation\u2019s cracking."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the physical symptoms and pressure to support your daughter are making everything feel unstable right now. Let me try to summarize: Over months, you\u2019ve experienced worsening fatigue, hand tremors, and sleep issues that started after your divorce, compounding stress from work, family obligations, and your cousin\u2019s business. These challenges make it hard to focus on tasks like helping your daughter with college essays, and you\u2019re worried about losing your grip. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is all connecting for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re not wrong, but you\u2019re still not seeing how the garden\u2019s rotting like drywall in a flood. The essays\u2026 I can\u2019t hold the words steady. My hands won\u2019t stop shaking, but the doc just says \u2018stress.\u2019 I guess what\u2019s missing is that I\u2019m tired of pretending the cracks aren\u2019t there. If the foundation\u2019s gone, what\u2019s the point in painting the walls?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the physical symptoms and pressure to support your daughter are making everything feel unstable right now. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is all connecting for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess you\u2019re right about the pressure, but what\u2019s missing is how I blame myself for everything falling apart. The garden\u2019s a mess, and my daughter\u2019s been texting me\u2014says I look empty. I can\u2019t even reply. My hands shake so bad, but the doc says it\u2019s stress. It\u2019s like... if the foundation\u2019s gone, what\u2019s the point in painting the walls?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how self-blame feels central to this sense of unraveling, especially with your daughter\u2019s concern adding to the weight. What did I miss or get wrong about how this self-criticism is shaping your experience right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re close, but you\u2019re not seeing how my whole foundation\u2019s been rotting since I was a kid. My mom taught me that resting meant I was lazy, so even now, when my body\u2019s screaming for sleep, I\u2019m out here trying to fix the garden or take on extra shifts. It\u2019s not just the divorce or the stupid website project\u2014it\u2019s this constant hum of \u2018you\u2019re failing\u2019 that won\u2019t shut up, even when I\u2019m doing everything right. My daughter texts me about looking \u2018empty,\u2019 but how do I tell her I\u2019m so scared of being a burden she\u2019ll realize I\u2019m not worth the effort? \u2026I guess that\u2019s why I keep nodding off\u2014my brain\u2019s done trying to hold the walls up."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the sense of failing to meet expectations has roots in childhood experiences with your mother, and now it\u2019s entangled with current stressors like your daughter\u2019s needs and the cousin\u2019s project. What did I miss or get wrong about how these factors are shaping your experience?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re not wrong about the mom thing\u2014it\u2019s like she wired me to see rest as a defect. But what\u2019s missing is how that\u2019s making me overcompensate now. I take on the cousin\u2019s website project not just because I\u2019m stressed, but because if I don\u2019t \u2018produce,\u2019 I\u2019m just\u2026 empty, like my mom said. My hands shake when I type, but I tell myself it\u2019s \u2018just fatigue.\u2019 The problem is, my daughter sees me collapse in the garden and thinks it\u2019s \u2018depression,\u2019 but I can\u2019t let her think I\u2019m some broken beam she has to prop up. \u2026I guess that\u2019s why I keep the garden overgrown\u2014let it fall apart first so she doesn\u2019t have to watch me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how your childhood experiences with your mother\u2019s messages about rest and failure have shaped your current drive to overcompensate, even as your body and mind resist. Let me try to piece this together: Your lifelong belief that rest equals weakness, combined with the stress of your divorce, work demands, and your cousin\u2019s project, has created a cycle where you push yourself harder until you physically and emotionally collapse\u2014then use avoidance (like the overgrown garden) to protect your daughter from seeing your struggle. What did I miss or get wrong about how these factors are shaping your experience?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re not wrong, but you\u2019re not seeing the full beam here. I push through because if I stop, I\u2019m just\u2026 empty, like my mom said. The garden\u2019s a mess on purpose\u2014I\u2019d rather it look broken than let my kid see me crumbling. But the website, the shifts, the stupid car repairs\u2026 they\u2019re all just nails in a box that\u2019s already leaking. \u2026I guess what\u2019s missing is how scared I am that when the box finally breaks, nobody\u2019ll bother fixing it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how your fear of becoming a burden to your daughter drives both your overcompensation and intentional avoidance, like letting the garden decay to protect her from your struggle. What did I miss or get wrong about how this fear is shaping your choices right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re close, but you\u2019re still not seeing the full weight of it. I\u2019m not just worried she\u2019ll see me collapse\u2014I\u2019m terrified she\u2019ll realize I\u2019ve been faking this \u2018strong beam\u2019 act for years. Every time I force myself to type through shaking hands for the cousin\u2019s website, it\u2019s another proof I\u2019m not \u2018broken,\u2019 just\u2026 less than. My daughter\u2019s texts sit in my pocket like unopened bills. \u2026I guess what\u2019s missing is how I\u2019d rather the garden die than let her watch me water it with tears."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how your fear of being perceived as a 'less than' or burden\u2014especially by your daughter\u2014is deeply intertwined with your lifelong struggle to equate rest with weakness and overcompensate through labor. What did I miss or get wrong about how this core fear is shaping your choices and physical\/mental state right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re close, but you\u2019re still missing how the beam\u2019s not just groaning\u2014it\u2019s splintering. Every keystroke for that website feels like I\u2019m nailing together a house of cards, hands shaking so bad I\u2019m lucky to hit the right keys. The garden\u2019s a mess? At least weeds don\u2019t ask questions like my daughter\u2019s texts\u2026 I can\u2019t even read \u2019em without my throat closing up. \u2026I guess it\u2019s just\u2026 if she sees me holding this together with bailing wire, she\u2019ll know I\u2019m not the \u2018strong\u2019 mom she needs. \u2026To be honest, the car\u2019s been making these weird noises lately, but who\u2019s gonna fix a broken-down beanie?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me try to capture what\u2019s central here: Your lifelong struggle with equating rest to weakness, combined with current stressors like the cousin\u2019s website and your daughter\u2019s needs, has created a cycle where you overexert until collapsing\u2014then use avoidance (like the garden) to protect your daughter from seeing your struggle. The fear driving this is that if she sees you as \u2018less than\u2019 or a burden, she\u2019ll lose faith in you entirely. What did I miss or get wrong about how these threads are woven together for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re not wrong about the beam analogy\u2014I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to hold up, even if it\u2019s splintering. The website\u2019s just another weight on it, and the kid\u2019s college apps\u2026 those papers feel like they\u2019re in my hands, but I can\u2019t even read them straight. My daughter\u2019s texts just sit there, you know? I don\u2019t want her thinking I\u2019m\u2026 I don\u2019t know, some broken-down beanie who can\u2019t even fix her own garden. But I\u2019m trying. I really am."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how deeply entangled your fear of being a burden is with your lifelong struggle to equate rest with weakness, and how current stressors are amplifying this. What would be the first step you\u2019d like to take moving forward to help with this?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess\u2026 maybe starting with the college apps. I\u2019ve been putting them off because my head\u2019s all over the place, but they\u2019re due soon. If I could just get that one thing done, it might\u2026 I don\u2019t know,\u7a33\u4f4f the beam a little. The garden\u2019s a mess, but that\u2019s on me. The kid\u2019s future isn\u2019t. I\u2019ll handle it. Just\u2026 give me a few days to get my thoughts straight."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me try to summarize what we\u2019ve explored: Over months, you\u2019ve been managing a mix of chronic sleep disruption, physical symptoms like hand tremors, and emotional strain from your divorce, work pressures, and family obligations. These challenges have created a cycle where you push yourself to overcompensate\u2014like taking on the cousin\u2019s website\u2014to avoid feeling like a \u2018broken beam\u2019 for your daughter, but this only deepens your exhaustion and self-criticism. Right now, you\u2019re hoping to stabilize by focusing on your daughter\u2019s college apps, even if it feels overwhelming. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is all fitting together for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You hit most of the cracks in the foundation, but maybe you missed how the car\u2019s constant sputtering adds another weight. Every time I hear that weird knock in the engine, it\u2019s like\u2026 another reminder I\u2019m one misstep from everything falling apart. The hands still shake bad when I try to type the essays, but I\u2019ll get it done. For the kid, I have to. The garden\u2019s a lost cause, but that\u2026 that\u2019s on me. The car? Feels like it\u2019s mocking me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the car\u2019s sputtering feels like another layer of instability, adding to the pressure you\u2019re already managing. What would be the first step you\u2019d like to prioritize moving forward\u2014addressing the college essays, exploring strategies for the shaking hands, or something else?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... the essays have to come first. They\u2019re due in a week, and I can\u2019t let that slip. The hands still shake when I type, but I\u2019ll just slow down. Maybe take breaks. The car... I\u2019ll get that checked eventually. Can\u2019t let one more thing fall apart, you know? It\u2019s like fixing one beam at a time before the whole roof caves in."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how prioritizing the college essays feels essential to you right now as a way to regain control. What kind of support or steps would help you tackle this while managing the physical and emotional strain you\u2019re describing?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess\u2026 breaking the essays into chunks would help. Like, tackle one section a day instead of trying to do it all at once. And maybe\u2026 I don\u2019t know, set a timer? Work for\u4e8c\u5341 minutes, then force myself to rest, even if my head says \u2018keep going.\u2019 The hands still shake like I\u2019m trying to type with ice picks, but slowing down might steady them. As long as I don\u2019t\u2026 as long as I don\u2019t let the car\u2019s sputtering distract me. Can\u2019t fix everything at once. Just\u2026 one beam at a time."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let me try to weave this together: You\u2019re choosing to focus on breaking the college essays into manageable chunks using a timer and rest breaks, while acknowledging the car\u2019s sputtering as a background stressor. This approach reflects your pattern of prioritizing family obligations despite physical and emotional strain, rooted in a lifelong fear of being perceived as \u2018broken\u2019 or a burden. What did I miss or need to adjust about how this plan connects to your needs right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Well, I guess breaking the essays into chunks with the timer\u2014it\u2019s like trying to hold up the beam with one hand while the other\u2019s fixing leaks. The car\u2019s sputtering? That\u2019s just another nail in the same beam. Can\u2019t let the kid see it\u2019s all coming apart, even if my hands are shaking worse lately."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how breaking the essays into manageable chunks feels like a necessary strategy to hold things together, even as the car\u2019s sputtering adds to the weight. What else would help you feel more steady in this process, or is there something I\u2019ve missed that needs attention right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"If the car would just stop sputtering, that\u2019d be one less crack in the foundation. And maybe if that wine actually took the edge off instead of just\u2026 sitting there. But I guess what I\u2019m saying is, I can\u2019t let the kid see the whole beam\u2019s groaning, even if my hands\u2019re shaking worse every day."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you've been carrying a lot on your shoulders, especially with everything going on at work and home. Let's start by going over the next steps we discussed\u2014how does having a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review your progress and adjust any plans sound to you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Another check on the beam, I guess. If the doc says two weeks, that\u2019s the timeline. But the car\u2019s still sputtering like it\u2019s waiting for the next crack. Just\u2026 hope the foundation holds until then. Wine\u2019s not even steadying the hands anymore, but I\u2019ll make it work. For the kid\u2019s sake."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how much you\u2019re prioritizing your daughter\u2019s needs right now, even when things feel shaky. The follow-up in two weeks will give us a chance to check how you\u2019re managing\u2014would you like to mention anything else before we wrap up today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Maybe\u2026 the garden. It\u2019s just another crack in the foundation, I guess. Used to be my anchor, but now it\u2019s weeds and dead soil. And the wine? Doesn\u2019t even steady the hands anymore. But the kid\u2019s essays? I\u2019ll see that through. Even if my head feels like a broken radio sometimes."}
