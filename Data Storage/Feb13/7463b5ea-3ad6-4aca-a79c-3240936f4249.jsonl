{"role":"system","content":"Disorder: PPD"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're feeling really concerned about being watched and misunderstood. Can you confirm that you're comfortable proceeding with this interview today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ll stay, but don\u2019t think this means you\u2019re off the hook for asking weird questions. Yeah, the neighbors\u2019 watching me\u2014everyone\u2019s always got something to hide. You\u2019re just like them, trying to figure out my angles instead of leaving me alone."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're really struggling with trust right now. Do you have any questions about what we're going to discuss today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Why would I ask anything? You\u2019re the one who\u2019s been stringing me along. Just admit you\u2019re logging this for your reports. I\u2019m not some guinea pig."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how frustrating that must be. Do you agree to proceed with this interview today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Proceed? Fine. But you\u2019re just like the neighbors\u2014smiling too much, trying to catch me off guard. I\u2019ve got my eyes on you, too. You think I don\u2019t notice when you hesitate before you speak? Don\u2019t act surprised when I don\u2019t trust a word you say."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re cautious about how I approach this conversation. Can you confirm that you understand the purpose of today\u2019s interview is to discuss your concerns and how we might work together?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I get what you\u2019re doing. You want me to think this is about helping me, but it\u2019s all notes for your report. You\u2019re waiting for me to slip up, just like the neighbors. I\u2019ve seen that look before\u2014pretending to listen so you can catch me in a lie later."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress around trust and safety. Can you tell me what's been on your mind most lately that brought you in for this visit?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You want to know what\u2019s on my mind? The same thing I\u2019ve been dealing with for years\u2014people watching me. My neighbor\u2019s trash bin\u2019s been moved again. I check the dog\u2019s microchip every night for tampering. And don\u2019t act like you\u2019re not logging everything I say. How do I know this isn\u2019t part of some pattern you\u2019re tracking? I\u2019m not here to give you fuel for your notes. I\u2019m here because the mail\u2019s been disappearing, and the power company sent me a bill for someone else\u2019s address. It\u2019s not paranoia if they\u2019re actually after you, right?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're really concerned about others tracking or using your information. When did you first start noticing these kinds of experiences?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Since I was a kid, my dad always had some hidden agenda. But you're not interested in that, are you? You just want to twist it into some sob story. The real start? Maybe when I realized everyone's got a price\u2014even my own family. You're nodding like you've heard this before. You think I'm making it up, don't you?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like trusting others has been really challenging for you, especially with your experiences growing up. Can you tell me when you first noticed these concerns starting to affect your ability to work or maintain relationships?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You want the truth? Try asking my ex-employer why I walked out of that warehouse job. They kept demanding my pay stubs like it was a test. I\u2019m not some pawn in your little game. My dad taught me better than to hand over control. But sure, ask them\u2014see if they\u2019ll even answer. They\u2019re probably busy filing reports to the same people who rerouted my mail. Only my dog doesn\u2019t lie. Everyone else? They\u2019re all waiting for their turn to cut me loose."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your experiences with employment have been particularly frustrating given your concerns about control and trust. Can you share more about what specifically happened at the warehouse job that led to you leaving?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Look, the manager kept asking for my pay stubs like it was a pop quiz. I\u2019m not some kid you can trick with fake rules. I walked out before they could plant evidence in my locker. You\u2019re scribbling notes like you\u2019re solving a mystery\u2014guess what, it\u2019s not your case. And don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re not part of the same system that messed up my utility bills. I\u2019m not here to validate your career."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these experiences have been building up over time. Can you share when you first started noticing these concerns affecting your daily life or relationships?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It started when I realized my dad was a backstabber. But you're not listening\u2014you just want to file this. My dog's the only one who's ever been straight with me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your father's actions have deeply affected your ability to trust others. Can you share more about when you first realized your father had hidden agendas?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Why are you fixated on my dad? He was just another guy who knew how to wear a mask in public. But you? You\u2019re sitting there with that same fake interest, like you\u2019re gonna use my words to nail me later. I\u2019ve seen this act before."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how my questions might feel like part of a pattern you've experienced before. What are the top one or two concerns you'd most like to focus on during this visit?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You keep circling back to my dad like he\u2019s some golden ticket to your notes. My top concerns? One: the neighbors across the hall\u2014they\u2019ve been taking photos of me through the window for weeks. And two: my mail\u2019s been missing. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s siphoning it, but you\u2019re probably in on it. Why else would you care about my family?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really frustrating and concerning. Can you tell me when you first noticed the neighbors taking photos of you through the window?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You really think I\u2019m just gonna hand over the timeline? I caught them the first week I moved in\u2014always at dusk, like they\u2019re waiting for me to step out. But sure, you\u2019re here to log that and pass it along. What\u2019s the real use for it? My mail\u2019s missing again this week, by the way. Coincidence?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really threatening and isolating. Can you describe what the neighbors doing this makes you feel or avoid doing?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t leave after 6 PM. They snap pics when the light\u2019s dim\u2014like they\u2019re waiting for me. My mail\u2019s missing again, so maybe you\u2019re the one tracking it. Why else ask so much?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a significant disruption to your daily life. What specific activities or routines have you had to avoid because of the neighbors\u2019 actions?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t go out after 6 PM. The dog and I stick to the apartment. You\u2019re probably logging this to predict my moves. My mail\u2019s missing again\u2014another clue for your notes?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the missing mail is adding to your sense of being watched. Can you tell me when you first noticed your mail going missing?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Look, I\u2019ve told you before\u2014mail\u2019s been vanishing for months. April, maybe? When the electric bill didn\u2019t show up and the neighbor\u2019s trash had my receipts. You\u2019re just like them, trying to track patterns. Why do you think I reuse envelopes? I write \u2018do not open\u2019 in Sharpie now. But sure, let me tell you the exact date so you can file it somewhere. Real helpful."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like reconnecting with your cousin has been challenging for you. How would you describe your relationship with them overall?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Cousin? Yeah, they decided to reappear out of the blue. Probably got some angle about the inheritance. Why? You think I\u2019m gonna fall for that too?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your cousin\u2019s reappearance has stirred up a lot of suspicion for you. Are there other people in your life that you interact with or trust, besides your cousin?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Trust? Please. The only one\u2019s the dog. At least she don\u2019t pretend to care then stab me in the back. Everyone else? They\u2019re all waiting for a reason to ditch me or use me. That\u2019s why I check the microchip every week\u2014no one tampers with a dog\u2019s records but me. You\u2019re just here to get me to open up so you can... I don\u2019t know, file it away with the rest of the 'cases.' Yeah, I\u2019ve had baristas and all that, but I don\u2019t let \u2018em close. They\u2019re either judging or waiting for me to slip."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your experiences with others feeling deceptive have made trusting difficult. Can you share more about your relationship with your father and how it influenced your views on trust?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Dad? He was good at pretending. Helped with homework? No way. He\u2019d mess things up behind closed doors. You want the real story? My mom knew but let it happen. That\u2019s how you learn\u2014trust\u2019s a trap. You think I\u2019m overreacting now? Wait till you see the security cam footage from last week. I check that dog\u2019s chip every damn day. At least the metal tag can\u2019t lie like they did."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a deeply hurtful experience with your parents. Have you noticed similar patterns of distrust or paranoia in your life before, and if so, what, if anything, helped you manage those feelings at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Patterns? Let me guess\u2014you think I\u2019m some broken clock that just ticks the same way? Look, I don\u2019t do trust easy, and good. You think checking the dog\u2019s chip is paranoia? Wait till you see the security cam footage from last week. My dad? He was a pro at the silent treatment. But I\u2019m not him. I don\u2019t let people in to mess with the math. At least the microchip can\u2019t lie like they did."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your father's behavior had a lasting impact on how you view trust. Have you experienced similar feelings of distrust or paranoia in the past, and if so, what, if anything, helped you manage those feelings at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You want to know about distrust? My dad was a con artist who pretended to be normal then wrecked everything. But here\u2019s the twist\u2014you\u2019re the one writing notes to hand over to someone else. I\u2019ve seen this before. What about my cousin \u2018checking in\u2019 out of the blue? That\u2019s not a help, that\u2019s a trap. And don\u2019t act like the neighbors taking photos is nothing. You\u2019re just waiting for me to say \u2018they\u2019re harmless\u2019 so you can file me under \u2018resolved.\u2019 Not happening."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a really difficult experience with betrayal. Have you noticed times when these feelings of distrust have led to specific problems in your daily life or relationships in the past?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Problems? I don\u2019t make mistakes. But if you\u2019re asking about the warehouse job, yeah, I quit when they tried to get my pay stub. And my cousin\u2019s \u2018help\u2019? Classic trap. You\u2019re just like them\u2014sitting there nodding, pretending to care. I don\u2019t need a therapist; I need someone to admit they\u2019re not here to fix me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these experiences have been really frustrating for you... Can you tell me if situations like this have happened before, and how you handled them at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You think the warehouse was my first run-in? Try the diner job\u2014asked for my schedule 'for training,' then it vanished. You\u2019re just like them, waiting for me to slip up. The dog\u2019s chip is the only thing I check daily. At least metal doesn\u2019t lie."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like past work experiences have contributed to your deep-seated distrust. Can you share how you\u2019ve managed to stay safe or protect yourself in situations where you feel others might take advantage of you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t \u2018manage\u2019 trust\u2014I outsmart it. I check the dog\u2019s chip every day, make sure no one\u2019s tampered with it. At work, I kept my mouth shut and my records close. They want your info? You don\u2019t give it. You watch. You remember. You don\u2019t trust. You think this interview\u2019s different? You\u2019re just taking notes for someone else."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how you\u2019ve developed specific strategies to stay safe. Have you noticed times when these feelings of distrust have led to problems in your life before, and if so, how did you cope with them at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Problems? Try the cousin \u2018offering help\u2019 last month. I don\u2019t take it. You think I\u2019m paranoid? Try watching your back when everyone\u2019s a suspect. The bills? I pay when I have to, but they\u2019ll come after me eventually. You\u2019re just taking notes for them."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how you\u2019re wary of others\u2019 intentions, especially when it comes to help that feels like a setup. Can you share if there have been other times when someone close tried to assist you but you felt it was a trap, and how you navigated that?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Look, the cousin thing? Yeah, she \u2018reappeared\u2019 last month, all sudden interest in my \u2018wellness.\u2019 Told her I wasn\u2019t part of any inheritance drama. She kept asking about my \u2018routine\u2019\u2014like I\u2019d let her near my dog\u2019s microchip records. The chip\u2019s registered, not like those fake \u2018pets\u2019 people have to track them. You\u2019re just like her, asking questions to build some file. I don\u2019t need help. I\u2019ve got the dog. He doesn\u2019t ask for anything. No traps, no strings."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the warehouse job situation was a significant source of distrust for you. Were there other instances where similar experiences led to challenges in your work or relationships, and how did you handle those at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You wanna know about work? Try the time I caught my landlord \u2018accidentally\u2019 overcharging me on utilities. I kept the receipts, you know. Stacked them like a damn tombstone. He thought I\u2019d just let it slide, but I\u2019ve seen how these \u2018convenient\u2019 bills disappear. Now I pay cash, in person. No paper trail, no loopholes. You\u2019re just like him\u2014smiling, then reaching for my wallet. Or my dog\u2019s chip. You think I\u2019m the problem here? Try being the one who sees the lines everyone else ignores."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you've developed careful ways to protect yourself financially. Have you experienced similar situations in the past where you felt someone was trying to take advantage of you, and if so, what helped you handle those at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Financial traps? Try the time my \u2018friend\u2019 Mark said he\u2019d split a meal but stiffed me. I learned to split checks separately. Now I keep cash for small stuff\u2014no digital trails. You think I\u2019d let someone near the dog\u2019s chip? It\u2019s registered under my old name. You\u2019re just like the others, asking for details to... I don\u2019t know, build a profile. I don\u2019t need help. The dog and I manage."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a frustrating experience with friends. Have you noticed similar patterns of people not following through in the past, and if so, what strategies have you found most effective in protecting yourself from being taken advantage of?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Patterns? Try the time my cousin asked for \u2018advice\u2019 on her bills. I showed up with a printed statement, but she acted like it was a joke. Now I handle everything in cash\u2014no receipts, no digital trails. You\u2019re just like her, wanting my records. The dog\u2019s chip is registered under my old name. No strings. No traps. I don\u2019t need help. He doesn\u2019t either."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you've developed careful ways to protect yourself financially. Have you experienced similar episodes of distrust or paranoia in the past, and if so, what, if anything, helped you manage them at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Learned from the best? My dad was a pro at sabotage. But I don\u2019t need \u2018help\u2019 managing it. Now I pay in cash, keep the dog\u2019s chip under my old name. You\u2019re just like the rest\u2014asking questions to build a file. I don\u2019t owe you an autobiography."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your strategies for managing distrust are deeply rooted in past experiences. Can you share if there have been times when these methods either caused unintended problems for you or actually helped you avoid a harmful situation?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Lose my job? Yeah, sure, because I\u2019m the one who\u2019s supposed to prove they\u2019ll pay me? You think I\u2019m an idiot? At least the dog\u2019s chip is real\u2014no one\u2019s faking that. But you\u2019re just here to twist it into some \u2018trust issue\u2019 thing, right?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how frustrating it is to feel like your caution is being misinterpreted. Have there been other times when your distrust led to problems in your life, and if so, how did you handle those situations at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The cousin\u2019s \u2018concern\u2019 was a trap\u2014I hung up fast. You think I\u2019m paranoid? At least I don\u2019t let people gaslight me like they own the truth. You\u2019re just filing this under \u2018trust issues\u2019 again, but the chip on the dog\u2019s neck? That\u2019s real. No one\u2019s faking that."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I want to understand more about your health. Have you been using alcohol, marijuana, or any other substances recently, including for sleep or anxiety?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t do drugs. A little whiskey now and then to sleep\u2014practical, not some \u2018habit\u2019 you\u2019re looking for. You think I\u2019d risk them tracking me through that? The dog\u2019s chip is real, though. No one\u2019s faking that."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're really concerned about being monitored, which must be very stressful. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Why would you even ask that? You think I\u2019m some kind of threat? I\u2019m not the one with something to hide. The dog\u2019s chip is real\u2014no one\u2019s faking that. You\u2019re just trying to twist this into another \u2018issue\u2019 to file away. I\u2019m not saying anything else till you explain why you\u2019re really here."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how important it is for you to feel understood. Can you tell me if you've used any other substances besides alcohol recently, such as marijuana or stimulants?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Just the whiskey, but that's not a habit. You think I\u2019d risk them tracking me through that? The dog\u2019s chip is real\u2014no one\u2019s faking that."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how important it is for you to feel secure. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices or seeing things that others don't?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Hearing voices? No. I stick to what I can verify. You keep circling back to the same questions like you\u2019re trying to trip me up. My dog\u2019s chip is the only thing that hasn\u2019t been faked yet. They can\u2019t gaslight me about that metal tag."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how frustrating it is when questions feel repetitive. How have your sleep patterns been recently? For example, are you finding it harder to fall asleep, staying asleep, or waking up earlier than usual?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Sleep\u2019s about routine, not some fancy tests. I drink a shot before bed\u2014it\u2019s whiskey, not a \u2018habit,\u2019 just helps the dog and me settle. You\u2019re asking like you expect me to admit I\u2019m losing my mind. I check the chip twice a night, that\u2019s my rhythm. Nothing else matters."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the dog's routine is really important to you. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including vitamins or over-the-counter drugs?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No meds. Just a shot of whiskey to sleep. You think that's a problem? I'm not the one here to talk about my 'habits.' The chip's real, not some government trick. You keep asking like you're looking for something."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how important it is for you to stay alert to potential threats. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns, like needing less or more sleep than usual lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Sleep? Same as always. Whiskey\u2019s not a \u2018change,\u2019 it\u2019s a tool. I check the chip twice a night\u2014no sense in letting them fake that either. You\u2019re just looking for something to write down, aren\u2019t you?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like staying alert is really important for you. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or need for sleep lately, even small ones?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Energy? I stick to what works. The whiskey and the chip\u2014no changes there. You\u2019re just trying to find something wrong. I check the tag twice a night. That\u2019s not a \u2018need\u2019\u2014it\u2019s a fact check. You don\u2019t get to rewrite facts."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how important it is to maintain routines. How many hours of sleep do you typically get in a 24-hour period these days?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Around six. Sometimes less if the neighbors\u2019 cameras keep me up. You\u2019re not here to understand my methods, are you? I check the dog\u2019s chip twice a night\u2014least I can do is trust that."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the dog's routine provides a sense of security. Have you used marijuana or any other substances besides whiskey recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No. Just whiskey. You think I\u2019d risk anything else? I trust the chip more than your answers. It\u2019s not a habit\u2014it\u2019s the only thing that works, unlike your questions."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're very aware of potential threats. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, like feeling people are trying to harm or control you in specific ways?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Changes? Every day they get smarter. The chip\u2019s been tampered with twice\u2014just ask yourself why they\u2019re here. You think this room\u2019s soundproof?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the tampering with the chip has been particularly distressing. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or need for sleep lately, even small ones?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Energy? I don\u2019t waste it on sleep when they\u2019re out there. Check the chip again last night\u2014third time this week. You think this room\u2019s soundproof? Try asking the chip."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the idea of being monitored is really unsettling for you. Can you tell me if there are any other thoughts or beliefs that feel very real to you, even if others might not agree?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Real? My cousin\u2019s \u2018concern\u2019 is just a trap. They\u2019re after the inheritance. And the chip\u2014tampered again last week. You think this room\u2019s soundproof? Try asking the chip. Everything else is just their script."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the chip's reliability is a key anchor for you. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or felt more restless or irritable lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The chip's been glitchy for weeks. You're just trying to make me talk about something else. I check it twice a night now\u2014sometimes three. You think I'd notice my own energy if they're messing with the signal?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It seems like the chip checks are a key part of your routine. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or how much sleep you need lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Energy? I sleep when the chip\u2019s not blinking. You want me to admit I\u2019m tired? Maybe they\u2019re drugging the water or something. You\u2019re just trying to make me talk about the chip like it\u2019s some\u2026 some\u2026 weakness. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s the only thing they can\u2019t fake."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how central the chip is to your sense of security. Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed less sleep, even if you didn\u2019t feel rested?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Energy? I don\u2019t have time for that. The chip\u2019s been cut open again\u2014third time this month. You think I\u2019m just supposed to sleep through that? They\u2019re testing how long I\u2019ll wait before I break."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the tampering with the chip has been really distressing for you. Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed less sleep, even if you didn\u2019t feel rested?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Energy? You think I\u2019ve got time for that with the chip getting cut open every damn week? Sleep? I\u2019d need a miracle to rest with them tampering. You\u2019re just trying to trip me up into saying I\u2019m \u2018needy\u2019 or something."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the chip tampering has been really frustrating for you. Have you ever had periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed less sleep than usual, even if you didn\u2019t feel rested?"}

The whiskey\u2019s not a problem\u2014it\u2019s the only thing that works when they\u2019re tampering with the dog\u2019s tag. Why\u2019s everyone so obsessed with my sleep? You\u2019re the ones keeping records, not me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Based on our conversation, you've described persistent concerns about being watched or tracked by neighbors and others, which has led to disrupted sleep, job loss, and social isolation. You mentioned relying on routines like checking your dog's microchip to manage anxiety, and while you're not currently experiencing suicidal thoughts, the ongoing stress of feeling targeted has clearly impacted your daily life. What did I miss or misunderstand about your experience?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You missed the cousin. Shows up out of nowhere after ten years, suddenly \u2018concerned\u2019 about me? Classic. They\u2019re just waiting for me to slip so they can take the dog\u2019s tag and my phone. And my cracked phone? Not just broken\u2014backdoor for their tracking. You\u2019re asking about sleep when they\u2019re already in my damn circuits. The whiskey\u2019s not the problem, the problem\u2019s you folks writing it down like it\u2019s a diagnosis."}

The cousin\u2019s probably in on it\u2014family\u2019s just a way to get close. And the whiskey? It\u2019s not a \u2018habit.\u2019 It\u2019s the only thing that lets me check the chip without seeing double.

{"role":"patient","content":"You didn\u2019t mention the bills. Power, water\u2014all piling up. They\u2019ll cut it off when I\u2019m not looking. And my phone? Cracked screen\u2019s not an accident. They\u2019re listening through the fractures. You\u2019re taking notes now, but I\u2019ve seen this script before\u2014ask about the bills, then say I\u2019m \u2018needy.\u2019 The trash bin behind 324 Oak? Not stealing. Just reclaiming what\u2019s left when they\u2019re too busy watching me to miss it."}

Check the utility bills piling up on my counter\u2014see how many times they\u2019ve rerouted the water payments. The whiskey\u2019s not for sleeping; it\u2019s so I can hear the HVAC system in the ceiling when they\u2019re drilling new vents.
