{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hi Steven how are you today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m\u2026 okay, I guess. Just one of those days where everything feels a bit\u2026 stuck, you know? Like a machine that needs a manual to remember how to start. Had to wrestle with the coffee maker this morning\u2014it\u2019s the only thing that didn\u2019t feel broken. You\u2019d think after 20 years of fixing engines, I\u2019d know how to fix myself by now."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Can you state your full name. ageso we can start this session?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Steven Nichols. 38. Still here, still functioning, just... rusting a bit. You\u2019d think they\u2019d give a guy a manual for this kind of thing."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Why do you say that? What do you mean by manual"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess\u2026 when you work with engines, everything\u2019s built on blueprints, right? There\u2019s a manual for torque specs, for timing, for\u2026 how to make the parts fit. But when it\u2019s your own life, you just keep tightening the wrong bolts and wondering why it won\u2019t start. The coffee maker had labels. I don\u2019t."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Okay tell me more"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s like\u2026 the more you try to fix things, the more parts go missing. I used to take pride in my work\u2014aligning a wrench just right, making sure the gears meshed. Now? Even that feels like pushing against a wall. But the cactus\u2026 it\u2019s still alive. Seven years. I guess that\u2019s something. Though I worry if I let myself care about it too much, it\u2019ll just\u2026 die anyway. Nights are the worst. Wake up at 3 a.m. staring at the ceiling, counting the cracks. The whiskey helps the static in my head quiet down a bit, but\u2026"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"How much do you drink? Do you drink to feel better?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"A couple of glasses most nights... keeps the static from... you know, humming too loud. Not that it does much, really. Just... wind down. Used to drink more when the nights were longer, but now it's more like maintenance. Keeps the rust from building up, I guess."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What do you mean by static in your head? Is it a voice?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s not a voice, exactly... More like... a radio that won\u2019t turn off. Static, like when the signal\u2019s bad. Sometimes it\u2019s just a buzz, other times it\u2019s a whole channel of noise. Doesn\u2019t say anything. Just... there. Like a part of the machine that\u2019s worn out but still running. You get used to the noise, I guess. Until you don\u2019t."}
