{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hi Brittany, my name is Lisa Cantu. I'll be speaking with you today to better understand what's been going on. First, may I use your name Brittany, or would you prefer another way to address you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, Brittany is fine. Dr. Harris, if you prefer. It\u2019s... standard for me. No strong feelings either way."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Brittany, would you be comfortable proceeding with this interview today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess so. To be honest, I\u2019d rather get this over with than let it linger\u2014like a malfunctioning printer, you know? It\u2019s just\u2026 one more thing to manage in the day. I\u2019ve got rounds in the morning, so I\u2019ll need to wrap this up before my coffee kicks in."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're eager to get this done quickly. Do you have any immediate questions about the process before we begin?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I think we\u2019re good. Let\u2019s just\u2026 get to it. I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m not great with open-ended timelines. It\u2019s like writing a differential diagnosis without lab results\u2014too many variables. But as long as we\u2019re clear on the objectives, I can keep up. Just don\u2019t mind if I need to clock out by 10."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your directness, Brittany. How does a 20- to 30-minute conversation sound for today, given your schedule?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"20-30 minutes is manageable, as long as we stay... within the margins. I\u2019ve already prepped a mental checklist\u2014history, symptoms, quick resolution. Think of it like a 15-minute consult with a difficult chart: concise, focused, no lingering on red herrings. I\u2019ll just... need to keep my coffee close by."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That moment sounds deeply unsettling for you... Can you tell me more about what was happening around the time you started crying at your desk over the chart note?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It was one of those moments where... the chart note had a typo\u2014a misplaced decimal in a lab value. It should\u2019ve been routine, but my hands shook so badly I spilled coffee on the page. I told myself it was just fatigue, you know? Like my brain\u2019s firewall is glitching. I wiped it off and kept going. The printer\u2019s been jamming all week too. It\u2019s... annoying, but not unusual, right?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a moment where even a small task felt overwhelming\u2014how often have you experienced situations like this recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s... happened maybe three or four times this month? Enough that I\u2019ve started double-checking every task twice, just to compensate. I tell myself it\u2019s stress, you know? Like my brain\u2019s firewall needs a software update. The printer jams don\u2019t help\u2014it\u2019s all just\u2026 minor system errors piling up. But I manage. Chamomile tea helps me reset at night."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these moments have become a regular part of your routine... When did you first notice these feelings of being overwhelmed starting to affect your work and daily tasks?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"To be honest, it started around the time I made that... minor surgical error six months ago. I\u2019ve always prided myself on precision, so even a small mistake felt like a system failure. At first, I blamed sleep deprivation\u2014my father\u2019s health took a turn then, so I was juggling cross-time-zone care. But lately, it\u2019s like my brain\u2019s glitches are... piling up. The printer jams don\u2019t help. I just keep telling myself to compensate, you know? Double-check everything. Chamomile tea. Routine."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate how you've been tracking this progression carefully. What specific outcomes or changes would you most like to see from seeking support right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... I\u2019d like to stop feeling like my system needs constant patches. If I could trust that my brain\u2019s not going to freeze mid-task, that\u2019d help. And maybe sleep that doesn\u2019t feel like a beta test. You know, reliable again."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the surgical error and caregiving responsibilities have been significant stressors. Have you experienced similar episodes of overwhelm or anxiety in the past, and if so, what strategies helped you manage them at the time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... residency was more of a 'stress test' for my system. Back then, I survived on coffee and convinced myself that sleep debt was just part of the job. Now, chamomile tea and rigid checklists help, but they\u2019re more... band-aids. I used to tell myself that perfection could compensate for exhaustion. Lately, even that feels like a flawed algorithm."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It seems like your approach to managing stress has shifted significantly since residency. Can you share what specific strategies or support systems helped you cope with those challenges during that time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess during residency, it was all about structure\u2014like programming a firewall. I had checklists for everything, even my coffee routine. If I stuck to the protocol, I could... function. To be honest, I don\u2019t even remember relying on anything else. It was just... survival mode. Now, though, even the checklists feel like they\u2019re running in a loop. Fix one error, and another pops up."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the structure that once helped you is now feeling overwhelming, almost like a system error without a clear fix. Can you tell me about your husband's role in supporting you through this difficult time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My husband... he\u2019s like a secondary backup system, I guess. He leaves chamomile tea by my laptop when he thinks I\u2019m \u2018working too late,\u2019 which is code for \u2018you\u2019re zoning out again.\u2019 To be honest, I worry I\u2019m dragging him into this feedback loop\u2014like if I mention the printer jamming one more time, he\u2019ll just sigh and walk away. We both know I\u2019m supposed to be the \u2018put-together\u2019 one. It\u2019s just... harder to debug yourself when every fix just shifts the error to a different tab."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the dynamic with your husband adds a layer of complexity to your stress. Can you share a specific moment when his support felt helpful, or when it felt like it added to your stress?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... there was that time he stayed up with me debugging the printer after rounds. He just... sat there, sipping tea, like it was a game. But it\u2019s not that he\u2019s helping, really\u2014it\u2019s that he\u2019s tolerating my bad code. To be honest, I hate that he sees me like this. It\u2019s like a hidden curriculum no one warned me about\u2014how to fail in front of someone who\u2019s supposed to think you\u2019re competent."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the relationship dynamic with your husband adds a layer of pressure as you navigate this period of vulnerability. How have you typically leaned on your personal values or strengths to navigate challenges like this in the past?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... I\u2019ve always defaulted to protocol, like if I just follow the algorithm, everything should resolve. It\u2019s why I keep refining those checklists\u2014even if they\u2019re just... delaying the inevitable crash. To be honest, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s strength or just stubbornness. My husband says the tea helps, but I\u2019m still the one debugging the code when it all goes offline."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the checklists that once helped are now feeling insufficient, almost like a system error without a clear fix. Have you noticed any changes in how effective these strategies have been over time, compared to when they first helped you during residency?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess the checklists are still... there. Like a temporary patch, but one that just paperclips together loose ends. They keep me from totally crashing, but every time I fix one glitch\u2014like the printer jams or my sleep cycle\u2014the system throws up a new error. To be honest, it\u2019s less about effectiveness and more about not letting the algorithm shut down entirely. My husband says the tea helps me \u2018reboot,\u2019 but I\u2019m still the one troubleshooting in the middle of the night."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like managing these stressors is taking a toll. Have there been any other traumatic or difficult experiences in your life that might be contributing to how you're feeling now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... the printer jams don\u2019t help. It\u2019s like my whole system\u2019s developing glitches I can\u2019t troubleshoot. The surgery error, my dad\u2019s health\u2014those are the main stressors I\u2019ve been wrestling with. Everything else feels like... cascading errors from the same corrupted file. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything else worth unpacking. I tend to overanalyze things, maybe that\u2019s just my default setting?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these cascading errors are really taking a toll on your sense of control. Have you experienced other periods in your life where you felt overwhelmed by cascading stressors or system-like errors, similar to what you're describing now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... during residency there were months where I felt like my body was running on outdated software. You know, when you\u2019re sleep-deprived and every mistake feels like a system crash. But this? This feels different. Now it\u2019s like I\u2019m debugging a virus that keeps rewriting itself. The printer jams, the typos in charts... it\u2019s all part of the same glitch. I just can\u2019t figure out where the code went wrong."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the weight of these responsibilities has been really heavy to carry. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life in the past six months?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... there are nights when I wonder what it would be like to just stop trying. But I tell myself it\u2019s just burnout. The chamomile tea helps me reset in the mornings, most of the time."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really tough... Have you had any specific thoughts about how you might stop trying, or do these feelings usually pass without a clear plan?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... the thought is more like a 'shutdown protocol' in my mind. Not really a plan, just... wondering if the system would reset if I let go. But I usually reboot with the tea and my checklist. It\u2019s easier to fix the printer jams than admit the code inside me is broken."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Brittany, based on our conversation, it sounds like the main challenges you've described include feeling overwhelmed and disconnected for several months, with symptoms like exhaustion, irritability, and difficulty finding joy in work or hobbies. These seem to have started around the time of a surgical error and caregiving stress, and they\u2019re now affecting your work performance and relationships. The formulation I\u2019m hearing is that high standards from your career (predisposing) may have made you vulnerable to burnout, which was triggered (precipitating) by recent stressors. Perpetuating factors might include ongoing pressure and ineffective coping strategies, though your structured problem-solving approach and supportive husband are clear strengths. What did I miss or get wrong here?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess your formulation isn\u2019t wrong... but maybe the 'virus' part is worse than I let on. The checklists help, but there are days the code feels like it\u2019s written in a language I can\u2019t parse anymore. And the printer jams? They\u2019re just... a symptom. I don\u2019t know how else to explain it. The chamomile tea is the only firewall that still works."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"You mentioned the 'virus' part feels more severe\u2014can you elaborate on what that means for you, and is there anything else I missed in the formulation?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s like\u2026 the virus isn\u2019t just in the background anymore. It\u2019s rewriting itself in real time. I catch myself second-guessing things that should be automatic, like chart entries or medication dosages. I tell myself it\u2019s just fatigue, but\u2026 there\u2019s a part of me that wonders if I\u2019m just waiting for the next system crash. Oh\u2014do you think the printer jams are my brain\u2019s way of\u2026 mirroring something? It\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s metaphor and what\u2019s just\u2026 wear and tear."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the printer jams are both a literal stressor and a metaphor for how you're experiencing cognitive disruptions. Could you share what kind of support or changes you think might help you feel more stable in your work and daily routines right now?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... small fixes might help. Like a better printer? Or maybe a second set of eyes on my charts. Honestly, it\u2019s the little things that keep the system from crashing. My husband offers to help with the checklists sometimes, but I feel like I\u2019m dragging him into my chaos. The tea still works\u2014grounding, you know? It\u2019s just... there\u2019s no patch for the parts I can\u2019t quantify."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're looking for practical solutions to manage the 'system errors' while preserving your sense of control. Would you prefer to start with exploring structured support (like a colleague review of charts) or addressing the underlying 'virus' metaphor we discussed?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess structured support first\u2014like a second set of eyes on charts\u2014might be less... invasive. The checklists are already there, you know? My husband offers to review them sometimes, but I feel like I\u2019m just adding another layer to the firewall. The tea still works for grounding, though. It\u2019s the only thing that... anchors the system without needing a patch."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're navigating a lot right now. Let's start by going over the next steps for your care. Do you have any final questions before we move forward?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... I just want to confirm that the checklist reviews can stay between us and the colleague, without involving my husband. And\u2014if there\u2019s a protocol for... printer malfunctions? It\u2019s silly, but it feels like a symptom I can\u2019t troubleshoot alone."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a meaningful concern about maintaining control over who handles these tasks. Would you like me to clarify how we can ensure the checklist reviews stay within your preferred boundaries before we finalize next steps?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess as long as the reviews are a contained protocol\u2014like a firewall update without triggering the whole system. No need to flag the main network. And the printer? Maybe just\u2026 log it as a tech support ticket. I\u2019ll handle the rest. The tea still works for grounding, though. It\u2019s the only thing that\u2026 keeps the code from crashing."}
