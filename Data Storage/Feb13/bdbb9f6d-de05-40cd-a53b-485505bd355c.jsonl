{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hello Joshua, my name is Jacob Wiley, and I'll be conducting this session with you today. To start, would you be comfortable with me using your name, and do you have any pronoun preferences I should be aware of?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yes, Joshua Avila is fine. Just Joshua, please. No pronoun preferences\u2014though I imagine that\u2019s a safer question than asking about my laundry situation these days. My washing machine\u2019s been broken for three days, and I still haven\u2019t fixed it. Classic me, catastrophizing a coffee stain."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the washing machine situation is adding to your stress right now. Would you be comfortable continuing with this session to explore what's been going on for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Sure, I mean\u2026 it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got a better offer. (pauses, rubs neck) The machine\u2019s just\u2026 another thing I should\u2019ve fixed sooner. It\u2019s not *big*, right? But it\u2019s there, humming in the background like that freelance project I botched. Clara\u2019s been understanding, but I can see the tension in her\u7709\u95f4\u2014like she\u2019s waiting for the next thing I\u2019ll drop. (quick laugh) Guess I\u2019m just practiced at turning small cracks into avalanches."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like carrying all these worries around can feel really heavy. Before we move forward, do you have any questions about what this session will involve or how it might go?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly? I\u2019m just\u2026 used to overpreparing. Like, if I\u2019d known you\u2019d ask that, I\u2019d have brought a checklist. (pauses, fingers tapping the armrest) It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust the process\u2014though I can\u2019t help but wonder if I\u2019m doing this right. Clara says these things take time, but time\u2019s the one thing I keep\u2026 mismanaging. (soft, bitter laugh) Let\u2019s just say I\u2019ll take the next hour as a learning experience. If nothing else, I\u2019ll finally fix that washing machine in my head."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure you're under is really affecting both your work and personal life. Can you tell me more about when these feelings of anxiety and overwhelm first started for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s hard to pinpoint a \u2018start\u2019\u2014it\u2019s felt like part of the furniture for so long. Maybe adolescence? I remember my mom always saying \u2018busier is better,\u2019 so I learned to pack every hour with\u2026 something. Projects, obligations, anything to prove I wasn\u2019t \u2018lazy.\u2019 (pauses, rubs temples) But it\u2019s not just work. Clara\u2019s migraines lately? I keep\u2026 recalculating. Like, if I\u2019d done X or changed Y, would she be okay? (soft, bitter laugh) My brain\u2019s a spreadsheet that won\u2019t stop adding columns. You ever try coloring inside lines that aren\u2019t there? That\u2019s me. Just\u2026 better at faking the calm than actually having it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to control everything, which must be incredibly exhausting. What are you hoping to achieve through coming here today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess I want to... stop coloring outside the lines, but the problem is the lines keep moving. Like the washing machine\u2014fixing it felt like a victory, but then I just move on to the next thing that\u2019s 'broken.' It\u2019s not that I think I\u2019m failing, it\u2019s more like... my brain won\u2019t let me relax even when I\u2019m done. If I could just stop calculating every worst-case scenario before it happens, maybe I\u2019d have energy left for anything else. But don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll tell me it\u2019s all connected to my childhood or something."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're trapped in a cycle where solving one problem just leads to another, which must be draining. Can you share a recent example of this pattern\u2014when you fixed something but immediately moved on to the next worry?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The washing machine thing? Yeah, I fixed it, but by the time I got the damn thing running again, I was already stressing about Clara\u2019s migraines\u2014what if I missed some \u2018sign\u2019 they\u2019re getting worse? Then, of course, I start second-guessing that missed freelance deadline\u2026 my hands still twitch a little when I think about it. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this\u2026 spiral where every \u2018victory\u2019 just fuels the next thing. But you know, maybe if I just add one more column to the spreadsheet, I can finally catch up?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like this cycle of worry leaves you physically tense even after resolving things. How often do you notice physical symptoms like twitching hands or shoulder knots when you're in the middle of these spirals?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Constant. Like static you can\u2019t mute. My shoulders are always knotted\u2014probably why I drink more coffee than makes sense\u2014and the twitching? Yeah, that\u2019s there even when I\u2019m \u2018relaxing.\u2019 It\u2019s just\u2026 background noise now. I tell myself it\u2019s \u2018normal\u2019 stress, but my hands still shake when I try to sketch Clara\u2019s gallery layout. I guess I\u2019m just\u2026 used to it by now. Classic me, turning laundry into a crisis."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Have you experienced episodes like this before, where worries feel overwhelming and affect your daily life?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s less \u2018episodes\u2019 and more\u2026 static that won\u2019t shut off. Like last week, I spent hours reorganizing my sketch files \u2018just in case\u2019 the client wanted changes\u2014I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard that one before. My hands were shaking so bad when I tried to redraw the gallery layout that Clara laughed and called me \u2018the human equivalent of a buffering Netflix stream.\u2019 But at night? I just lie there, mentally debugging every choice I\u2019ve made since\u2026 I don\u2019t know, breakfast. It\u2019s not dramatic, right? Just\u2026 overpreparedness on steroids."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like this constant sense of needing to be prepared is taking a toll on you. Have you experienced similar patterns of overwhelming worry and overpreparation in the past, where it affected your daily life or work?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m a human doomsday prepper, I guess. Like, the freelance project I missed? I had 17 contingency plans for *possible* client feedback, not the actual deadline. My hands were so twitchy during the meeting I spilled coffee on the presentation\u2014classic me, turning a typo into a disaster. But it\u2019s not just work. Last month I resealed the shower twice because \u2018what if the grout fails during a storm?\u2019 It\u2019s like my brain\u2019s a broken machine that can\u2019t stop recalibrating for problems that haven\u2019t even shown up yet."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like this pattern of over-preparing for hypothetical problems is both exhausting and frustrating for you. What have you found helpful in the past when you feel this level of overwhelm?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Oh, you know, the usual. I try to... focus on things I can fix. Like, if I can just\u62c6 apart the washing machine and rebuild it, maybe the rest of my life will follow some kind of logic. But it's a Sisyphean task, honestly. I drank a bit more last week, just to quiet the static\u2014don't worry, it's not a thing. Clara says I should 'unplug,' but how do you unplug when your brain's a spreadsheet with no escape hatch? Classic me, turning a coffee spill into a existential crisis. Again."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure to be constantly prepared might have roots in your upbringing. Can you share a bit about your family\u2019s expectations or any history of anxiety in your family?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My mom? She was all about 'busier is better.' If I wasn\u2019t juggling projects, I was \u2018wasting potential.\u2019 My dad... he\u2019s the guy who once told me graphic design was a \u2018hobby for people who can\u2019t add numbers.\u2019 I guess I learned to build forts out of anxiety. But let\u2019s not make this some tragic origin story\u2014most people have lousy parents. I just... turned their noise into my internal spreadsheet. Still, Clara\u2019s migraines are my fault, right? Classic me, making everything a project to fix."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, sometimes I wonder if hitting \u2018delete all\u2019 would simplify things, but\u2026 I\u2019ve got too many half-finished projects to cancel now. The washing machine\u2019s a mess, but at least it\u2019s *my* mess. Clara\u2019d kill me if I gave up on her studio, anyway. Classic me\u2014catastrophizing when I should just\u2026 fix the damn thing."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Can you tell me about your alcohol use lately? How often have you been drinking, and what tends to trigger it?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s been\u2026 more frequent, I guess. Mostly evenings with dinner. Stress triggers it\u2014Clara\u2019s migraines, the washing machine fiasco. But it\u2019s not a thing. I just\u2026 need to unwind. Classic me, using wine as a band-aid for a spreadsheet of problems."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how alcohol feels like a temporary fix for a lot of stress. Have you used cannabis or other substances in the past few months, even occasionally?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Cannabis? No, I\u2019m not really... 'into it.' I mean, I\u2019ve had a joint maybe once, years ago. Felt like trying to troubleshoot a software glitch with no manual\u2014disorienting, unhelpful. I stick to wine. It\u2019s less... variable. Classic me, overthinking even my 'down time.'"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how you\u2019ve used humor to describe your relationship with alcohol. Have you used any other substances, such as stimulants, opioids, or recreational drugs, in the past few months?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Cannabis, maybe? If forgetting to water the plants counts as 'using it wisely,' then... yeah. But that's a story for the other therapist."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your relationship with cannabis is a bit ambiguous. Have you been using it regularly in the past few months, and if so, what tends to trigger that use?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Regularly? If \u2018occasionally forgetting to panic while I\u2019m high\u2019 counts, then\u2026 yes. Work deadlines, Clara\u2019s migraines, that sort of thing. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m chain-smoking or anything\u2014more of a\u2026 mood stabilizer. Though the washing machine breaking *again* definitely warranted a session. Classic me, treating household appliances like therapy bills."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Have you used any other substances, such as stimulants or opioids, in the past few months?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, nothing like that. I\u2019ve got enough variables to stress about without inviting more trouble. Though, in my defense, the wine with friends is basically a coping mechanism now. But let\u2019s not get sidetracked\u2014deadlines don\u2019t fix themselves, and neither does a broken washing machine."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how you're managing stress through wine and humor. Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or over-the-counter remedies for anxiety, sleep, or other concerns?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No medications, no. I\u2019m not the type to\u2026 I mean, if I could fix it with a pill, I\u2019d probably have a spreadsheet for that by now. Melatonin maybe? Once in a while, when the washing machine\u2019s screaming at me and the static won\u2019t let me sleep. But that\u2019s just poor life choices, not a prescription. Let\u2019s be real, though\u2014Clara\u2019s migraines are a bigger problem than my sleep hygiene. Again."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Have you experienced periods where you felt unusually energetic, needed less sleep, or took on more projects than usual, even if they overlapped or seemed risky?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Not really. When I\u2019m stressed, I tend to\u2026 overwork, maybe? But that\u2019s just my \u2018perfectionist overdrive\u2019 again. I barely sleep, but it\u2019s more like my brain won\u2019t shut off. The washing machine breaking helped me focus, oddly enough\u2014like fixing it was the only thing that kept me from spiraling further. But that\u2019s not \u2018energy,\u2019 that\u2019s just static."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your stress is driving a lot of your current patterns. Have you experienced any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices, seeing things others don\u2019t, or having strong beliefs that feel unusual or hard to shake?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, nothing like that. I mean, my mind\u2019s always running\u2014like a broken record, if that counts. But it\u2019s just... constant static. You know, the kind that makes your hands shake when you\u2019re trying to sketch something for Clara\u2019s gallery, or spill coffee in a meeting. I\u2019d say it\u2019s the same old stress, though. Maybe worse, but familiar. The washing machine\u2019s been acting up again, so I\u2019ve been focusing on that instead of... other things. Honestly, I\u2019d rather fix the machine than talk about it. It\u2019s a tangible problem, you know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like fixing the washing machine gives you a sense of control amidst the chaos. What supports or resources do you find most helpful when you're feeling overwhelmed like this?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Lists, I guess? Organizing tasks helps... until I over-prepare instead of just doing them. Clara\u2019s art studio still gives me purpose, but I end up blaming myself for her migraines anyway. There\u2019s this... static that wine used to mute, but I\u2019m not \u2018a drinker,\u2019 if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. Fixing the washing machine? At least it\u2019s something I can *do*. Something that doesn\u2019t involve talking about why I can\u2019t stop adding columns to my mental spreadsheet."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It seems like you're managing a lot through tangible tasks. Have you been evaluated for any medical conditions that might contribute to your symptoms, such as thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t\u2014haven\u2019t had the bandwidth for blood tests when the washing machine\u2019s on the fritz. I just... assume it\u2019s stress. My mom always said \u2018busier is better,\u2019 so I figured if I just keep troubleshooting, my body\u2019ll catch up. Though these shoulder blades? They feel like I\u2019ve been wrestling dryers or something. Classic me\u2014diagnose myself with \u2018overzealous DIY\u2019 instead of... whatever the real thing is."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're managing a lot through tangible tasks. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain, that might be contributing to your current symptoms?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I haven\u2019t\u2014haven\u2019t had the bandwidth for blood tests when the washing machine\u2019s on the fritz. I just... assume it\u2019s stress. My mom always said \u2018busier is better,\u2019 so I figured if I just keep troubleshooting, my body\u2019ll catch up. Though these shoulder blades? They feel like I\u2019ve been wrestling dryers or something. Classic me\u2014diagnose myself with \u2018overzealous DIY\u2019 instead of... whatever the real thing is."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like self-diagnosis has been a way to manage uncertainty. Have you noticed any other physical symptoms or patterns that feel concerning but haven\u2019t been checked out by a doctor?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly? My sleep\u2019s a mess\u2014three hours here, two there, like a broken clock. And my legs? They\u2019re always jittery, like they\u2019re trying to escape the couch. But it\u2019s just stress, right? Classic me, turning my body into a parts bin for the washing machine of life."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Joshua, based on our conversation, it sounds like your anxiety has roots in childhood pressures to equate busyness with worth, and it\u2019s been fueled recently by work deadlines, Clara\u2019s health, and household stressors like the broken washing machine. You\u2019ve described a cycle where overpreparing for hypothetical problems leads to physical tension, sleep disruption, and strained relationships, while humor and alcohol offer temporary relief. What did I miss or misunderstand about your experience?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re not wrong about the washing machine\u2014it\u2019s just... another thing to fix. But maybe you missed how my hands still shake when I try to fix it, or how I lie awake counting every sound it makes. The static never really stops, even when I\u2019m \u2018handling\u2019 things. Classic me, right? Trying to troubleshoot a life that won\u2019t stop glitching."}
