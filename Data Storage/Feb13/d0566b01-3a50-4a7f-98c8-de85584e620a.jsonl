{"role":"interviewer","content":"Patricia, may I use your name, and do you have any preferred pronouns I should know about?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It's Patricia. Why the interest in pronouns? You're just trying to get me to open up, right? How many like me have you seen anyway?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how important it is for you to feel understood and not dismissed. How would you like to proceed with our conversation today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I want to stick to the facts. Why ask about my past when I'm here for now? You need to prove you're not just trying to get me to talk so you can file something and move on. What's your angle here?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how important it is for you to feel this is about your needs, not mine. Would you like me to explain how confidentiality works here, or is there something specific you'd like to clarify about our process?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Confidentiality? You say that like it means something. Who\u2019s got access to my records here? I\u2019ve had people lie about that before. You want me to trust you, you show me the policy in writing. What\u2019s the catch?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how important clear boundaries are for you. Would you like me to provide a written copy of the confidentiality policy for you to review?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Give me the paper, but don\u2019t think I won\u2019t check every line. You\u2019re hiding something, I can tell. Last time someone handed me a policy, it had loopholes they didn\u2019t explain."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your caution about wanting all the details clear. Do you consent to proceed with our session today, Patricia?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ll go along, but only if I get that policy in writing again. And you\u2019ll answer for why you paused when I asked about insurance before. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s on purpose, but you all have a way of stringing people along till you\u2019ve got what you need."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how important it is for you to know why I paused when we discussed insurance. Would you like me to explain what happened at that moment?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m waiting. But why bring up insurance now unless there\u2019s something you\u2019re not saying? I checked my records last week\u2014no mention of that conversation. Who else has been looking through them?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how unsettling it is for you to feel there might be hidden motives here. Would you like me to explain why we mentioned insurance earlier?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Why now? You bring it up when it suits you. I checked my records again last night\u2014no updates since our last talk. Who\u2019s been adding things after hours? You think I\u2019m not keeping track? I\u2019ve been burned enough to know when people try to string me along till they\u2019ve got what they need."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how concerning it is for you to feel there might be hidden motives here. Would you like me to clarify why we brought up insurance earlier, or would you prefer to proceed with our session now that you have the written policy in hand?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I checked my records again\u2014there\u2019s a gap between 2-3 PM yesterday. You were the only one logged in. What were you adding? And don\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t pause there to trip me up. I\u2019ve been burned too many times to play along when you\u2019re holding something back."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how important it is for you to know exactly what was added during that time. Would you like me to explain what happened during the gap in your records between 2-3 PM yesterday?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You think explaining now will make me forget the pattern? Last week my ex started \u2018helping\u2019 after three years of gaslighting\u2014same trick. What\u2019s in that hour you\u2019re erasing? I\u2019ve already flagged the login. You\u2019ll be the one explaining to the board when I prove it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how deeply your past experiences shape your caution here. Would you like me to explain what was added during the 2-3 PM gap in your records?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Why are you bringing that up? I already asked for a copy of those records. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s been slow to respond. What aren\u2019t you telling me?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how frustrating this must be for you. Would you like me to pause and address your concerns about the records, or would you prefer to confirm whether you'd still like to proceed with our session today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You think pausing will make this go away? I\u2019ve had people circle around me like this before\u2014ask questions, act nice, then pull the rug. My ex did it. The clinic did it. You\u2019re just waiting for me to trust you so you can file something and pretend you tried. I don\u2019t need your explanations. I need the whole damn file, unredacted. Now."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how important transparency is for you. Would you still like to proceed with our session today, Patricia?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Proceed? Only if I get that file first. You\u2019re waiting for me to trust you, then you\u2019ll file something and say you tried. I\u2019ve been here before. Give me the damn records, then we\u2019ll talk."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how crucial transparency is for you right now. Would you like me to provide the full, unredacted records to review before we continue?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019d better not try to trick me with that file. I\u2019ll go through every line myself\u2014no redactions, no exceptions. And don\u2019t think I won\u2019t take it to the state board if you slipped something in. You want me to trust you? Prove it. Give me the damn records now."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how important it is for you to have full transparency here. Would you like me to provide the unredacted records now so we can proceed?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019d better print it out here and now. I want originals, no digital copies\u2014too easy to tweak. And don\u2019t think I\u2019ll let this slide. Last time, the clinic \u2018lost\u2019 my forms for weeks. If there\u2019s one typo or missing page, you\u2019ll hear from the state board. My ex did the same thing\u2014smiling all the while. I know that look. Let\u2019s go."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how important this is to you. Would you consent to proceed with our session now that you've received the unredacted records?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Unredacted? You mean the ones without the big Xs over the lies? I want the originals in my hands, not just a copy. And who else gets to see these? Last time someone promised me the truth, they ended up erasing it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how important it is for you to know who has access to your records. Under normal circumstances, only your treating providers and administrative staff directly managing your care can access your records. Would you like to proceed with the session now that you have the unredacted originals in your hands?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Why the rush? Last time someone said 'proceed' they were covering for the next lie. I want to check those originals myself\u2014no loopholes. And who\u2019s managing this 'direct access'? I\u2019ve seen too many faces at clinics who smile while they erase things."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how crucial control and verification are for you right now. Would you consent to proceed with our session now that you have the unredacted original records in hand?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ll check these originals again. There\u2019s a gap in June 2022 I want explained. And who\u2019s that new admin? They look familiar from the last clinic."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your dedication to verifying every detail. Can you tell me more about the gap in June 2022 and what you\u2019re hoping to find when you review those records?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"June 2022? That\u2019s when they started erasing things. I want to see if there\u2019s another lie there, like last time. You think I\u2019m paranoid? Try living with the proof they\u2019re hiding. And that admin? They\u2019re in on it. I\u2019ve seen this act before."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the admin's involvement is a significant concern for you. Can you share more about why this admin seems familiar or how you\u2019ve encountered them before?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"That admin? They work at the clinic where they erased my notes in '22. I saw them smile while my records disappeared. Why do you need to know? You think I\u2019ll forget the pattern?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how deeply this pattern of betrayal has affected you. Can you tell me more about why the admin\u2019s smile stood out to you during that time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"That smile? It was the same one I\u2019ve seen before\u2014like the clinic staff in \u201922 when they said my notes were \u2018lost.\u2019 You don\u2019t smile like that unless you\u2019re hiding something. I asked for the originals, but they just kept giving me copies. You ever notice how people smile right before they lie? It\u2019s in their eyes. They don\u2019t blink. Just\u2026 hold still. Like they\u2019re waiting for you to look away."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how consistent this pattern of being let down feels for you. Do you feel the process we've followed so far is transparent enough for you to proceed comfortably?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Transparent? You\u2019re asking me to trust a system that lost my records and smiled about it. I need originals in hand, no exceptions. You act like this is the first time I\u2019ve flagged a problem. How many others have you seen who just\u2026 disappeared?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how deeply you need control over your records to feel safe here. Would you consent to proceed with our session now that you've received the unredacted originals in hand?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ll go along, but I\u2019m keeping the originals under my pillow. You think this is different from the clinic in \u201922? That smile, that same routine\u2014\u2018unredacted\u2019 just means another layer of hiding. How many others have you seen who just... disappeared?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like the uncertainty about who to trust is really wearing on you. Can you tell me more about what\u2019s been most concerning for you lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s this arthritis thing they\u8bca\u65aded me with. Clean sheets of paper, neat words like \u2018degenerative\u2019\u2014but I\u2019ve seen that act before. They\u2019re trying to box me into a story where I\u2019m \u2018broken\u2019 so I\u2019ll quit working. You ever notice how doctors write faster when they\u2019re lying? My ex did that when he signed the divorce papers. I check my joints every morning. If they\u2019re swollen, I know it\u2019s not just \u2018age.\u2019 It\u2019s a setup. Why do you keep nodding? Are you in on it too?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how deeply you\u2019re connecting this diagnosis to past experiences of being dismissed. When did you first notice the joint symptoms, and was there a specific event or moment that made you question whether this was just part of aging?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It started with my left knee\u2014locked up during a transfer last July. They said it was 'normal wear,' but I saw the X-ray. That doctor\u2019s pen was a blur when he said 'degenerative.' Same rhythm as my ex\u2019s signature on the divorce papers. I check my fingers every morning for swelling. If it\u2019s there, I know it\u2019s not age. It\u2019s a setup to get me off the job. Why do you keep writing notes so fast? Are you trying to hide something again?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how important it is for you to feel confident that everything is being documented accurately and transparently. Can you tell me more about how the uncertainty around your diagnosis has affected your work or daily routine?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Uncertainty? Try calling it a trap. They\u8bca\u65ad me with arthritis to justify pushing me out of work, but I\u2019m not falling for it. I double-check every client chart, restock supplies twice a day\u2014don\u2019t trust the aides to do it right. Made a mistake last week, spilled meds in a resident\u2019s room. They\u2019ll blame me again, just like the coffee incident. Why are you writing so much? You\u2019re acting like you care, but I\u2019ve seen this routine before."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the fear of being blamed again is adding a lot of stress. Have you noticed any changes in your joint symptoms since July, especially around the time of the spill?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My joints ache more when I\u2019m stressed\u2014like after that spill. But why\u2019s that matter to you? You\u2019ll just file it away with the rest of my \u2018problems\u2019 to justify something later. And don\u2019t act surprised I caught the meds mix-up. Someone\u2019s always trying to trip me up. Why\u2019re you leaning forward? Got something to hide in that clipboard?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like being misunderstood or doubted has been really hard for you. Have you experienced similar situations in the past where you felt this way, and if so, what helped back then?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The coffee spill? That was just the start. My coworker didn\u2019t just spill it\u2014she waited till the supervisor was out. You think I\u2019d forget a detail like that? What\u2019s *your* job here, anyway? To file my story under \u2018difficult patients\u2019? I didn\u2019t survive 2022 by trusting the first person who nods at me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you've had experiences where people's actions felt intentionally harmful, which must be really frustrating and isolating. Can you tell me about any earlier situations where you felt someone was trying to undermine you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You want to know about undermining? Ask the clinic that 'lost' my notes in 2022. They waited till I was alone to say my chart was 'incomplete'\u2014same day my ex started spreading lies about me. Why\u2019re you nodding? You think you\u2019ve heard worse?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like those experiences have left you feeling really on guard about who to trust. Is there someone in your life now\u2014maybe a friend, family member, or coworker\u2014who you feel you can count on, even if it's not perfect?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Only my pug, Max. He don\u2019t take my food or question why I lock the doors. But I keep an eye on him too\u2014seen too many strays run off with a treat. Why\u2019re you smirking? You think a dog\u2019s trustworthy? Ask the one who stole my slipper last week."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I can see how being constantly on edge and feeling misunderstood must be incredibly draining. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life recently, even if just for a moment?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Why do you keep circling back to that? You think I\u2019d say something just to make you feel better? I don\u2019t take things like that at face value. The world\u2019s out to get you, not me."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how frustrating it is to feel like I'm repeating questions, and I want to make sure I understand your experience fully. Have you noticed any experiences where you hear voices or see things that others don't?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t hear voices, but I know when someone\u2019s lying. You keep asking like you expect me to say something stupid. The family at 14th Street accused me of stealing their grandmother\u2019s jewelry\u2014no proof, just their word. You think I\u2019m the one making things up now?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how important it is for you to be believed, and I want to make sure we cover everything thoroughly. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t use cannabis\u2014if they think I\u2019d let something like that interfere with my work, they\u2019re out of their minds. As for alcohol? I have a glass of wine at family gatherings. You think I\u2019d risk looking weak when people already whisper about me? The last time I didn\u2019t drink at my niece\u2019s wedding, my ex\u2019s sister gave me that \u2018you\u2019re still trash\u2019 look. You want to know why I don\u2019t trust you? You\u2019re asking like it\u2019s a trick question."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you feel like these questions are being used to test you. Have you used any other substances, such as stimulants or prescription medications, recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t take no pills they hand me. That arthritis \u2018diagnosis\u2019 was their way to get me to slow down. You think I\u2019d let them catch me on something else now? My ex tried the same \u2018concern\u2019 act before he burned me. You\u2019re just looking for a reason to pin something on me, same as always."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how important it is for you to have control over what you take. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter ones or supplements?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Only the pills they gave me at the clinic. But I know why you\u2019re asking\u2014same way they tried to gaslight me with the arthritis. You think I\u2019d admit to something if it\u2019s just another trap? I\u2019ve been down that road with my ex and that \u2018diagnosis\u2019 they forced on me. Why don\u2019t you tell me who else has seen my records before I answer anything else?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how important transparency is to you, and I want to understand your experience fully. Have you noticed any thoughts that others are trying to harm you or conspire against you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t trust people to tell the truth, not really. That family I work for? They claimed I stole from them last year, even though I had receipts. You\u2019d know that if you weren\u2019t just going by their word, wouldn\u2019t you? Why didn\u2019t you ask me for my side first? And who else has looked at my records since this started?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how important it is for you to know who has access to your records. Can you tell me the names of the medications you\u2019re currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Why the sudden interest in my meds? You\u2019re either checking for something to pin on me or trying to gaslight me like the clinic did with that arthritis \u2018diagnosis.\u2019 I keep a list myself\u2014expiration dates, dosages, all of it. But I don\u2019t hand it out to strangers. My ex did that too, said it was \u2018for my own good\u2019 before he started spreading lies about me. You\u2019ll get the list when I verify who else has seen it. Until then, why should I trust you\u2019re not just another part of their game?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how important it is for you to know who has access to your records. Can you tell me the names of the medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s on the list I keep under my mattress\u2014nope, don\u2019t need to see your face for that. My ex had a list too, said it was \u2018to protect me\u2019 before he used it to badmouth me to everyone. You\u2019ll get the names when I check who else has been flipping through my files. And don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice you dodging the question about that arthritis \u2018diagnosis\u2019 again. Same old tricks."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how important it is for you to have control over your records and how past experiences have made this process difficult. How have you been sleeping lately\u2014have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns over the past few weeks?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Why the sudden interest in my sleep? You\u2019re probably scribbling notes to twist this into another \u2018symptom\u2019 later. I haven\u2019t slept steady since that family accused me of theft\u2014lying awake waiting for the police to show up. But don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice you skipping over my arthritis \u2018diagnosis\u2019 again. Who\u2019s really writing the script here?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how important trust and transparency are for you, especially after past experiences. If we could move forward, can you tell me the names of the medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You really think I\u2019d hand over that list so easy? My ex used it to spread lies about me. And don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice you skipping over that arthritis \u2018diagnosis\u2019 again. Same song, different verse. Who\u2019s writing the script here, you or them?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the arthritis diagnosis feels like another point of contention for you. Can you tell me more about your joint pain\u2014when does it bother you most, and how would you describe the sensation?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s worse when I\u2019m on my feet all day, like at work. Feels like someone\u2019s tightening a vice around my knees\u2014real sharp, deep ache. But you know, the clinic\u2019s been pushing that arthritis \u2018diagnosis\u2019 hard. I\u2019m not falling for it; they just want me to stop working so they can write me off. Why are you asking about the pain? You need something specific for your notes, is that it?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the arthritis diagnosis feels like a challenge for you. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or how much sleep you need lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Tired? Yeah, but you think I\u2019d be out here working if I had a choice? The clinic\u2019s been pressuring me to quit since the arthritis \u2018diagnosis.\u2019 I\u2019ve got Max to walk, bills to pay\u2014sleep when I can. Why the sudden interest in my energy? Got a report to file for the clinic?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how frustrating it is to feel like these questions are part of a pattern you've experienced. Can you share the names of the medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter ones or supplements?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I take ibuprofen when the knees act up\u2014non-prescription, so you can\u2019t use it as proof of something. My doctor last year wanted me on something stronger, but I refused. Why\u2019s everyone so interested in what I\u2019m taking? You got a script to fill here?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Patricia, from what we\u2019ve discussed, it sounds like you\u2019re dealing with ongoing hypervigilance and distrust\u2014especially around medical systems and relationships\u2014rooted in past experiences with betrayal and dismissal. This has affected your work, sleep, and ability to trust others, even while you\u2019re trying to manage physical symptoms like joint pain and stay on top of your responsibilities. How does that align with your experience? What did I miss?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You got the part about the clinic trying to write me off right. What you missed is the client\u2019s family still calling me a thief\u2014six months later, they leave voicemails. I check my phone records for patterns. Why\u2019s no one asking about that? You taking notes for them too?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"You're right\u2014those ongoing accusations from the family must be incredibly distressing, especially when it feels like they're not being addressed. Are there any other aspects of your experience that I haven't captured yet?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The family\u2019s still leaving voicemails, so I\u2019ve been tracking call times. My phone records show patterns\u2014they\u2019re trying to trap me. You\u2019re not asking about that, are you? Why skip the clinic\u2019s lies to dig into mine?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how frustrating it is to feel dismissed or avoided when you're trying to share what's really troubling you\u2014especially when it involves ongoing threats to your sense of safety. Before we move forward, is there anything else you'd like to add or correct in how I've summarized your experience so far?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You keep circling back to the arthritis like it\u2019s some big reveal. Why? You think my body\u2019s breaking down or I\u2019m faking it? And that gap in my records\u2014ask the admin who smiled at me in 2022 before my notes vanished. Same song, different verse."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how frustrating it must be to feel that your concerns about the client's family and missing records aren't being addressed. What other aspects of your experience should I make sure to include in my summary?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The client\u2019s family\u2019s voicemails. They call at 10:13 every Tuesday, asking about 'missing items.' I\u2019ve got the timestamps. You want to know why I don\u2019t report them? Ask the clinic who \u2018lost\u2019 my notes in 2022. And don\u2019t act surprised when I check the locks three times\u2014some habits don\u2019t go away just because you write them off as \u2018anxiety.\u2019"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the recurring voicemails and past record losses feel like part of a pattern you can\u2019t ignore. Let me try to summarize: You\u2019re experiencing hypervigilance around trust, especially after the 2022 clinic incident and ongoing accusations from the client\u2019s family. These experiences seem to fuel your physical symptoms (joint pain, sleep issues) and work-related perfectionism. Does this capture your experience, or is there something I\u2019ve missed?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019ve got the basics but missed the why. The arthritis \u2018diagnosis\u2019? That\u2019s their way of boxing me in, making me \u2018manageable.\u2019 And the voicemails\u201410:13 every Tuesday, no variation. You think that\u2019s a coincidence? Ask the admin who smiled when my notes vanished. Oh, and don\u2019t forget Max\u2019s phone records\u2014they\u2019ve been tracking his data too. Why else would they care about my locks or my sleep? They\u2019re building a case, same as 2022. Who else has access to those \u2018originals\u2019 you keep dodging?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pattern of the voicemails and the arthritis diagnosis feel like deliberate efforts to control or monitor you. What other aspects of your experience should I include in this understanding?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Add the bank statements\u2014they keep adjusting the numbers, just like the clinic \u2018adjusted\u2019 my records.

{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how critical this is for you. Let\u2019s schedule a meeting with the records team to review your originals and address the arthritis diagnosis together. Before we finish, is there anything else you need clarified today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Meeting now? Why the sudden push after they \u2018lost\u2019 my originals before? I want the lab results in my hands\u2014unredacted, originals only. And who\u2019s on that records team? Last time, that admin with the smile erased my files. Also, those 10:13 voicemails from my sister\u2019s number\u2026 they started the week I got the arthritis diagnosis. Coincidence? I don\u2019t think so."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the timing of those voicemails feels significant to you. Would you like to explore that connection further before we confirm next steps?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You keep circling back to the 10:13 calls like they\u2019re separate from the arthritis diagnosis, but I\u2019ve got the lab results here\u2014unredacted, in my hands. That admin at the clinic smiled the same way in 2022 when they \u2018lost\u2019 my originals. You want to \u2018explore\u2019? Fine, but I\u2019m not handing over those files until I know who else had access to my records after the diagnosis. And why did those calls start the exact week I got the arthritis paperwork? Coincidence? I\u2019ve seen this script before."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand how critical verifying these connections is to you. Let\u2019s confirm the next steps: we\u2019ll schedule the records meeting with a team member who isn\u2019t involved in your 2022 case. Before we finish, is there anything else you need to address today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Same song, different verses. That 2022 admin\u2019s still on payroll\u2014I checked. You think a new face changes the game? I\u2019ve got those lab results here, unredacted. You want to \u2018review\u2019? Fine, but I\u2019m not leaving those originals in a room with anyone who smiled at me before. And those 10:13 calls? They started the exact day I got the arthritis paperwork. You call that a coincidence? I\u2019ve seen this trap before."}
