{"role":"interviewer","content":"Mr. McCoy, can I start by confirming your name and how you'd like to be addressed? Some people prefer different pronouns, but that's entirely up to you."}
{"role":"patient","content":"Jeff... McCoy. Call me Jeff... if you gotta. Just... don\u2019t matter much now. Like the engine... sometimes it\u2019s got juice, sometimes it don\u2019t."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Jeff, this conversation is about understanding what's been going on and how we can support you. Would you be comfortable moving forward with that?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... suppose. If the engine\u2019s still running, I guess it\u2019s running. But the alternator\u2019s shot. You can check the fuses, but the lights still don\u2019t work. (Pauses, rubs temples slowly.) Mary says talkin\u2019 helps, but she don\u2019t know how the damn thing unwired itself. I try to explain... you can\u2019t jump-start a soul with a screwdriver. (Long silence.) Just don\u2019t ask me to fix it. I\u2019m not even holdin\u2019 the wrench anymore."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Before we begin, do you have any questions about what this conversation will involve or how it will work?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"If the transmission\u2019s fried, askin\u2019 about the spark plugs don\u2019t fix the smoke. (Long pause. Fidgets with a loose thread on his sleeve.) Mary says questions are the starter fluid... but the damn thing\u2019s already rusted shut. (Abruptly stands, then sits again with a shuddering sigh.) Just... don\u2019t bother checkin\u2019 the oil. It\u2019s all burnt to a crust anyway."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how heavy this feels for you, Jeff. Would you like to proceed with this conversation today, even if it feels difficult?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The battery\u2019s dead... you can\u2019t jump a corpse. (Pauses, hand trembles as he grips the thread.) Mary says the starter\u2019s still in there... but she don\u2019t hear the click. (Long silence, voice frays.) Let it die. I\u2019m already sittin\u2019 in the ditch, waitin\u2019 for the tow truck that ain\u2019t comin\u2019."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how overwhelming this feels, Jeff. Would you be open to continuing this conversation today, even if just a little?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I don\u2019t know. Feels like trying to jump-start a \u201972 F-100 with a car battery. You keep... adding cables, checking the terminals, but the metal\u2019s just too thin. (Long pause) The garage is full of rust now. Can\u2019t even hear the starter grind anymore. It\u2019s... quiet. (Voice drops) Quiet\u2019s the worst part."}
