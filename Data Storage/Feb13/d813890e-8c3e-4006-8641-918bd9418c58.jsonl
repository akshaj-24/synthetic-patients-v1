{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now, Donna. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to make sure we address today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... the main thing is just feeling like I'm not as efficient at work as I used to be. I stay late to catch up, but it's hard. Honestly, I don't know if it's just me getting older or if there's something else. And... I've been drinking a bit more, but it's just to unwind, you know? My husband says I need to 'take a break,' but I can't afford to let things slip. It's just... systems errors, right? They can be patched."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like work stress and self-criticism are really wearing on you right now. How often have you been drinking to unwind, and have you noticed any effects on your work performance or relationships?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s... one glass most nights. Sometimes two. After work, you know? Just to quiet the noise. My husband says it\u2019s \u2018not healthy,\u2019 but I tell him it\u2019s efficiency\u2014wine as a temporary patch. I stay late to fix the leaks, but\u2026 I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s enough. The numbers in my head don\u2019t add up lately. I guess it\u2019s just\u2026 stress."}
