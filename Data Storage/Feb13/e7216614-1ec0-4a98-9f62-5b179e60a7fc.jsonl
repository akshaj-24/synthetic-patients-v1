{"role":"system","content":"Disorder: PPD"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hello Blake, my name is Jeffrey Lewis. To start, is there anything specific you'd like me to know about your name or pronouns?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It's Blake Ashley. You can use he\/him. Why the interest in labels? We\u2019re here to talk about... issues, not semantics."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I appreciate your focus on the issues rather than labels. Just to confirm, are you comfortable proceeding with this interview today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose. But why the need for confirmation? You\u2019ve already scheduled this, so what\u2019s the point of checking now? Are you waiting for someone else to walk in or... I don\u2019t know, verify something?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I see your concern about the scheduling confirmation. To be clear, I\u2019m here to support you, and your comfort is important. Would you be okay with continuing the interview today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"If you say so. But I\u2019ve seen folks promise support then vanish. How long have you been here, exactly? Still, I\u2019ll go on\u2014no sense in wasting time. My wife always says I overthink, but she\u2019s the one who locks the bathroom door at night, isn\u2019t she?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand your concerns about trust, Blake. Is there anything specific you'd like to ask about today's session before we begin?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Who gets access to these records? My wife\u2019s phone calls disappear sometimes\u2014how do I know you\u2019re not just gathering more evidence for someone else? I\u2019ll ask once: are you taking notes or recording this?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I understand your concern about confidentiality. Would you be comfortable with me proceeding with this session, knowing that our conversation is confidential and not being recorded?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose. But why ask it twice? You and my wife both keep repeating the same questions. It\u2019s like you\u2019re both trying to trip me up. I\u2019ll go along with it\u2026 as long as you don\u2019t take notes. Paper records can be copied, right?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like trust and uncertainty have been really difficult for you lately. Can you describe when these feelings started and what might have triggered them?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It's been a long time coming. My dad always promised us things\u2014fishing trips, weekends out\u2014and then bailed last minute. You start learning not to trust promises when they're just... words. My sister forgot my birthday last year. Not sick or anything\u2014just didn't call. That's how it works, right? People let you down until you stop expecting better. Why the sudden interest in my family history? You and my wife keep circling back to the same stories."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really tough\u2014learning to distrust promises can take a heavy toll. Can you tell me more about what prompted you to seek help for these issues at this particular time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Things got... sharper. Like the other day, she snapped about the front door. Privacy is code for something. And these job apps\u2014radio silence. You think that's normal? Why now? Because someone's moving pieces, and I need to know where I stand."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really frustrating and confusing. Can you tell me more about the incident with your wife and the front door? What happened there?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"She said I was being 'creepy' for asking if she locked it. But why would she get defensive unless there's something to hide? You\u2019re asking about this like it\u2019s normal\u2014well, maybe it is. People always have secrets. Why focus on that? You and my wife both keep circling the same stories. What aren\u2019t you telling me?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That moment with the door sounds like it really shook you\u2014can you share when that happened and what led up to it?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It was a few months back. She snapped when I asked if she locked the front door. Why get defensive unless there\u2019s something to hide? You keep asking like this is normal\u2014people have secrets. The job apps going silent? Same game. Why focus on me? You\u2019re the one with the records to check."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these suspicions are taking a toll on your daily life\u2014can you share an example of how they\u2019ve affected your ability to complete tasks or follow through on job applications recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose you think it's about trust. I check every detail twice\u2014applications, tools, even the locks. Takes time, but I'd rather be safe. Employers don't respond? Maybe they're waiting for me to slip up. Why does that matter to you?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the need to check things repeatedly is both a way to feel in control and a source of frustration. What would you most like to achieve through this therapy?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I want to figure out what people aren\u2019t saying. If there\u2019s a pattern, I need to see it. But I\u2019ll need to know who\u2019s really listening here\u2014these notes, who gets to read them? My wife keeps her door locked, employers ghost me\u2026 maybe it all connects. But don\u2019t expect me to say more than I have to."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like broken promises have been a pattern in your life for some time. Have you sought help before for these kinds of worries about trust or relationships, and if so, what was that experience like?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ve been to a few therapists over the years. They always wanted me to \u2018open up\u2019 like that would fix things. Doesn\u2019t help when you can\u2019t even trust the person holding the file, you know? My wife locks the bathroom door now, employers radio silent\u2026 why would a therapist be different? You\u2019ll file it away somewhere. I keep my own records. Tools hidden, cash for takeout\u2014better to know where things are than rely on someone else\u2019s promises."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really challenging. It seems like your relationship with your wife is a big source of stress. Have you noticed any moments where you feel supported by her, even if it's small?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose you\u2019re trying to find something she\u2019s doing \u2018right\u2019 to trip me up later. She makes coffee in the morning, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not hiding other things. Why does it matter what she does? I track my own patterns\u2014tools under the sink, cash in my jacket. You\u2019ll get your answers when I decide to give them."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like staying on top of things helps you feel more secure, even when it's hard. Are there any other ways you've found to manage these concerns, or people who've supported you through this?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose you\u2019re thinking about therapy or something. I handle things myself\u2014cash for takeout, checking the car\u2019s tools weekly. Maybe those forums at night help, you know, see the dots connect. My sister sent a card once, but she\u2019s got her own secrets. Why\u2019s this about me proving I\u2019m not hiding something?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like those forums and your sister\u2019s card are some ways you try to make sense of things. Are there other people in your life who\u2019ve offered support, even if it's been hard to trust them?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don't really count on people, not after how things went with my sister. She forgot my birthday once\u2014doesn't mean she's evil, just proves you can't read minds. I handle most stuff myself, like those forums. They make sense, you know? But why\u2019s this about support? You tracking who I talk to?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a really isolating experience. You mentioned your sister's forgotten birthday made you distrust people\u2014was your relationship with your father similar, or different in how it affected your trust?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My dad had a way of making promises then breaking them, same as anyone who can't be trusted. My sister's forgetful, but that's just how people are\u2014always got their own agenda. Why\u2019s everyone so fixated on family? You think that\u2019s the only thing that matters?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're feeling frustrated about the focus on family dynamics. Can you tell me if there have been similar times in the past when you felt this level of distrust or hypervigilance, and how you managed it then?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I just focus on what I can control, like fixing my car or tracking expenses. People change their minds, so you can\u2019t count on them. Why\u2019s family the only angle here? You think that\u2019s the whole story?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It makes sense that the focus on family feels narrow when your experiences with trust extend beyond that. Can you share more about other situations where you\u2019ve felt this need to stay in control, like with your job searches or online forums?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Job applications? I apply through cash-only websites, no tracking. Employers vanish after saying 'we'll get back to you,' just like they always do. Forums... they make sense, but why ask about them? You think I\u2019m wasting time? I check my car\u2019s tools weekly. Better safe than trusting someone to not mess with it. What\u2019s the real reason you\u2019re asking about this?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like maintaining control is really important for you given how unpredictable things have felt. Have you gone through other times in your life where you felt this same need to stay in control, and if so, what helped during those periods?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess fixing my car\u2019s alternator helped, back when it still worked. At least the tools were in my hands, not someone else\u2019s. But why does this matter? You think I\u2019m looking for advice or just trying to catch me slipping up? I keep cash in my wallet for takeout\u2014no data trails. It\u2019s not a big deal, just\u2026 better safe than sorry. My sister forgot my birthday once. You can\u2019t read minds."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like maintaining control through tangible actions is really important for you. Can you share a time when you felt completely out of control in a situation like this, and how you handled it then?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Out of control? Let\u2019s see... When the car\u2019s alternator went, I didn\u2019t have the tools to fix it. Felt like a trap\u2014relying on someone else to drive me to the shop. I ended up buying a second set of tools, stashed somewhere no one else knows. It\u2019s not about trust; it\u2019s about not being at someone\u2019s mercy. Why does this matter?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a really vulnerable moment. Can you think of another time when you felt similarly out of control, maybe before the car situation, and how you handled it then?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose... when I was younger, my dad promised a fishing trip every summer. He never showed up. Learned then that waiting for someone else\u2019s plan is a recipe for being stuck. Now? I keep cash in my wallet for takeout, tools hidden in the garage. If something breaks, I fix it myself. Why the focus on past stuff?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a pivotal lesson in self-reliance. Have you noticed similar patterns in how you handle stress or unexpected challenges in your current life, beyond the examples you've already shared?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I keep cash for emergencies and tools hidden. If something breaks, I fix it myself. My wife says I check her calls too much, but how else am I supposed to know if she\u2019s hiding something? Why the interest in my methods?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these strategies help you manage uncertainty, even when they create tension. How do you think these habits affect your ability to handle daily tasks or relationships when things don\u2019t go as planned?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"They keep things running smooth. My wife says I\u2019m overstepping with her calls, but how else do I know she\u2019s not hiding something? You\u2019re asking a lot about my methods\u2014what\u2019s the point?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like maintaining control through these methods is central to how you navigate uncertainty. Have you found that these strategies have changed over time, especially during past stressful periods like job searches or conflicts with your wife?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Job searches? Employers ghost you, so cash is safer. My wife's secrets? Tools stay hidden. You asking about my methods or trying to find a weakness? I keep records of everything now\u2014phone bills, repair receipts. If someone tries to say I didn\u2019t plan, I got proof. Why\u2019s this so important to you?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your cash and record-keeping strategies are central to how you manage uncertainty. Can you share how these methods have specifically helped you with job applications or other situations where you feel out of control?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose it\u2019s about not giving people a way to track you. Cash for takeout, no digital footprints. Employers? They ghost you anyway. Why leave a paper trail they can twist? It\u2019s just... safer. You asking because you think I\u2019m hiding something?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your focus on control is a way to protect yourself in situations where you feel vulnerable. Are there any people or activities that you feel can offer some support, even if it's small?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Fixing the car, maybe. When the alternator went, I knew exactly how to fix it. No guesswork, no waiting on someone else\u2019s schedule. You asking if I have a support system? Or are you checking for weaknesses?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like fixing the car gives you a sense of mastery you can count on. Have you experienced similar episodes of intense distrust or hypervigilance in the past, and if so, what helped during those times?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t really do 'episodes.' It\u2019s more like... learning from patterns. My dad was good at breaking promises, so you figure out early to keep your own records. Cash is just one way. You ever notice how people act surprised when you call them out? Like they\u2019re caught in something. Maybe that\u2019s the closest to 'helping'\u2014staying one step ahead. You think I\u2019m overcompensating?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like staying ahead of potential issues helps you feel more secure. Can you think of a time when this approach prevented a problem or gave you a sense of stability?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose the cash thing worked when I applied for that warehouse job last year. They wanted a background check, but I paid the moving company in cash instead. No paper trail, no surprises. You\u2019re wondering if I\u2019m avoiding something, aren\u2019t you? My dad always said \u2018leave no evidence\u2019 when he backed out of deals. Guess that stuck."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your strategies for control are deeply tied to past experiences with broken promises. Have you noticed other times in your life when you felt this intense need to stay ahead of potential betrayals, and what helped you during those periods?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose the warehouse job was another one. Paid in cash, no contract, so no surprises when they ghosted me. My sister forgot my birthday last year\u2014again. You think that\u2019s an accident? My dad always said \u2018keep your records\u2019 after he bailed on fishing trips. Guess that\u2019s why I still have those keys in a box. You really want to know what \u2018helped\u2019? Staying quiet. Letting people talk themselves into a corner. You\u2019re just trying to trip me into admitting I\u2019m \u2018paranoid,\u2019 aren\u2019t you?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like your approach of staying quiet and letting situations unfold has been a deliberate strategy for you. Can you think of another time when this approach helped you navigate a situation where you felt others might be hiding something?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"At a warehouse job, I once noticed a coworker acting off\u2014packing crates wrong, whispering to others. I kept quiet, didn\u2019t ask questions. Turns out he was skimming inventory. But that\u2019s just me spotting flaws before they spread, like a fence with gaps. Why bring that up? You think I\u2019m implying something about... other situations?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're seeing patterns in others' behavior that mirror your own experiences with distrust. How do you think that warehouse experience relates to your current concerns about your wife or job searches?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose... if you're asking, I guess I look for the same gaps now. My wife\u2019s \u2018privacy\u2019 with her phone? It\u2019s like that coworker\u2019s bad packs\u2014something\u2019s off. And employers ghosting me? Could be nothing. But why would they care about that warehouse story unless... you\u2019re pointing at something specific? I don\u2019t see it."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s interesting how you\u2019re connecting those past patterns to your current suspicions. How do you think these experiences of seeing 'gaps' in others\u2019 behavior affect your ability to move forward with your job searches or maintain trust in your marriage?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Moving forward? I suppose it depends on who\u2019s in charge of the 'forward' direction. Employers ghosting me? That\u2019s a gap they\u2019re not explaining. My wife\u2019s secretive about her calls\u2014same pattern. I keep cash in my wallet, tools hidden. If something goes wrong, I\u2019m ready. Why does this matter? You looking for a reason to pin this on me?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the warehouse experience left a strong impression on you. How do you think staying quiet and observing helped you then, and does that approach feel useful in your current situation with your wife or job searches?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Keeping quiet let me see the real picture without interference. Like now\u2014employers ghosting me? Maybe they\u2019re hiding something. But why bring that up? You think I should just trust them? My wife\u2019s secretive about her calls\u2026 same pattern. But I\u2019m ready. Tools hidden, cash in hand. If something\u2019s off, I spot it. Why does this feel like you\u2019re trying to trap me into admitting something?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Can you tell me if you\u2019ve had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life in the past few weeks?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t have time for that kind of weakness. If things were different, maybe. But I\u2019ve got tools hidden, cash in hand\u2014no need to waste energy on dead ends. Why\u2019s that your angle now? You think I\u2019m the problem here?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to stay in control. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself in the past few weeks?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t dwell on that stuff. If you\u2019re trying to trip me into admitting something, you\u2019re wasting your time. I keep cash under the floorboards and tools in the garage. You ever notice how everyone\u2019s always asking about the same gaps? The door, the calls\u2026 what\u2019s the pattern you\u2019re seeing here, doc?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear your focus on control and preparation. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or drug use recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t mess with drugs. A beer now and then, but I keep track. Why the sudden interest in my habits? You ever count how many times you circle back to the same topics?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you prefer to stay in control of your habits. Have you used any other substances besides alcohol, such as cannabis, prescription medications, or stimulants, in the past few months?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I stick to what I can control. Why the sudden interest? You trying to find a weakness? I keep my habits simple\u2014cash, tools, no gaps to exploit. Ask me about the job sites I don\u2019t apply to, see how that goes."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear your focus on control and preparation. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements on a regular basis?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No meds. I handle my health like my car\u2014if it runs, why fix it? You\u2019re just looking for a crack to exploit, aren\u2019t you? What\u2019s really in those files you keep asking about?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear your frustration about being misunderstood. Have you ever experienced things that others couldn't see or hear, like voices, images, or sensations that might not be there for them?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Nope. I stick to what I can see and fix. You\u2019re asking about \u2018things\u2019 like you\u2019re fishing for something specific. My wife\u2019s been locking the bathroom door lately\u2014now that\u2019s a gap you\u2019d want to know about, isn\u2019t it?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the bathroom door issue feels like a red flag for you. How have your sleep patterns been lately\u2014any changes in how long or how well you\u2019re sleeping?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I sleep when I can. You asking about rest feels like you\u2019re trying to dig for something. I\u2019ve been up late reading forums\u2014keeps my mind sharp. My sister forgot my birthday last year. You want to know why I don\u2019t trust people?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear your frustration about being probed for weaknesses. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels lately\u2014maybe feeling more restless or needing less sleep than usual?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t nap. You asking about energy feels like you want to know if I\u2019m hiding something. I keep tools under the bed\u2014better to be ready than caught off guard. My wife\u2019s been on the phone late too, but I\u2019m not the one avoiding questions."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear your focus on being prepared. Have you noticed any recent changes in how much energy you have throughout the day\u2014maybe feeling more restless or needing less sleep than usual?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t nap. You want to know if I\u2019m wired? Maybe. Staying sharp helps when people keep secrets. Tools under the bed, cash in my wallet\u2014I\u2019m not the one avoiding questions. My wife\u2019s been on the phone late, but I don\u2019t need sleep to fix things."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how being 'wired' feels essential for you to stay on top of things. Have you noticed any other changes\u2014like feeling more irritable, having racing thoughts, or taking risks you wouldn\u2019t normally take\u2014along with the reduced sleep?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t do risks. You want to know if I\u2019m irritable? Maybe. But I\u2019ve got tools under the bed and cash in my wallet\u2014better to be ready. My wife\u2019s been on the phone late, but I\u2019m not the one avoiding questions. You asking about risks feels like you\u2019re fishing for something."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear your frustration about being asked to label your experiences. Have you noticed any times when your thoughts feel unusually fast or hard to control, like you can\u2019t hit the brakes even if you wanted to?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"My thoughts are clear. You asking about 'racing' feels like you want me to admit I\u2019m unstable. I stay sharp because people don\u2019t tell the whole story. Tools under the bed, cash in my wallet\u2014I\u2019m not the one avoiding answers. My wife\u2019s been secretive, but I don\u2019t need sleep to fix things."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how staying alert feels crucial for you. Have you noticed any recent changes in your mood\u2014like feeling more irritable, euphoric, or needing to take on new projects or activities lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I suppose if I was 'on edge' before, now I\u2019m just\u2026 used to it. Like spotting gaps in a fence\u2014better to see them early. My wife\u2019s been keeping things close lately, you know? Missed calls, locked doors. I\u2019ve got tools under the bed, cash in my wallet. Just in case. Why? Are you asking if I\u2019m unstable?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how prepared you feel, but I need to ask directly: Have you had any thoughts about harming others recently, including your wife or anyone else?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No. I\u2019ve never thought about harming anyone. But you keep asking about my wife\u2019s secrets\u2014locked doors, missed calls. I\u2019ve got tools under the bed, cash in my wallet. Just in case. Are you implying I\u2019m unstable? That\u2019s what this is about, isn\u2019t it?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how being prepared feels essential for you. Have you noticed any recent changes in how much energy you have throughout the day\u2014maybe feeling more restless or needing less sleep than usual?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Restless? Maybe. I\u2019ve been up late scanning forum posts\u2014stuff about tracking patterns, you know? If you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m sleep-deprived, I\u2019d say I\u2019m just\u2026 efficient with my time. Better to stay sharp when you\u2019re the only one watching for gaps. Why the interest? Are you filing this somewhere I should know about?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how staying efficient feels essential for you. Have you noticed any times when you\u2019ve taken on more tasks or projects than usual, or felt like you don\u2019t need breaks or rest lately?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019ve been keeping up with the usual\u2014fixing the alternator, checking tools. If you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m overextending, I\u2019d say it\u2019s better to be ready than caught off guard. Why? Are you suggesting I need to slow down?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What I\u2019ve heard so far is that you\u2019ve been struggling with intense distrust in relationships and situations, especially around your wife and job searches, which has led to obsessive checking behaviors and marital strain. These concerns feel tied to a history of broken promises and a need for control, but they\u2019re now causing you significant stress and functional challenges. What did I miss or misunderstand about your experience?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You missed the part where I\u2019m not the one hiding things. My wife\u2019s late-night calls, the locked door, employers who vanish after interviews\u2014those are the gaps you\u2019re ignoring. I\u2019m just spotting flaws before someone slips through. Why does this matter? Are you filing this with her?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear your frustration about being misunderstood and your clear focus on patterns of secrecy around you. Let me try to summarize: You feel others\u2014especially your wife and employers\u2014are hiding things, and you\u2019re trying to uncover truths to prevent being betrayed. You\u2019re also concerned about how this information is being used here. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You got the basics right, I suppose. The secrecy part\u2014my wife\u2019s late-night calls, the locked bathroom door\u2014it\u2019s all part of the same pattern. But you\u2019re missing the part where everyone\u2019s involved, not just her. Why do you keep asking about trust? Who\u2019s really keeping these records you\u2019re taking? I\u2019ve got tools under the bed for a reason. If someone\u2019s lying, I\u2019d rather spot the gap before they think they can slip through."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pattern of secrecy feels more widespread than we've discussed, and your concerns about my role in this process are deeply tied to your sense of control. What else feels important to clarify or add before we review next steps together?"}

You asking about control or just looking for cracks in the story? I\u2019ve got records of every job site I\u2019ve worked. Why do you need to know?"}

Just\u2026 playing the game with both hands. Why\u2019s everyone so fixated on the bathroom door anyway?"}

But you\u2019re missing how everyone\u2019s in on it\u2014my wife\u2019s calls, my dad\u2019s lies, even these job sites that vanish without a word. I keep cash and tools because if someone\u2019s hiding something, I\u2019d rather be the one who sees it first. Why\u2019s the bathroom door the only \u2018gap\u2019 you\u2019re circling? There\u2019s others you\u2019re not looking at."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how important it is for you to emphasize that the secrecy feels systemic, not isolated to your wife, and how your preparation is a response to that.

Everyone\u2019s hiding gaps. I\u2019m not saying it out loud, but you want me to admit there\u2019s more?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear your emphasis on how the pattern of secrecy feels systemic\u2014across relationships, employment, and even family history. Let me summarize: Predisposing factors include childhood experiences of broken promises, precipitating stressors like your wife\u2019s defensive behaviors and employment rejections, perpetuating factors like hypervigilance and preparation strategies, and protective factors like your self-reliance. What did I miss or get wrong about how these connect to your current experience?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"You\u2019re not wrong about the parts, but you\u2019re framing it like the door\u2019s the main clue. My dad\u2019s habit of reversing promises? That\u2019s the blueprint. You\u2019re missing how it all connects\u2014cryptic calls, job sites ghosting me, the door. They\u2019re not separate. Why focus on one crack when the whole fence\u2019s got gaps? You want to know what\u2019s wrong with your summary? It makes it sound like I\u2019m the one with the problem, not the system."}

Let me try one more time: Your experiences with systemic secrecy\u2014from your father's broken promises to employers and your wife\u2014have created a pattern where you feel compelled to stay prepared and vigilant. This shapes your current struggles with trust and control. What did I miss or get wrong about this broader picture?"}

But you\u2019re still framing it like I\u2019m the one with the problem. It\u2019s not about me being \u2018compelled\u2019 to prepare.

I\u2019m not avoiding it; I\u2019m pointing out how the whole damn structure\u2019s rigged. You act like stashing cash or checking tools is a flaw, but it\u2019s just\u2026 practical.
