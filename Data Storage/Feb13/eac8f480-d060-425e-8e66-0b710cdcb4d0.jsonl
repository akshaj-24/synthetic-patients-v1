{"role":"system","content":"Disorder: GAD"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hello, Ms. Evans. My name is William Wood, and I'll be conducting this psychiatric interview with you today. Before we begin, could you please confirm your name and let me know if you have any pronoun preferences? This will help ensure we're comfortable and respectful moving forward."}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s Emily. Emily Evans. Pronouns are\u2026 she\/her. Yeah, that\u2019s the usual. I, uh\u2026 I should probably be more organized about this stuff. Paperwork\u2019s always a mess for me, you know? Always second-guessing if I got the right forms for work\u2026 or anything, really."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Emily, thank you for sharing that. Just to clarify, today\u2019s session will involve discussing your current concerns and how we might support you moving forward. Does that sound okay to you, and do you have any questions before we begin?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Yeah, sounds okay. I just\u2026 hope I don\u2019t ramble too much. My mind\u2019s like a leaky faucet these days. You ever try to fix a faucet? It\u2019s not just the drip, it\u2019s all the water you don\u2019t see building up. Work\u2019s been\u2026 intense. Paperwork, residents\u2019 meds\u2026 I double-check everything now. Can\u2019t shake the feeling I\u2019m one mistake away from\u2026 something bad."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really tough to carry alone. Would you be comfortable proceeding with our discussion today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2026 I suppose. As long as we don\u2019t get stuck on the\u2026 the big stuff. My mind\u2019s like a security system that\u2019s always half-armed\u2014beeping at shadows, you know? My hands get this\u2026 twitch when I\u2019m on edge. It\u2019s just\u2026 a lot to unpack, but I\u2019ll try to keep it straight."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. Would you be okay with us starting gently and proceeding at a pace that feels manageable for you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Sure, if we can\u2026 maybe start with the small checks? Like, the daily rounds? My hands are twitching again, but I can steady them if I focus. It\u2019s like with residents\u2014you just keep checking the rails, even when you\u2019re tired. As long as we don\u2019t\u2026 lose the signal, you know?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That metaphor about staying steady through small checks is powerful. Would you be okay with us proceeding at a pace that feels manageable for you, step by step?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I want to believe that, but it\u2019s like when I\u2019m on night shift. I tell myself to just check the rails once, but my hands keep going back, you know? The logs, the schedules\u2014it\u2019s not that I\u2019m doing it wrong, it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t let me *stop*. Even now, my fingers are... jittery. I guess I\u2019m just worried we\u2019ll get to \u2018step by step\u2019 and I\u2019ll already have fallen behind, somehow."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really challenging to manage alongside our conversation. Would you be okay with us taking one step at a time together, checking in as we go?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I want to try. It\u2019s just\u2014my hands are still shaking a little, like they\u2019re arguing with me even as I nod. If we go step by step, will you... catch me if I skip a beat? I had a resident once who\u2019d hum to stay calm during transfusions. Do you think that\u2019s silly?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That\u2019s a thoughtful way to manage anxiety. Would you be comfortable trying a similar approach as we proceed step by step today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... I guess I could try humming. It\u2019s not like my hands are going to stop fidgeting anyway. It\u2019s just, you know, I\u2019ve always thought of these checks as... like the rails on a wheelchair. You keep adjusting them until they\u2019re *just right*, even if the chair\u2019s not moving. What if the hum makes me spaced out and I miss something important? But... if it helps my head quiet down for a minute, I\u2019m willing to give it a shot. Silly, right?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Can you tell me more about the main concerns that have been troubling you recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s... work stuff, mostly. The new electronic system\u2014it\u2019s like a vise half-turned whenever I\u2019m at the computer. I keep hitting the same keys over and over, just to be sure. And my dad\u2019s getting more... confused. You know how it is with dementia, the way memories just... dissolve. I lie awake counting the hours between shifts, wondering if my hands will stop jittering long enough to focus. But maybe that\u2019s just me, right? Overthinking again."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like these worries have been really persistent for you\u2014can you help me understand when you first noticed this level of anxiety at work and with your dad\u2019s condition?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think it started... maybe a few years back, during my training? There was this one day when the supervisor said I was 'overseeing everything' too much. I don\u2019t mean to, but it\u2019s like the rails on a wheelchair\u2014keep adjusting them until they\u2019re *perfect*, even if the chair\u2019s not moving. I\u2019ve always done that, but now... with the electronic system and Dad\u2019s dementia, it\u2019s like the vise just... tightened. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s 'normal' stress or if something\u2019s broken. Does that make sense?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure to be 'perfect' has been building for years, and now it\u2019s clashing with real-life challenges like your dad\u2019s dementia and the electronic system. How has this anxiety been affecting your relationship with your husband, especially with the adoption discussions you mentioned?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s... complicated. David\u2019s good, really. He just laughs when I burn the roast, you know? But the adoption stuff\u2014it\u2019s like trying to follow a recipe where half the steps are missing. I keep second-guessing every form, every email. Last week I snapped at him about the dishwasher because my head felt like it was full of static. He just held my hands and said, \u2018Breathe, Em.\u2019 But what if we\u2019re not good enough? What if the paperwork falters... and it\u2019s my fault?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the uncertainty around adoption is adding to your anxiety, especially with the fear that your stress might be causing strain in your marriage. What would you most hope to explore or change through this conversation today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... I just don\u2019t want to be so... so tense all the time. The thing with David\u2014it\u2019s not that he minds the dishwasher or the burnt roast, I think. It\u2019s that I feel like I\u2019m carrying this weight, and it\u2019s spilling over. If I could just... find a system that doesn\u2019t require checking every step five times, that would help. But I don\u2019t even know where to start. Or if it\u2019s even possible."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the pressure to perfect tasks is really weighing on you. Can you share what strategies you\u2019ve tried so far to manage the need to check things repeatedly?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I try... humming, sometimes. It helps my hands stop jittering for a minute. Breaking things into steps, like just checking the rails once before moving on... but what if I miss something? At work, the electronic system\u2014it\u2019s like a new kind of rail, but I keep second-guessing every click. David says I\u2019m doing enough, but my head won\u2019t let up. It\u2019s like... the vise just tightens when I think I\u2019m getting it right."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really frustrating, like trying to hold everything together while the vise keeps tightening. When did you first notice the anxiety and checking behaviors starting to worsen compared to how they were a few years ago?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... the past year really tipped it. Dad\u2019s diagnosis, the new electronic system at work\u2014everything just feels like it\u2019s... snowballing. Before that, I could at least tell myself I was in control, you know? Now the checking... it\u2019s not even enough to do it once. My hands are always twitching, like they\u2019re expecting a mistake to leap out at them. The adoption stuff, too\u2014it\u2019s not just the forms. It\u2019s like the vise gets tighter every time I second-guess something, and I\u2019m scared David\u2019s just... used to me being this way by now."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like this anxiety has been building up over time\u2014have you experienced similar periods of overwhelming worry or stress in the past, and if so, what helped during those times?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"There was... the nursing assistant training. My supervisor said I was 'overseeing everything,' which sounded good, but it made me scared of slipping up. I worked harder, but it\u2019s like... the vise just learned to tighten faster. Now, even small things\u2014like the adoption forms\u2014feel like they could crack under my grip. David says I\u2019m not alone, but my hands still jitter when I try to sign anything."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really tough\u2014like your anxiety learned to outpace your efforts to manage it. When you were in that training period before, what specific strategies or supports helped you feel more stable, even if just briefly?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Honestly? I\u2019d walk the unit twice before shifts, memorizing every rail\u2019s position. It felt like\u2026 if I could control the small stuff, the rest wouldn\u2019t unravel. But the machine\u2014\"*the machine*\"\u2014it\u2019s different. No tactile checks. Just\u2026 numbers on a screen. My hands still cramp from gripping the mouse, even when I\u2019m alone. I tell myself it\u2019s just a system, but what if I miss a decimal? What if David\u2019s forms get lost in the same static? I\u2014uh\u2014maybe I\u2019m overcomplicating."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Can you tell me if you've had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No\u2014no, I don\u2019t think about *that*. Not directly. But sometimes\u2026 I\u2019ll catch myself staring at the sink, just wondering if the water\u2019s cold enough to wake me up. Like, *What if I don\u2019t pull myself back this time?* Then I laugh at myself, like it\u2019s some stupid joke. But my hands\u2026 they still tremble afterward. It\u2019s just the tide, you know? Stuck between the waves."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like those moments with the sink are both a struggle and a metaphor for feeling stuck. Have you ever considered that scenario as a way to hurt yourself, even if it feels like a joke?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No\u2014no, it\u2019s not a plan. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a stuck thought. Like when a resident gets confused about the time, but you can\u2019t reset their clock. The laugh\u2019s just\u2026 a shield. But my hands still shake afterward. It\u2019s not a joke, but it\u2019s not a choice either. It\u2019s the tide, again."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how that stuck thought with the sink feels both involuntary and unsettling. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use recently?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I don\u2019t use cannabis\u2014never really felt it would help. As for alcohol\u2026 I\u2019ll have a glass of wine maybe twice a week. Not to 'numb' or anything, just\u2026 to feel like I\u2019m not gripping everything so hard? But my hands still shake afterward. It\u2019s like the vise just learns a new shape. I guess?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the alcohol doesn\u2019t fully ease the tension you\u2019re carrying. Have you used any other substances, like stimulants or prescription medications, to cope with anxiety or physical symptoms like hand tremors?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No\u2014no other substances. I\u2019ve tried OTC sleep aids once, but they just leave me foggy. The wine\u2026 it\u2019s the only thing that helps me *unclench* a little. But my hands still shake. It\u2019s like the vise just\u2026 adapts. I guess?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the alcohol provides minimal relief but doesn't resolve the physical tension you're experiencing. Are you currently taking any prescription medications or supplements for anxiety, sleep, or other symptoms?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I\u2019m not on any prescriptions. I take melatonin sometimes\u2014maybe a couple times a month? But it\u2019s like\u2026 it helps me fall asleep, but the rest of the night I\u2019m still tangled up. My body\u2019s used to being on high alert, I guess. It\u2019s not like I can just flip a switch."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like sleep is a persistent challenge for you. Have you noticed any recent changes in how much sleep you're getting overall, or differences in your energy levels during the day\u2014like feeling more restless or wired than usual?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Lately, it\u2019s like my sleep\u2019s gotten\u2026 shorter, even when I\u2019m in bed the same amount of time. I wake up with this knot in my shoulders, like I\u2019ve been carrying a clipboard full of error messages. My hands still jitter a bit, even when I\u2019m not at work. I guess I\u2019m just\u2026 more wired? It\u2019s like the vise\u2019s learned to tighten itself while I\u2019m trying to rest."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the 'wired' feeling is both exhausting and persistent. Have you noticed any periods in the past where you felt unusually energetic or needed significantly less sleep than usual, even while staying up late?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, not really. When I\u2019m up late, it\u2019s more like my body\u2019s stuck on \u2018alert mode\u2019\u2014you know, checking things, rewiring the same fears. I\u2019m not *energetic*, just\u2026 tangled up. Like my hands are still jittering even when I\u2019m trying to rest. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got extra energy; it\u2019s more like the vise\u2019s keeping me awake instead of letting me catch my breath."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I hear how the racing thoughts feel overwhelming and persistent. Have you noticed any times when your mind feels especially fast or jumbled, like you\u2019re jumping between ideas quickly or having trouble focusing on one thing at a time?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s like\u2026 when you\u2019re trying to track three residents\u2019 meds and their activity schedules at the same time. My head feels like it\u2019s flipping between screens, but the fonts are all blurry. I\u2019ll be in the middle of a thought and suddenly catch myself rewiring the same worry loop\u2014like, *Did I save that form? Did I miss a dose?*\u2014and my hands start twitching again. But maybe that\u2019s just me being\u2026 over-organized?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like the physical symptoms you're describing are closely tied to your anxiety. Have you ever been diagnosed with a medical condition that might contribute to these physical symptoms, such as thyroid issues or sleep apnea?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, I don\u2019t think so. My primary care doc runs the usual blood work every year, and they\u2019ve never said anything about thyroid stuff\u2026 though I guess they could\u2019ve missed it? I mean, I\u2019ve always been \u2018tense,\u2019 like my mom was. Maybe it\u2019s just\u2026 how I\u2019m wired. It\u2019s not like I go in complaining\u2014when you work with residents, you learn to keep quiet about your own aches and jitters. But sometimes I wonder if there\u2019s something physical I\u2019m ignoring, like a hidden error in the system I can\u2019t spot."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It sounds like you've been managing a lot without medical intervention, but I want to check if there are any other symptoms that might be affecting you. Have you noticed any hallucinations, delusions, or thoughts that others are targeting you or trying to harm you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, nothing like that. I don\u2019t hear voices or think people are out to get me. But\u2026 my mind\u2019s always racing, you know? Like a vise that won\u2019t loosen. Sometimes my hands shake when I\u2019m at the computer\u2014typing reports, checking names twice\u2014what if I mix up a resident\u2019s meds? It\u2019s not hallucinations, but the worry\u2026 it\u2019s a physical thing. My shoulders are always knotted. I just\u2026 can\u2019t switch it off."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s clear how much you\u2019ve been carrying, Emily. Let\u2019s make sure we\u2019ve covered everything before we wrap up\u2014do you have any final questions or concerns about what we\u2019ve discussed today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess... I just keep thinking about the electronic system at work. My hands still shake when I\u2019m entering data, even after all these checks. I worry I\u2019ll make a mistake that affects someone. And... adoption stuff is another thing that\u2019s tight in my chest, but maybe that\u2019s for another time."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds really challenging at work. Let's make sure we've covered everything\u2014do you have any final questions before we wrap up?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2026 I guess not. The machine at work still feels like a landmine sometimes\u2014my fingers freeze up even after double-checking everything. And the adoption stuff? It\u2019s just another thing that knots my chest, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s relevant here. Do we need to\u2026 unpack that? Or should we just\u2026 wrap up?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s okay to let the adoption concerns wait for another time if that feels manageable for you. Before we close, can you share how you\u2019d like to move forward with addressing these work and anxiety challenges\u2014what might help you feel more supported between now and our next session?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess\u2026 breaking the machine tasks into smaller steps might help. Like, just focusing on one screen at a time instead of the whole system. And maybe\u2026 if I could talk through the checks with someone? Not to sound dramatic, but my hands still freeze up even after double-checking. As for the rest\u2026 baking\u2019s been a weird escape, forcing myself into the \u2018knead until it\u2019s smooth\u2019 routine. But the adoption stuff? It\u2019s another rail I keep tightening, even when I know I should let it rest. I don\u2019t know. Maybe that\u2019s just\u2026 private?"}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"It\u2019s reassuring to hear you\u2019re experimenting with strategies to manage the workload. Before we close, is there anything else you\u2019d like to address today before we plan our next steps?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I think... maybe focusing on the machine one step at a time will help. But the adoption paperwork... it\u2019s like another resident I can\u2019t stop checking on, even when I know I should let it rest. My hands still jitter when I\u2019m on the computer, though. Do you think... maybe talking through it more could help? Or is that just being weak?"}
