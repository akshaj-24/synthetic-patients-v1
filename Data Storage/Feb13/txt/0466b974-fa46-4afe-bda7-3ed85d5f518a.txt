system: Session 0466b974-fa46-4afe-bda7-3ed85d5f518a transcript

system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Hello Kristin, my name is Erin Olson. To start, how would you like me to address you? (e.g., Kristin, Kris, or another name/pronouns if preferred)

patient: Kristin, please. Kristin Watts. My partner teases me about being too formal, but... I guess it’s just how I roll. You know, like how I label all the containers in the fridge. Overkill, but it keeps the chaos at bay.

interviewer: Kristin, it sounds like having routines helps you manage stress. Would you be comfortable moving forward with today's interview?

patient: Yes, I mean, I’ve already checked the thermostat settings three times since we started. It’s just... part of the process, right? My basil plant would call it ‘overwatering’ if it could, but here we are. Let’s get this done.

interviewer: Kristin, I appreciate your willingness to engage. Today, we’ll briefly discuss your concerns to understand what you’re experiencing—this usually takes about 45 minutes. Does that sound okay, or is there anything you’d like to clarify first?

patient: Sure, 45 minutes sounds... efficient. Like a system check, you know? I just hope we don’t hit a power outage mid-session. My shoulders are already hunched like I’m bracing for wind. But as long as we’re not discussing my landlord’s repair delays, we’ll be golden. My basil plant would call this ‘moderate stress levels’—it’s survived worse.

interviewer: That sounds manageable. Do you have any initial questions about today’s session, or are you comfortable moving forward?

patient: I think we’re good to proceed. I just... had to adjust my posture, you know? My shoulders have this habit of becoming human parentheses, always closing in. But I’ll power through. No system crashes here... probably. My partner says I’m a ‘walking maintenance checklist,’ but they love me anyway. Let’s get this audit done.

interviewer: It sounds like this level of stress and worry has been building for some time. Can you tell me when you first noticed these feelings of overwhelm and anxiety starting?

patient: Honestly? I’ve always had that ‘system check’ thing—like, if the thermostat’s off by a degree or my to-do list isn’t… *alphabetized*, I notice it. Feels normal to me, though. The basil plant’s the one with the real stress, probably. It’s… thriving? I think? (small laugh) I’m not great at reading plants.

interviewer: It seems like these checks are part of your routine—have you noticed them becoming more time-consuming or stressful recently, or is there a specific moment when they started feeling unmanageable?

patient: Honestly? The checks... they’re like a maintenance checklist. If I don’t run through them, it’s like leaving a valve open. My partner jokes about it—says I’m ‘HVAC-ing’ my life. But lately? Yeah, I’m tired. Not the good kind. Like, my brain’s stuck on ‘diagnostic mode’ even when I’m trying to unwind. But the basil’s still alive, so… I must be doing something right.

interviewer: It sounds like the mental exhaustion is a new layer to your usual routine. When did this feeling of being 'stuck on diagnostic mode' first start to interfere with your ability to relax or sleep?

patient: Honestly? It’s like… the ‘diagnostic mode’ thing ramped up maybe six months ago? Maybe? I can’t pin it down exactly. I just started needing to check the thermostat *and* the smoke alarm *and* the… uh… the fridge temp when I go to bed. Even after I’m asleep, I wake up thinking about it. My partner says I toss and turn like a sleep-robot in a malfunction loop. (pauses, then softens with a small chuckle) The basil? It’s fine. Probably judges me silently.

interviewer: It sounds like the checking rituals and sleep disturbances have become significant stressors. What would you like to achieve through this session or in terms of support moving forward?

patient: I guess I’m hoping to... fine-tune the system? Like, not let the checks overload the circuit. And maybe actually sleep through the basil’s silent judgment. (small smile) My partner says I need a ‘maintenance manual’ for stress—so, you know, practical tips over... panic protocols.

interviewer: It sounds like balancing these routines with your work and relationship is a challenge. Can you share an example of how these checking rituals or sleep issues have affected your work or relationship with your partner recently?

patient: Honestly? Last week I was so wired from all the checking I accidentally recalibrated the office thermostat to 78°F instead of 72. My boss didn’t laugh—just said, ‘Again?’ (small shrug) My partner’s been… hmm, I guess ‘frustrated’ isn’t too strong a word. They left a rom-com on in the background last night hoping it’d ‘override the diagnostic mode,’ but I just stared at the ceiling like a sleep-robot. (soft chuckle) The basil’s thriving, though. Probably smug.

interviewer: It sounds like the stress from work mistakes and relationship tension is adding to your burden. Have there been any recent changes or specific events that might be contributing to the increase in checking behaviors or sleep issues?

patient: At work, I’ve been double-checking the office thermostat more than usual—like, I’ll adjust it three times in an hour if the numbers feel ‘off.’ My boss gave me this look last week, like I’m some kind of… HVAC hypochondriac. And then at home, my partner keeps making those ‘maintenance checklist’ jokes, which I guess are funny, but they just keep looping in my head. I can’t even enjoy the basil plant without wondering if I’m overwatering it or something. It’s like my brain’s on a slow burn, you know? I’ve started having these dreams where the thermostat’s melting, and I wake up gripping my sheets so tight my hands cramp. Maybe that’s why I’ve been finishing my wine a little faster lately—employee wellness strategy, right?

interviewer: It sounds like the recent thermostat incident at work and your partner’s comments might be adding to the pressure you’re feeling. Have there been any other changes or specific events in the past few months that might be contributing to the increase in checking behaviors or the ‘slow burn’ anxiety you described?

patient: To be honest, I’ve been stressing about the budget more than usual. I started hiding some takeout receipts to keep from… overdoing it, you know? And my partner’s been coughing, which I’m sure is nothing, but it’s hard not to worry I’ll catch it too. It’s just little things piling up. I’ve been finishing my wine a bit faster lately—employee wellness strategy, right? But I still can’t sleep through the night. It’s like my brain’s on a slow burn, even when there’s nothing wrong.

interviewer: It sounds like these worries have been building up over time. Have you experienced periods in the past where your worries or checking habits became this intense?

patient: To be honest, I’ve always had a… ‘ Type A’ switch flicked on, you know? Like, even in college balancing labs and part-time shifts, I’d recheck my lab notes three times before submitting. But this—this feels like the basil plant during a drought. You can’t just water it once and walk away. My hands still cramp from gripping the sheets last week, even when I’m not dreaming about melting thermostats. I guess… I guess I’m just used to the low hum, but this is more like a car engine revving in neutral.

interviewer: It sounds like this intensity is new compared to your usual Type A tendencies. Have you had similar episodes where your worries or checking rituals became this overwhelming before, and if so, what helped you manage them at the time?

patient: I think… I think the thermostat thing is just the latest ‘project’ in a long list of stress testing. Back when I was managing the lab inventory, I’d recount supplies until my coworkers called me a… a ‘paranoid spreadsheet.’ But honestly, what helped? Baking. Overmixing the dough until my hands hurt, then forcing myself to laugh at the joke about ‘kneading stress out.’ Now? The wine and… talking myself out of hiding the basil plant’s ‘overwatering crisis’ in my head. It’s just… maintenance, right?

interviewer: It sounds like humor has been an important way you cope with stress. Who in your life has been a key support for you during these challenging times?

patient: My partner’s the main one, I guess. They… they make these jokes about turning me into a ‘checklist’ for everything, which is kind of annoying, but it keeps me from spiraling. And the basil plant? It’s weird, but taking care of it feels like… like a small project I can actually get right. Even if I overwater it sometimes. They also let me rant about the landlord’s delayed repairs, which sounds boring, but it’s… it’s grounding, I think. As long as we don’t talk about their cough too much. Or my wine consumption. Employee wellness strategy, right?

interviewer: It sounds like you're using wine to help manage stress. How often have you been drinking alcohol lately, and have you noticed any changes in your use compared to the past?

patient: To be honest, it’s pretty much one glass most nights. I call it ‘system maintenance’—you know, lubricating the gears to keep the whole machine running. It’s not like I’m… I don’t know, bingeing or anything. Though lately, when the basil looks like it’s throwing a hissy fit or my partner’s got that cough, I might crack open a second. But I’m sure that’s normal, right? I’ve just always done it. My mom used to drink tea like it was a duty, so maybe this is just… hereditary housekeeping?

interviewer: It sounds like alcohol has become a regular part of your routine to manage stress. Have you noticed any changes in your drinking habits recently, or does it feel like it’s starting to affect your daily life in any way?

patient: It’s… not exactly a new protocol, but maybe the ‘backup generator’ kicks in more when the basil looks like it’s staging a mutiny. My partner says I get ‘thermostat hands’—cramped, twitchy—so maybe the wine’s just… masking the static? But honestly, if I skipped it, would anyone even notice? My mom drank tea like it was a duty, right? Probably just… family tradition.

interviewer: It seems like alcohol is a way you cope with stress, similar to family patterns. Have you been using any other substances besides alcohol, such as cannabis, stimulants, or medications, either prescribed or over-the-counter?

patient: Honestly? Just the wine and maybe some ibuprofen for the tension headaches. My mom used to take aspirin like it was a part of her daily routine, so I guess it’s just… family tradition? I’m not exactly a pharmaceutical poster child, though. If it’s not breaking, why fix it?

interviewer: It sounds like you’re managing stress through routine and humor. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life, even if just in passing?

patient: No, I haven’t… I mean, it’s not like I’m programming an exit strategy or anything. My brain’s more of a… stuck loop, you know? Like the basil plant—when it gets stressed, it just drops leaves instead of, I don’t know, combusting. I guess I’d rather fix the soil than uproot everything. My partner’s laugh still works like a reset button, though. Even if I’m halfway through a meltdown about the thermostat, their ‘rom-com voice’ pops in and… well, it’s not dramatic. Just… not that kind of broken.

interviewer: I appreciate how you describe finding balance through your partner's support. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic, need less sleep, or have rapid thoughts that are hard to slow down?

patient: No, I don’t think so. My brain’s more of a… stuck loop, you know? Like an overloaded circuit. My partner says I get ‘thermostat hands’ when I’m stressed, but energy-wise? I’m more… drained. Wine helps me unwind, but even then, my thoughts keep running like a system check. Though I guess that’s just my baseline now.

interviewer: It sounds like alcohol is a consistent part of your routine, even if it feels normalized. Have you noticed any changes in how you feel when you drink—like if it’s helping more or less than before, or if there are times you feel you *need* it to get through the day?

patient: It’s… an employee wellness strategy, right? I mean, one glass. But lately, it’s like the wine needs a *second* glass to even register. My partner teases that I’m turning into a corkscrew—tight, spirally, stuck. Though the basil plant still perks up after I water it, so… maybe I’m just overthinking. Or under-watering.

interviewer: It sounds like your drinking has increased slightly lately. Have you noticed any physical effects or changes in how you feel the next day when you drink more than one glass?

patient: Honestly? My head feels like a thermostat set to ‘meltdown’ if I go past one. Last week, after two glasses, my hands were shaking so bad I spilled coffee on the maintenance log—my boss still laughs about it. But the next day? Just… heavy. Like my bones are made of wet concrete. I tell myself it’s ‘system recalibration,’ but my partner says I just look like a sleep-deprived potted plant. Which, okay, the basil *did* need pruning that day…

interviewer: It sounds like alcohol’s effects are becoming harder to ignore lately. Have you been using any other substances besides wine and ibuprofen—like cannabis, energy drinks, or prescription medications—to manage stress or symptoms?

patient: To be honest, I’m more of a… caffeine and coffee dependency kind of gal? My partner jokes that I could power a small city on my morning espresso alone. But the coffee’s just… part of the system, right? Keeps the gears turning. The basil plant gets sunlight, I get my espresso—everyone’s calibrated. Though… I guess I do chug a lot of water too. Hydration’s a maintenance thing. You know how it is.

interviewer: It seems coffee is a key part of your daily routine. Have you been using any other substances besides coffee, wine, and ibuprofen—such as cannabis, energy drinks, or prescription medications—to manage stress or symptoms?

patient: No, I don’t touch anything else. Coffee’s my baseline, wine’s the ‘system patch,’ and ibuprofen’s just… the error code for bad days. My partner says I’m like a vintage printer—constant hum, occasional paper jams, but always ‘processing.’ Though honestly? I’d rather water my basil than experiment with anything else. It’s got enough problems without me adding variables.

interviewer: It sounds like you rely on a few key substances for routine maintenance. Are you currently taking any prescribed medications or supplements, either for health reasons or as part of your daily routine?

patient: No prescriptions—just the usual OTC stuff. My doctor once suggested a multivitamin, but I forgot to pick it up. I’m more of a… ‘let the basil plant be my pharmacist’ kind of gal. My partner says I’m like a DIY wellness kit—duct tape and hope. Though honestly? If my hands stop trembling during system checks, I’ll consider it a win.

interviewer: Let me check what I have so far: You’ve described feeling overwhelmed by constant worries about work, your partner’s health, and financial stability, which has led to sleep problems and physical tension. You also mentioned checking rituals around the thermostat and other routines, along with increased wine use to manage stress. Does this capture your main concerns, or is there something I’ve missed?

patient: That’s… pretty much it. I guess I’d add the basil plant? It’s weird, but if I can keep that alive, it feels like I’m not completely failing at… something. And maybe the coughing? My partner’s been doing that a lot, and I keep recalibrating my worry dial like it’s a thermostat. Ugh, there I go again—system checks for everything. It’s just… noisy in here sometimes.

interviewer: It sounds like the basil plant and these system-checking patterns are both a source of control and a way your mind stays 'noisy'—I’ll make note of that. Let me try to piece this together: Over the past six months, worries about work, your partner’s health, and financial stability have intensified, leading to sleep trouble, physical tension, and checking rituals (like thermostat adjustments or over-caring for the plant). These routines started as ways to manage stress but now feel overwhelming, even affecting your focus at work and relationships. Does that align with your experience, or is there something I’ve missed?

patient: Yeah, that’s… that’s pretty much it. The basil thing is just… it’s a stupid little thing, but if I can’t even keep that alive, what’s the point of all the checking? And the coughing—ugh, I keep waiting for it to get worse, like some kind of… warning light. My boss said I’ve been ‘distracted’ at work, which is just another way of saying I’m overdoing it. I guess I’m just… tired of being tired. But don’t get me wrong, I’m fine. Really. The wine helps, though. Mostly. My hands still cramp sometimes, but I tell myself it’s just… thermostat hands.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight of these worries and rituals is wearing on you more than you let on, especially with the fatigue and physical tension. What did I miss or get wrong in that summary?

patient: I mean, you got the basics right—the basil plant’s a… a stupid tiny project, but if it dies, I’ll feel like I’m failing at *all* the systems. And the wine? It’s not what it used to be. Used to be one glass was enough to mute the static, now it’s like… turning up the volume on a broken speaker. Oh, and my partner’s coughing—it’s driving me to check *everything* like maybe I can recalibrate their lungs or something. Absurd, right? I just… I guess I’m tired of feeling like a thermostat with no off switch.

interviewer: It sounds like these patterns—checking, recalibrating, and using humor or substances to manage anxiety—have created a cycle where your efforts to control stress end up fueling it further. What did I miss or get wrong in that summary?

patient: You’re close, but… the basil’s not just a project—it’s a *benchmark*. If it thrives, I think maybe I’m doing something right. If it wilts? It’s like the universe’s way of saying, ‘Even the low-maintenance stuff is failing.’ And the wine… it used to be a reset button. Now it’s just another system check. One glass, two glasses—either I’m tolerant or it’s *not* working. My hands know the difference. They cramp either way. But hey, at least the thermostat’s not melting in my dreams anymore. Progress?

interviewer: It sounds like the basil plant and wine use are both tied to your need for control and self-assessment in a chaotic system. What did I miss or get wrong in that understanding?

patient: You’re on the right track, but the basil’s more of a… litmus test. If it’s green, I’m passing. If it’s yellow? I’m a disaster waiting for a system reboot. And the wine—well, it’s not a control mechanism anymore. It’s just… damage control. My hands know the difference between a 5% and 15% tolerance level, though. They cramp like I’m typing through concrete. I guess I’m a walking maintenance ticket?

interviewer: It sounds like we’re starting to map out how these patterns—checking the basil as a barometer, using wine for damage control, and recalibrating everything from thermostats to your partner’s cough—are all part of a system you’ve built to manage anxiety, even if it’s starting to feel unsustainable. Does this model make sense to you, or would you adjust any part of it?

patient: I mean... yeah, the 'system' part makes sense. I guess I just didn't realize how many redundancies I've built in. Like, the basil plant isn't just a metaphor—it's a *litmus test* for everything. If it wilts, I start recalibrating my whole day. The wine? That's just... another thermostat. Turn it up a degree, see if the static goes down. But you're right about the 'unsustainable' part. My hands are too tired tonight to even water it properly. Again.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve identified key parts of the system—like the basil plant as a litmus test and wine as damage control—that both reflect your need for control and contribute to the cycle of exhaustion. What did I miss or get wrong in that understanding?

patient: You didn’t mention how I start... overanalyzing things that aren’t even my responsibility. Like when my partner coughs, I’ll spend the whole night Googling rare lung diseases instead of just making tea. And the wine? It’s not really ‘damage control’ anymore—it’s more like a placeholder. A way to say, ‘I’m managing’ when my hands are still shaking from checking the thermostat for the tenth time. But I guess that’s just... another redundancy.

interviewer: That’s an important distinction about overanalyzing non-responsibility and the wine’s evolving role. Before we move forward, is there anything else I haven’t captured that’s important for us to consider? If not, what would you like to prioritize first in addressing these patterns—exploring therapy, discussing potential lifestyle adjustments, or something else?

patient: I think you’ve got the blueprint right, but maybe missed the… foundation? Like, the basil’s not just a litmus test—it’s this quiet panic button I can’t unplug from. If it droops, I start Googling ‘overwatering’ at 2 a.m. even though I’m too drained to save it. And the wine? It’s less ‘damage control’ now and more… a placeholder. Like I’m filling a void with something that just… stretches the silence. But maybe therapy’s not about tearing down the whole system? Maybe it’s about… fine-tuning the circuit breakers before they short out. I’ll drink less. I’ll… try not to Google my partner’s cough into a mystery illness. For now.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re describing how the basil plant and wine have become both a measure and a temporary fix for your anxiety, even if they’re no longer effective. What would you like to prioritize first in addressing these patterns—exploring therapy, adjusting coping strategies, or something else?

patient: I think… I’ll focus on the small adjustments first. Like, if the basil’s a panic button I can’t unplug, maybe I just… water it less obsessively. And the wine? I’ll stick to one glass, no spillover into Tuesday. Therapy’s not a bad idea, but I need to feel like I’m not… short-circuiting the whole system at once. Let me see if I can stop Googling my partner’s cough for three days straight. If that holds, we’ll circle back.

interviewer: It sounds like your plan to start with small, manageable adjustments—like watering the basil less obsessively and limiting wine to one glass—is a way to test your system without overloading it. What did I miss or get wrong in that understanding, and is there anything else you’d like to add before we finalize this plan?

patient: You didn’t miss the foundation—though I guess you could say the basil’s still my ‘early warning system,’ even if I’m trying not to trip the alarm every time a leaf droops. And the wine? One glass is one glass, but I’m bracing for the day I realize I’m just replacing one circuit breaker with a fuse made of… well, more wine. But for now, I’ll stick to the maintenance log. If I can survive three days without Googling my partner’s cough into a Netflix docu-series, we’ll call it a systems update.

interviewer: Kristin, to recap, we’ve identified that your anxiety and checking rituals are significantly impacting your work and relationships, and your wine use is evolving as a coping strategy. For next steps, I recommend we connect you with a therapist who can help build more sustainable coping tools, and we can revisit your progress in a few weeks. Do you have any final questions or concerns before we wrap up today?

patient: I guess that makes sense. The maintenance plan feels… solid, like a good system update. I’ll mention the therapist to my partner—though they’ll probably joke about me needing a ‘mental HVAC check.’ And, uh, I’ll keep an eye on the basil plant. It’s already survived three of my forgetfulness episodes this week. Maybe I’ll finally watch that Netflix docu-series about stress… just to pretend I’m learning something new.
