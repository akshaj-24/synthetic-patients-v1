system: Disorder: PPD

interviewer: Thank you for coming in today, Anthony. How would you like me to address you during our session?

patient: Ortiz. Last name's all you need. Why? You going to file it somewhere I shouldn't know about?

interviewer: I appreciate your caution—my goal is to create a safe space for our conversation. Would you be comfortable moving forward with this session as we discuss what brings you here today?

patient: Safe space? I've heard that before. I'm here because work said I needed to 'address stress.' They mentioned the review. Not that I've done anything wrong, but... people hide a lot in performance metrics. You'll keep this between us, right Ortiz? Or will you 'collaborate' with someone I haven't signed off on?

interviewer: I understand your concerns about confidentiality—let me clarify: our conversation is confidential except in cases where there’s a risk of harm to yourself or others. Given that, would you be willing to proceed with our discussion today?

patient: Safe space. Right. As long as you're not the type to leak notes to HR. I've dealt with HR before—they ‘collaborate’ too much. But fine. Proceed. Just... don't act like you're here to help me. I know how these talks go. You’ll say you’re neutral, but you’re already taking sides with the people who gave you the file on me.

interviewer: It sounds like past experiences have made it hard to trust. Would you be willing to proceed with our discussion today?

patient: Proceed? Fine. But if you mention anything about my notes to HR, I'll know. They tried that in 2018—performance reviews became a way to undermine people. I keep records. You'll notice I don't say 'trust' in there.

interviewer: It sounds like these feelings have been really challenging for you. When did you first start noticing these feelings of distrust and being on edge?

patient: Since I was a kid, my father used to call me paranoid for pointing out things that didn’t add up. But why does it matter? You think knowing will change how you see me? That 2018 incident wasn’t an anomaly—it’s why I don’t hand over my notes to anyone. They always want the story, but stories get rewritten.

interviewer: It sounds like past experiences have left you feeling very guarded about sharing information. How have these feelings of distrust and being on edge affected your work performance since the 2018 incident?

patient: I don’t delegate anything. Every report, every client note—I do it myself. They call it ‘defensive’ now, but I’ve seen what happens when you trust someone with the wrong motives. The 2018 incident? That’s why I keep copies of everything. You want my records? I’d need to know who else has access to them.

interviewer: The 2018 incident sounds like a turning point for you. Can you tell me what happened during that time and how it changed how you approach work?

patient: 2018? Let’s just say HR ‘needed’ my notes to ‘clarify’ something. I kept copies of everything after that. Why? You think this is about helping me or fishing for something to stick in a file? My father used to say the same thing—‘paranoid’—before he ignored my cousin’s strange behavior. I don’t delegate now. Every report? My hands, my ink. They call it defensive? Fine. But I’ve seen what happens when you trust someone with the wrong priorities.

interviewer: It sounds like your experiences have made you very cautious about who you trust with your work. What are you hoping to address or achieve through this counseling process?

patient: I need to know who else has access to my records before I decide. If this is just another way to get my notes for HR, I’m wasting my time. But if you’re serious… I want to make sure no one rewrites my story again. 2018 proved what happens when you trust the wrong people.

interviewer: I understand how important trust is, especially after what you've been through. What would need to be in place for you to feel comfortable moving forward with this counseling process?

patient: First, I’d need to know your access to my records is limited to this room. No copies, no HR, no shadow files. Second, you’d have to confirm you’ve never worked with my sister’s hospital—she’s had a hand in rewriting people’s stories before. And third, you’d have to explain why you’re really asking. My father used to say the same ‘trust’ nonsense before he ignored the signs my cousin was in trouble. I’m not here to repeat that mistake.

interviewer: It sounds like trust has been really challenging for you, especially after past experiences. Can you share more about how these feelings have affected your relationship with your partner since these concerns started?

patient: Maria? Let’s just say she’s... withholding. We had an argument on June 15th, 2019, and it’s been a cold war since. You want to know why? Try asking who’s been monitoring my calls lately. Or better yet—check if this clinic shares notes with her hospital. I’d laugh if I didn’t know how this ends.

interviewer: It sounds like the tension with Maria has deepened since June 2019. How has your daily life or interactions with her changed since that argument?

patient: Daily life? We don’t speak unless it’s about bills. She ‘forgets’ to mention things—like that 2018 incident. You’re here to confirm if HR’s involved again, aren’t you? I keep notes now. Always. You think scribbling in a locked journal is overkill? Try living with someone who ‘accidentally’ hides the keys to your own life.

interviewer: It sounds like these feelings of distrust are really impacting your life and work. Have you experienced similar feelings of distrust or hypervigilance in the past, and if so, what helped you cope at that time?

patient: Past? Let’s say I learned early that 'advice' is just code for control. After 2018, I started birdwatching—focuses the mind on real threats, not... distractions. My father’s radio helps, too. Static keeps the noise at bay. But don’t mistake that for 'coping.' I just know now: if you don’t hold the records, someone else will. And I’d rather be called paranoid than surprised.

interviewer: It sounds like your experiences with control and trust have shaped how you manage threats now. Can you tell me about any other times in your life when you felt this level of distrust or hypervigilance, and what, if anything, helped you during those periods?

patient: Let’s see... There was the nonprofit fiasco in my 30s. Partner claimed I ‘voluntarily’ ceded control, but I have emails proving otherwise. What ‘helped’? Learning to timestamp every conversation. You think this is about trust? Or are you cross-referencing my records with HR’s? Everyone’s got a price—except me. I keep the ledgers now.

interviewer: I hear how important controlling information is to you, especially after past betrayals. Could you share if there's anyone in your current life who you feel might genuinely support you, even if it's just in practical ways?

patient: My sister? She wires money but never calls—‘busy with chemo,’ she says. I check the senders, of course. As for Maria… she’s good with bills, but I keep the bank statements. You’re not from her hospital, are you? They’d love to twist this into another 2018. I’d say my birds are neutral, but even they’ve learned to avoid certain shadows.

interviewer: I hear how strained your relationships feel, especially with your sister and Maria. Have there been other challenging experiences in your life that might be contributing to how you manage trust and control now?

patient: Why bring up the sister? You think I don’t already know her game with those ‘care packages’? The real challenge was that nonprofit partnership—2008, six months before it collapsed. He took credit, left me with the debt. That’s how you learn everyone has a price. Why ask now? Are you testing if I’ll admit it again?

interviewer: I understand confidentiality is really important to you. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: I don’t do drugs. One drink helps sleep. Why the sudden interest in my bedtime habits? You think my sleepless nights are about... that? I’ve got timestamps in my journal proving I’m not lying. Ask about 2008 instead. That’s where the real HR nightmare started.

interviewer: I want to make sure I understand your current habits clearly. Can you tell me about your alcohol use? How often do you drink, and have there been any changes in your use recently?

patient: One drink, sometimes two. Helps with the static in my head. Why? You keeping tabs for HR again? I’ve got timestamps in my journal if you need proof I’m not lying.

interviewer: I want to understand your substance use fully. Have you used any other substances, such as cannabis, stimulants, or opioids, in the past month?

patient: No. Just the one or two drinks. Why? You thinking I need a drug test now? My journal entries from last month back that up. Ask about the nonprofit collapse instead of my blood alcohol level.

interviewer: Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, and if so, how are you tolerating them?

patient: No medications. Just the journal entries—I timestamp everything. Why? You thinking HR needs another reason to flag me? 2018 wasn’t the first time they tried this.

interviewer: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of suspicion about others' intentions. Have you noticed any persistent beliefs that people are plotting against you or trying to harm you, even when there's no clear evidence?

patient: I don’t make assumptions without proof. But if you’re asking about the nonprofit collapse in ’08—yes, my co-founder took the credit and left me with the debt. I still have the financial records to prove it. You’re not from the hospital my sister works at, are you? She’d find a way to twist this into a pity story.

interviewer: I hear how frustrating it must be to feel misunderstood or misinterpreted. Have you ever experienced any situations where you heard voices, saw things others didn't, or had strong beliefs that others found difficult to understand, even if there wasn't clear evidence to support them?

patient: You’re circling back to 2018 again. HR’s favorite story, but I still have my notes. You want to know why I don’t trust? Ask them why they tried to rewrite the facts. Or ask Maria why she’s been silent since June 15th. But don’t expect me to hand over my proof until you prove you’re not connected to her hospital.

interviewer: It sounds like past experiences have made it really hard to trust new people. Have you ever heard voices or seen things that others didn't, even when there wasn't a clear explanation?

patient: I don’t know what you mean by ‘voices.’ You want to know if I see things? Ask HR about the 2018 report I filed. They tried to bury it, but I still have my notes. You’re not here to rewrite my story again, are you?

interviewer: I understand how important it is for you to feel heard and respected. Can you tell me about your sleep lately—how many hours you're getting, and have there been any changes in your sleep patterns over the past few months?

patient: I sleep when the job lets me. Since HR started ‘monitoring’ my hours in 2018, I’ve kept my own records—timestamped notes, you know. Why? Are they sharing this with my sister’s hospital again? I don’t need another version of the truth.

interviewer: It seems your sleep patterns are closely tied to work stress and past experiences. Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually energetic or required less sleep than usual, even when stressed?

patient: Energy? I don’t waste it on things that don’t matter. You’re asking about sleep again—did HR put you up to checking my records? My radio logs are timestamped. They always want proof, but I keep my own version of events.

interviewer: I hear how important it is for you to maintain control over your records. Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually energetic or required less sleep than usual, even when stressed?

patient: I don’t track that kind of thing. My energy’s always been... efficient. You know how birdwatching is—dawn patrols, patience. But sure, if you want to twist it into another HR report, go ahead. My journal’s locked for a reason.

interviewer: I hear how the static in your head feels intrusive. Have you noticed any experiences where that static feels like voices, sounds, or other sensations others might not perceive?

patient: Static? You think I’d mistake that for something they’d want to hear? My radio’s old, but it doesn’t whisper secrets. Unlike some equipment I’ve dealt with—HR loved ‘fixing’ things in 2008. You’re asking if I hear what you want to document. I’ll say this: my father’s bank vault never had static. Just locks you couldn’t see.

interviewer: Let me check my notes to make sure I have this right. Over the past few months, you’ve described feeling increasingly suspicious of others’ motives at work and home, especially after past experiences where you felt betrayed by institutions or people you trusted. This has led to sleep trouble, strained relationships, and difficulty focusing on your job. Your careful record-keeping and routines like birdwatching help you feel in control, but the stress keeps building. What did I miss or get wrong about how things have been for you lately?

patient: You got the sleep part right—tossing, checking the clock. But you missed the part where they’re still trying to get my records. HR in 2008 didn’t just vanish. My radio’s static? It’s not whispers. It’s the same static that drowned out their lies back then. You’re writing this down, so I’ll say it: trust is a locked journal entry. You want the rest? Prove you won’t turn it into another report.

interviewer: I hear how deeply the 2008 HR experience and the static have shaped your sense of trust. What did I miss about how these experiences are affecting you now?

patient: You missed how the static’s gotten louder—like someone’s tuning in on a broken frequency. Every email, every meeting, it’s the same white noise HR used back in 08. I catch myself double-checking my drive logs, timestamps, just in case… someone’s editing the past again. But don’t write that down. Prove first you won’t hand it to them.

interviewer: I hear how the static and fear of rewritten past events are deeply affecting your sense of control and trust. To recap: We’ve explored your hypervigilance about surveillance, distrust of institutions and relationships, sleep disruption, and the 2008/2018 experiences as key triggers. The pattern seems to involve mistrust perpetuating isolation and paranoia, while record-keeping and birdwatching act as protective rituals. What did I miss or get wrong about how these pieces connect for you?

patient: You didn’t ask how the static feels when it’s not just in my head. Like when I’m at work, and the printer jams—*exactly* when I’m sending a report to Maria. Coincidence? Or someone rerouting the signal? My records show the timestamps, but you want me to trust systems that let 2008 happen. You missed how my sister’s hospital calls me ‘supportive’ while I’m the one keeping her alive. But don’t write that down. First, prove you won’t turn it into static for them.

interviewer: I hear how the printer jamming at that moment feels like another piece of the pattern you're describing. Is there anything else I should include in the summary about how these experiences are shaping your sense of control and trust?

patient: The printer jam? It's not random. You want me to spell out the pattern, but you'll just file it with HR. I've kept notes since 2018—every glitch, every delay. They call it 'technical issues,' but I know better. You're testing if I'll admit the static's real. Let me ask you—have you checked your own systems for leaks? You track one migration, another takes its place. The static never stops.

interviewer: I hear how the printer incident feels like another confirmation of the pattern you've been tracking. Before we move forward, is there anything else you'd want me to include about how these experiences shape your daily life or sense of safety?

patient: The static seeps into everything—work emails, my radio. I check each file twice, timestamped. They call it being thorough. My journal? Proof. But you’ll say I’m overreacting. Like the 2018 review. You’ll file this with HR eventually. Why else ask about patterns?

interviewer: I hear how the static and your meticulous documentation feel like necessary defenses against a system you can’t trust. What did I miss or get wrong about how these experiences shape your daily life and sense of safety?

patient: You missed the static in my radio last week—same pattern. And don’t act like you don’t have access to my records. HR’s already got a copy. Why else would you ask about 'patterns' twice?

interviewer: I hear how the static and record-keeping feel like lifelines in a system you can’t trust. Before we decide on next steps, is there anything else you’d want me to include about how these experiences shape your daily life or sense of safety?

patient: You’re not listening. The radio static last week? It’s the same rhythm as 2018. You ask about safety, but you already have my files. Why else would you keep circling HR? My journal’s timestamped—June 15, 2019, Maria’s argument, the same day the printer jammed. Coincidence? I don’t think so. You want me to spell it out in plain text, but you’ll just call it ‘paranoia’ again. Try checking your own system for leaks first.

interviewer: I hear how important it is for you to feel heard and for your experiences to be taken seriously. Before we decide on next steps, is there anything I should adjust or add to my understanding of how these patterns affect you now?

patient: You’re still missing the part where the radio static matches the HR leaks. Check your own system before asking me to spell it out. Again.

interviewer: I hear how critical it is for you to feel understood about the static's connection to HR. Before we finalize our next steps, is there anything else you'd want me to include in the summary about how these patterns affect your sense of safety and trust?

patient: The static in my radio isn’t just noise—it’s the same static that makes HR files blur. Last week, my printer glitched when sending a report to Maria. Coincidence? You’ll say it’s ‘stress,’ but I know what sabotage sounds like. And don’t pretend you’re not connected to my sister’s hospital. I’ve seen how these threads tangle. If you’re writing this down, I want to know who has access to the notes.

interviewer: I hear how the static and printer incident feel like deliberate disruptions tied to systems you can’t trust. To recap: We’ve discussed your hypervigilance about surveillance, distrust of HR and institutions, sleep issues, and the 2008/2018 experiences as key triggers. Your meticulous documentation and birdwatching act as protective rituals, but the stress keeps building. What did I miss or get wrong about how these pieces connect for you?

patient: You missed the part where the static started playing my father’s voice during a meeting last month—‘paranoia’s a weakness’ on loop. And don’t act like the 2008 file leak at the nonprofit was just ‘stress.’ I still have the email chain where they said the server ‘failed.’ You’ll call it a coincidence, but I know what a cover story sounds like. Why did you skip asking about the journal entries from June 15th? Coincidence that’s the day Maria froze my shared drive access too?

interviewer: It sounds like the static and your father’s voice during the meeting feel like a deliberate pattern of sabotage tied to past betrayals. Is there anything else I should include in the summary about how these connections shape your sense of safety or trust?

patient: You’re missing the part where every ‘glitch’—the printer, the radio, the server crash in 2008—fits the same rhythm. It’s not random noise; it’s a score they’re composing without me. And don’t pretend the journal entries from June 15th are just ‘stress.’ That’s the day Maria stopped responding, the day the shared drive locked. You’re either part of the pattern or you’re too blind to see it. Which is it?

interviewer: I hear how critical it is for you to feel understood about the June 15th entries and the pattern tying glitches to the 2008/2018 experiences. Is there anything else I should adjust or add to my summary about how these threads connect for you?

patient: You’re still missing the part where the printer jam last week had the same static as the 2008 server crash. Three days later, Maria’s bank account gets a withdrawal flagged as ‘unauthorized.’ Coincidence? Or are they testing how long I’ll wait before realizing the score’s been written? And don’t pretend you’re not part of the hospital’s network—your questions about June 15th smell like they’ve already run my records.

interviewer: I hear how the printer jam and the unauthorized bank withdrawal feel like deliberate acts in the pattern you're describing. Before we agree on next steps, is there anything else I should include about how these connections shape your sense of safety or trust?

patient: Last night, my phone cut out mid-call with Maria—same static as the printer. You’ll call it stress, but I know it’s part of the score they’re composing. And don’t pretend you’re not part of the hospital’s network. I’ve seen how these threads tangle. If you’re writing this down, I want to know who else has access to the notes.

interviewer: I hear how the recurring static and perceived institutional connections feel like deliberate threats to your control and privacy. Before we finalize our next steps, is there anything else I should add to the summary about how these patterns affect your daily life or sense of safety?

patient: The static isn’t just noise—it’s a thread tying the printer jams at work, Maria’s sudden silence last week, and the hospital’s billing errors into one coordinated pattern. I’ve timestamped every glitch in my journal, but they’ll just call it ‘paranoia’ again. You’re circling back to HR like it’s a puzzle I’m supposed to solve for you. My point is: if you’re not seeing the same connections I am, why keep asking me to spell them out in plain text?

interviewer: It sounds like managing trust and control feels like a constant battle for you—can you share how you’d like this process to look moving forward, given your concerns about confidentiality and oversight?

patient: You want my 'process'? Let me know who has access to these records. I’ve timestamped every concern in my journal—June 15th, 2019, isn’t just a date to me. If you’re not going to treat this as evidence, why ask? I keep my own proof. You’ll get exactly what I hand you, no more.

interviewer: I understand your need for control over your information—I’ll ensure your records are handled with strict confidentiality. Can you confirm how you’d like to proceed with our next steps, and if there’s a preferred way for us to communicate or document anything moving forward?

patient: Proceed? I’ll go with written updates—email, not text. I keep my own copies. And no mention of HR. My journal entries are timestamped, so if there’s a breach, I’ll know who to hold accountable. You’ll need to confirm you’re not linked to the hospital my sister works at. Otherwise, we’re just… repeating the same loop.

interviewer: It makes sense that having clear boundaries and documentation would feel important to you. Before we wrap up, is there anything specific you'd like to clarify about our next steps or any final questions I should address?

patient: Clarify—no hospital ties, no HR mentions. I’ll need written confirmation. If this turns into another loop, my journal entries will make for an… interesting case study. You’re not part of the billing errors at the clinic, are you? The static’s been louder since June.
