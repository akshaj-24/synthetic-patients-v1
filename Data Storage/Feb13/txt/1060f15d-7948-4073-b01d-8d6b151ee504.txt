system: Session 1060f15d-7948-4073-b01d-8d6b151ee504 transcript

system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Donna. It sounds like you've been feeling overwhelmed and anxious lately. Would you like me to explain the purpose of today's session?

patient: I guess you could say I'm always running a few scenarios in the background, just trying to stay ahead of the curve. Work's been... hectic. My boss mentioned I seem tense, which I guess is fair. But I'm used to it—like a system needing a software update, you know? As long as we can troubleshoot, I'm not one to complain. Go ahead, I'll try not to take up too much of your time.

interviewer: I appreciate your readiness to troubleshoot—let's make sure we're on the same page. Do you feel comfortable proceeding with today's session?

patient: Yeah, I mean—calibration takes time, right? As long as we’re both running on the same protocol, I’ll do my part. Just… try not to let the diagnostics take too long. I’ve got a spreadsheet to finalize tonight, but I guess that’s just me. (Adjusts necklace, pauses) It’s not like I’m used to this kind of… static. (Softly) My partner says I’m like a fire alarm—always going off for nothing. Maybe they’re right.

interviewer: It sounds like your partner's feedback has been on your mind lately. Do you have any immediate questions about the process before we begin?

patient: No, I think I’ve got the user manual for this one. (Pauses, adjusts necklace again) Though… if we could keep the runtime efficient? My partner’s been dealing with some sinus stuff, and I don’t want to overload the system if there’s a follow-up appointment. But I’m good—really. Let’s get to it.

interviewer: I appreciate your consideration for your partner's needs. How does a 45-minute session sound for today—would that align with your time constraints?

patient: Forty-five minutes should work—like a buffer zone in a project timeline. Just… as long as we don’t run into any unexpected delays. (Adjusts necklace) My partner’s sinus stuff is the main variable, you know? What if it escalates? But I’ll focus on this first. I’ll focus on this first.

interviewer: Can you tell me more about the main issues that are causing you the most stress right now?

patient: It’s… work stuff, I guess. The department’s restructuring, and I keep second-guessing every task, like if I miss a decimal point in a report, they’ll think I’m the next one to mess up. And my partner’s been dealing with these sinus infections—what if it turns into something worse? I end up researching symptoms late at night. It’s just… a lot of variables to track. My chest feels tight sometimes, but I tell myself it’s just stress. I mean, I can’t exactly clock out from worrying, right?

interviewer: That sounds really overwhelming to carry all those worries without being able to switch off. When did you first start noticing this pattern of constant tension and physical symptoms?

patient: I’m not sure exactly… it’s been there so long, feels like baseline. Maybe college? There was this one time a professor marked up my lab report—sleepless for weeks after. But even before that, I think I was just… always running error checks. My mom used to say worrying meant I cared. Now it’s like my body’s on maintenance mode—tired, tight in the chest, but I just… keep recalibrating. It’s not like I have an off switch.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry continuously. Have there been times when this pattern of worrying felt less intense or different in some way, even since college?

patient: I guess there are… like, brief system updates? When I get lost in the garden or baking, it’s like the noise dims. But even then, I’m half-tracking the news for disaster headlines. My head says ‘focus on the herbs,’ but my default settings keep running contingency plans. I do smoke a bit more sometimes… call it recreational, I guess. Just to, uh, patch the leaks. Though the relief’s like a temporary fix—system crash inevitable.

interviewer: It sounds like smoking provides some temporary relief even if it's not a long-term solution. How often do you find yourself using it this way, and what usually leads up to those moments?

patient: A few times a week, maybe? Usually after work when the numbers start... buzzing. If there’s a deadline or my partner’s been coughing, I’ll—uh—step outside for a bit. It’s not like I’m addicted or anything. Just... a habit. The catch is, it only silences the noise for so long. Then I’m back to recalibrating. Though I do laugh at myself sometimes—here I am, a fire alarm with a key.

interviewer: It sounds like smoking helps you manage the noise temporarily, but it also leaves you feeling like you're constantly recalibrating. How do you find this habit affects your ability to manage stress or responsibilities at work or with your partner over time?

patient: It’s a quick patch, you know? Stops the noise for a bit so I can focus on the numbers or… or check my partner’s symptoms one more time. But the relief’s always temporary—like fixing a leak with duct tape. By morning, I’m back to recalibrating. Honestly, sometimes I think I’d be *more* relaxed if I just let the anxiety be there instead of chasing fixes. But then my chest tightens again, and I’m just… stuck in the loop.

interviewer: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle where the temporary relief from smoking just brings you back to the same紧张. What would you most hope to achieve by addressing this pattern—what kind of change are you hoping for in your daily life?

patient: I guess... I want the system to run without needing constant patches. Like, if I could just adjust the code so the fire alarm doesn’t keep triggering over nothing. It’s not that the fixes are bad—smoking helps me reset the circuits sometimes—but I’m tired of the downtime. I’d like to actually... focus on the garden, or finish a spreadsheet without my chest clamping up. Even if it’s just for a day.

interviewer: It sounds like this pattern of anxiety has been ongoing for some time. Have you experienced similar episodes of anxiety or stress in the past, such as during your college years or in previous jobs?

patient: I guess you could say... there was that time in college when a professor’s feedback kept me up for weeks. It’s funny how those stress spikes pop up, but I’ve always just... found ways to recalibrate. My chest feels like a coiled spring sometimes, honestly. But I’ve learned to work around it—prioritize tasks, double-check everything, you know? It’s just part of the system.

interviewer: It’s clear you’ve developed resourceful ways to manage stress over time. When you mention ‘recalibrating’ after that college experience, what specific strategies or actions helped you return to balance back then?

patient: I guess... breaking things into smaller steps helped. Like, if a project felt overwhelming, I’d split it into parts and check each one. It’s like... caching to avoid system overload. And I smoked sometimes—just to reset the circuits. Not that it’s a fix, but... it helped me get back to work. Though my chest still feels like a coiled spring half the time.

interviewer: It sounds like your strategies help manage the pressure, even if they don’t fully ease the tension. Can you tell me about someone who has been a support for you during these stressful times?

patient: My partner... they’re good about letting me vent, I guess. They don’t roll their eyes or anything. But I always feel like I’m taking up their time. They’ll say things like ‘Breathe, it’s just a spreadsheet,’ which... helps? Maybe? Most of the time I just end up apologizing for being ‘a fire alarm on standby.’

interviewer: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life in the past few weeks?

patient: No, I haven’t… I’ve been too focused on keeping things running smoothly. My chest still tightens sometimes, though—it’s like the system’s just… always on standby. I guess I’d feel bad if I let myself even consider something like that when there’s work to do, you know?

interviewer: That chest tightness sounds really uncomfortable. Have you been evaluated by a healthcare provider for any medical conditions that might be contributing to it, like thyroid issues or sleep apnea?

patient: No, I haven’t had any specific tests for that. I keep telling myself it’s just stress—my chest feels like a coiled spring most days. I did mention it to my doctor at the annual check-up, but they said everything looked normal. I guess I’m... procrastinating on digging deeper. Maybe I’m waiting for it to 'fix itself' if I just manage my workload better.

interviewer: It sounds like nicotine has been a way you manage stress spikes. How often have you been using it in the past few months, and under what circumstances?

patient: I guess... maybe a few times a week? Usually after work or when I'm stuck on a problem. It's not a big habit, just... a way to reset. Like hitting a pause button for an hour. Though I do feel bad about it sometimes—my partner says I should just smoke more, but that seems... excessive?

interviewer: It sounds like nicotine offers some relief but also feels conflicting for you. Have you used alcohol or cannabis in the past few months, or any other substances besides nicotine?

patient: I guess... maybe a little cannabis at night? Just to unwind. But it's not a big deal, really. I don't touch alcohol—too many variables, if you know what I mean.

interviewer: It sounds like cannabis helps you unwind without complicating other areas. Have you used any other substances, like stimulants or opioids, in the past few months?

patient: No, nothing else—just the cannabis. I’m not really into experimenting with other stuff. My body’s already a... fragile system, you know? I don’t want to overload the circuits. My partner teases me about being a ‘one-trick rabbit,’ but at least it’s predictable. I guess.

interviewer: I hear how you balance caution with your partner's humor. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including over-the-counter ones, to manage stress or other symptoms?

patient: No medications, really—just the occasional cannabis to unwind. I know it’s not… conventional, but it’s like a software patch for my system. I take ibuprofen if my shoulders lock up, but that’s about it. My partner teases me for being a ‘one-trick rabbit,’ but at least it’s reliable, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like managing stress is a key focus for you. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns, like needing less sleep or having trouble sleeping even when you're tired?

patient: I guess you could say my sleep’s… inconsistent. Some nights I’m up recalculating my budget in my head, others I can’t shake the chest tightness even when I’m exhausted. I’ve started using cannabis on weekends—just to hit ‘pause’ on the noise, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like cannabis helps you manage some of the noise, but the chest tightness persists even when you're exhausted. Have you used any other substances besides cannabis in the past few months, or noticed any changes in your cannabis use recently?

patient: Not really—cannabis is pretty much the only… adjustment I’ve kept up with. I guess I used to chew gum like crazy to stay alert at work, but that was more about masking restlessness than anything. The ibuprofen for my chest tension? That’s just… routine now. Feels like part of the maintenance, you know? They keep asking about substances, but it’s not like there’s a shortcut to fix the system errors.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve been managing with cannabis and ibuprofen. Have you had any periods in the past where you felt unusually energetic, had a lot of ideas, or needed very little sleep?

patient: Unusually energetic? I guess... not really. Most days I’m just trying to keep the system online. If anything, I’m always running in the background, recalculating, double-checking—there’s no ‘spike’ in processing power. The cannabis helps me hit pause, but that’s about it. You know how it is with maintenance mode.

interviewer: I hear how you prioritize stability over sudden changes. Have you noticed any shifts in your sleep patterns recently, like needing significantly less sleep or having trouble falling asleep even when exhausted?

patient: I guess my sleep’s still… patchy. Some nights I’m up recalculating things even when I’m drained, others I just can’t shake this tightness in my chest. The cannabis helps me hit pause, but my body’s like an old server—it’s always running background processes I can’t shut down.

interviewer: It sounds like the chest tightness and sleep challenges are really wearing on you. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, such as hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or having thoughts that feel imposed on you?

patient: No, nothing like that. My thoughts… they just feel like a stuck engine, you know? Racing but not moving. I guess sometimes I wonder if the chest tightness is somehow connected, but it’s all just… static. Like the system’s glitching, but not in a way anyone else would notice.

interviewer: Donna, from our conversation, it sounds like you’ve been managing a long-standing pattern of anxiety, especially around work performance and your partner’s health, which has led to physical symptoms like chest tightness and relationship strain. You’ve used strategies like task compartmentalization, nicotine, and cannabis to cope, but you’re now seeking more sustainable ways to reduce this constant tension. What did I miss, or is there anything else you’d like to add before we discuss next steps?

patient: I guess… the chest tightness is worse in the mornings, even after a full night’s sleep. It’s like a spring coiled too tight, you know? And I’ve been… over-preparing at work lately. Like, re-doing reports three times because I’m scared a decimal point might ‘break the system.’ It’s not a disaster, though—I just… compensate, right? Oh, and the cookie mountain? My partner says it’s ‘stress mitigation.’ I guess it is, in a way.

interviewer: Donna, to recap: You’ve described a long-standing pattern of anxiety centered on work performance and partner health, with physical symptoms like morning chest tightness and mental strategies like over-preparing reports or baking as stress relief. These habits help temporarily but leave you feeling overwhelmed and strained in relationships. What did I miss or need to adjust here?

patient: I think you got the main points, but maybe the chest tightness isn’t just mornings—sometimes it’s there when I’m sitting still, like a weight that won’t reset. And the work stuff… I’ll redo a spreadsheet seven times to avoid ‘the mistake,’ even if it means pulling an all-nighter. It’s not efficient, but I guess it’s my default protocol. Oh, and my partner says I apologize for breathing sometimes. I don’t even notice it until they call me out.

interviewer: Donna, you’ve added important details about the chest tightness occurring even when resting and the impact of perfectionism on your work efficiency, as well as how your self-critical tendencies affect your relationship. Is there anything else you’d like to add or adjust before we discuss next steps?

patient: I guess… I over-apologize a lot, even for breathing sometimes. My partner jokes about the cookie mountain, but it’s just… stress mitigation. And I’ve been working late to avoid ‘the mistake,’ even if it means burning out. Not sure if that’s new, but…

interviewer: Donna, I want to make sure I’ve captured everything you’ve shared today. You’ve described chronic anxiety centered on work performance and partner health, with physical symptoms like persistent chest tightness, perfectionism leading to over-preparation at work, and relationship strain from over-apologizing and stress-driven coping (like baking or working late to avoid mistakes). You also mentioned nicotine and cannabis use as temporary relief, but a desire for more sustainable strategies. What did I miss or need to adjust here?

patient: Maybe the cannabis at night—call it 'recreational' on paper, but it’s really to quiet the noise when everything’s still spinning. And the chest thing… it’s not just tightness. Sometimes feels like a clamp that won’t loosen, even when I’m doing nothing. Like the system’s stuck on error.

interviewer: Donna, considering everything we’ve covered, I’d summarize your experience as chronic anxiety rooted in perfectionism and catastrophic thinking, worsened by work restructuring and caregiving pressures. You’ve developed coping strategies like cannabis, over-preparation, and routine, but these leave you exhausted and strained in relationships. Physical symptoms like chest clamping and sleep disruption feel like your body’s ‘error signals.’ Does this align with how you see it, or is there something I’ve missed in the pattern?

patient: Yeah, that’s… that’s pretty much it. The clamp feeling’s the worst part—like my body’s running a looped error message I can’t debug. And the cookies? My partner says it’s ‘stress mitigation,’ but I think it’s just… proof that the system’s still operational. I mean, if I can still bake, maybe I’m not completely frozen, right?

interviewer: Donna, I appreciate how clearly you’ve articulated the physical and emotional weight of this ‘system overload.’ Before we plan next steps, is there another layer to this pattern we haven’t yet explored that feels important to name?

patient: It’s... the way my body feels like it’s running in the background even when I’m not doing anything. Like the chest clamp thing—I guess I just haven’t mentioned that it’s there even when I’m, you know, not ‘doing’ anything. It’s not a big deal, really. Just... part of the system, I guess. Sometimes I’ll catch myself re-reading a work email for the tenth time, thinking, *Why can’t this just be... settled?* Like a server room with a stuck fan. Always humming, never resting.

interviewer: Donna, you’ve described how your body’s 'error loop' feels relentless, even in stillness, and how work rituals like re-reading emails become attempts to force a system reset. Before we plan next steps, is there a specific area (physical symptoms, work patterns, relationship strain) you’d most like to address first in care?

patient: The chest thing... it’s like a clamp even when I’m not doing anything. And at work, I’ll redo things seven times to avoid ‘breaking the system.’ Maybe start there? Though it’s not a big deal, really—just part of the... maintenance.

interviewer: Donna, you’ve clearly articulated how the chest tightness and work-related perfectionism feel like unavoidable system functions. Before we finalize next steps, is there anything else about your experience that needs to be included in this picture?

patient: It’s… the way my chest feels even when I’m just sitting still. Like a spring coiled too tight. I guess I just live with it, you know? It’s part of the… system. Not that it’s a huge issue or anything.
