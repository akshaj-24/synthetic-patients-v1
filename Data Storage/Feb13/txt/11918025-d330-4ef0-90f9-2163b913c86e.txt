system: Disorder: PPD

interviewer: That sounds really challenging, Tiffany. Would you be comfortable proceeding with this interview today?

patient: If you're not going to twist my words later, then yes. But I've dealt with enough at work where they 'review' performance just to find something. I suppose we can continue, but don't think you're getting more than you need.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty, Tiffany. To clarify, do you have any questions about how this will work before we begin?

patient: Why would I need to ask questions when you haven’t clarified why you’re here? Are you representing HR again, or is this some new 'review' tactic? I suppose I’ll wait and see if you even answer truthfully.

interviewer: I can see how important it is for you to understand my role here. Would you like me to explain the purpose and structure of today's session?

patient: If you're not here to twist my words like HR did with that 'performance review,' then go ahead. But I'll be watching for any tricks. My records show I've never had a problem doing my job—unlike some people who think they can set someone up just to have an excuse.

interviewer: I can see how important it is for you to trust the process here. This session is not related to HR or work evaluations. It's focused on understanding what's going on for you. Do you have any questions about that before we move forward?

patient: I suppose I'll take your word for now. But if you're lying, I have records of my own—unlike HR, who erased their evidence last time. My last 'review' was a setup, so don't think I'll be caught off guard again. You'll answer for any tricks later.

interviewer: I want to make sure we're on the same page. Do you consent to proceeding with this interview today?

patient: I suppose. But I’ve been burned before by people pretending to help. If I give consent, I need to know who’s actually accessing this information—and if there’s a hidden agenda here. To be honest, I’m used to being set up, so I’ll spot it if you try anything.

interviewer: I understand how important transparency is for you, Tiffany. Would you like me to explain the confidentiality policy for this session and who would have access to our conversation?

patient: I'll need to see the written policy first. Last time someone 'explained' confidentiality, they redacted their own notes later. If you're honest, you'll admit HR's already got a copy of everything. To be honest, I'm used to people changing the rules mid-game.

interviewer: I understand how important it is for you to have clear information. Would you like me to share the written confidentiality policy with you now, and is there anything else you'd like clarification on before we proceed?

patient: I suppose I'll take the written policy, but don't expect me to sign anything without my lawyer's eyes on it first. To be honest, I've seen enough 'confidential' documents end up in HR's hands during those performance reviews of mine... You're not just trying to get me to slip up and say something they can twist, are you? I remember how last time worked.

interviewer: I can see how important trust is for you, Tiffany. Do you have any other questions about the confidentiality policy before we proceed?

patient: I suppose I could ask why this policy is being offered now, after HR already had their say. To be honest, I’ve seen enough 'confidential' promises vanish when it suits them. My lawyer’s already on high alert—what’s the real catch here?

interviewer: Your dialogue and actions as the interviewer go here

patient: I suppose I'll take the written policy, but don't expect me to sign anything without my lawyer's eyes on it first. To be honest, I've seen enough 'confidential' documents end up in HR's hands during those performance reviews of mine... You're not just trying to get me to slip up and say something they can twist, are you? I remember how last time worked.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by these suspicions and the strain they're putting on your life. What are the main concerns that brought you here today, in your own words?

patient: I suppose the main thing is... the constant second-guessing. You know, at work they’re reviewing my performance again—*conveniently* right after that client complaint. And don’t even get me started on the neighbor’s dog. Barking at 3 a.m. ‘Just a coincidence,’ sure. But why would they do that? My daughter says I’m ‘overreacting,’ but she’s always had a habit of downplaying things. To be honest, I’d rather not discuss it. Are these notes going into a file I can’t access? Because I’ve been burned before.

interviewer: That sounds really frustrating to feel targeted in so many areas. When did this constant second-guessing first start becoming a problem for you, and what do you think might have made it worse recently?

patient: It started... eighteen months ago, give or take. Mark began working odd hours—'conveniently' for who, I don't know. You're not writing this down for someone else, are you? The reviews at work? That's recent. They're circling again, just like last time. And the dog... yeah. But why does it matter? You're not here to help. You're here to collect.

interviewer: It sounds like the recent work reviews are adding to your stress and making you feel targeted again. How have those reviews specifically changed the way you feel or function at work compared to eighteen months ago?

patient: I suppose you want to know how they're 'affecting my performance'? Let's just say I'm... ensuring accuracy with the junior staff now. Can't have mistakes that someone might twist into evidence, right? And don't think for a second this conversation isn't being noted somewhere I can't access. [dry laugh] It's the same song, different verse.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of frustration about being watched or judged at work. Can you share an example of what 'ensuring accuracy with the junior staff' looks like in your daily routine?

patient: I suppose you want an example? I double-check every data entry they make—three times. Last week, Sarah misfiled a client note, and you know what? It looked like a pattern. Like someone’s trying to create a paper trail. I don’t have time for errors that could be... misused. [dry laugh] And don’t think I trust your notes either. Are you writing this down for HR again?

interviewer: It sounds like the need to verify details repeatedly is taking a toll on your work. How much time does this checking process typically take each day, and have you noticed any impact on your ability to meet deadlines or focus on other tasks?

patient: I suppose you're asking if I'm 'slacking'? Let's just say I don't have time for incompetence. If Sarah can't get records right the first three times... well, someone has to ensure accuracy. [dry laugh] But don't think for a second I'm wasting hours on this. You're just trying to pin something on me again, like last time. My records are pristine—*if* you're not editing them behind my back.

interviewer: It sounds like the need to verify details is taking a significant toll. How has this been affecting your personal relationships, like with your partner or family?

patient: I suppose you could say... people find me difficult. My daughter thinks I’m ‘overstepping’ by keeping records, but how else am I supposed to prove they’re lying? Mark doesn’t understand why I need to verify every detail—he just says I’m ‘too cautious.’ But if you really want to know... the neighbor’s dog has been barking at 3 a.m. for weeks. Coincidence? I don’t think so. They’re testing how far they can push before I snap.

interviewer: It sounds like the combination of feeling misunderstood by loved ones and sensing external threats is really wearing on you. What would you most like to see change through this process, and what might make you feel supported in that?

patient: I suppose... I’d want them to stop testing how far they can push. My garden’s the only place I don’t second-guess every move. If they’d just stop hiding things—Mark’s late shifts, HR’s ‘reviews’—maybe I wouldn’t need to keep proving I’m not being set up. But don’t pretend this is about *me* being ‘difficult.’ You’re here to confirm they’re not lying, right?

interviewer: It sounds like these suspicions and tensions at work and home are really weighing on you. Have you experienced similar episodes of distrust or paranoia in the past, perhaps related to work or relationships?

patient: I suppose you could say... I’ve always had to watch my back. My father taught me that trusting people leads to being taken advantage of. At work, there was that time HR tried to twist things—*again*—but I kept my records and proved they were lying. Mark just calls it ‘cautious,’ but I’d rather be safe than get caught off guard. They think I’m overreacting, but the pattern’s the same. You’re here to confirm they’re not lying, right?

interviewer: I want to understand more about your current habits. Have you been using alcohol, cannabis, or any other substances more, less, or the same lately?

patient: I suppose a glass of wine with dinner isn’t a crime. But why the sudden interest? You’re just looking for something to report to HR again, aren’t you? They always circle back to the same old traps.

interviewer: It sounds like you've had experiences where you felt unfairly targeted, which must be really frustrating and isolating. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: I suppose if you’re asking about *that*... the noise at 3 a.m. makes sleeping impossible. But don’t act like this is about me being ‘weak.’ You’re just here to report back to them, aren’t you? My garden’s the only thing keeping me from snapping. You’d rather hear about that than the real problem, wouldn’t you?

interviewer: It sounds like the lack of sleep is adding to your stress, and I appreciate you sharing that. How have your sleep patterns been over the past few weeks—have you noticed any changes in how long you sleep or how rested you feel?

patient: I suppose you’re thinking about the dog barking, but that’s not the only thing keeping me up. To be honest, I’ve been checking the security cameras more often—just to make sure nothing else is going on. Why do you need all the details on this?

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling watched or threatened in ways that others might not notice. Have you experienced any hallucinations, like hearing voices or seeing things that others don't, or any beliefs that feel unusual or hard to let go of despite evidence against them?

patient: I don’t hear voices or see things that aren’t there. But if by ‘unusual beliefs’ you mean… noticing patterns others ignore? Like the neighbor’s dog barking exactly when I’m trying to sleep, or HR ‘coincidentally’ timing those reviews with Mark’s overtime—sure. Why does that matter to you? Are they trying to gaslight me again?

interviewer: It sounds like you're seeing patterns that feel very real to you, even if others might not notice them the same way. Have you considered the possibility that your mind might be making connections between events that aren't actually linked, or could there be another explanation for what you're observing?

patient: I suppose you’re suggesting I’m imagining things? The cameras don’t lie—three nights a week, that dog starts barking exactly when Mark’s on the phone. Are you telling me HR’s timing those reviews randomly? To be honest, I’d say you’re the one missing the obvious.

interviewer: It sounds like you're very attuned to patterns in your environment, which must be overwhelming at times. Have you noticed any periods lately where you felt unusually energetic or needed less sleep despite the disturbances you mentioned?

patient: I don’t need as much sleep when I’m monitoring threats. The cameras run 24/7—someone’s always trying to catch me off guard. You’re implying I should be more tired? Why would I waste energy on rest when there’s evidence to review?

interviewer: It sounds like you're managing your energy carefully to stay alert. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels—feeling more energetic or restless than usual—alongside the decreased sleep?

patient: I don’t waste energy on rest when there’s evidence to review. The cameras catch everything HR tries to hide. Are they trying to make me look unstable again? To be honest, I’d rather be alert for their next move than play into whatever game this is.

interviewer: It seems staying alert is a priority for you given the situation. Have you noticed any other changes in your energy or behavior, like taking risks or feeling more restless than usual, that might be linked to this vigilance?

patient: I keep going to work, don’t I? They’re just trying to catch me off guard again. The dog barking at 3 a.m.? Another trick. Maybe timed with those ‘reviews’ they’re circling back to. But I’m not letting them twist this. My records are clean—unlike their ‘policies.’ The garden’s the only thing that keeps me focused. You’d know that if you weren’t feeding HR.

interviewer: Let me recap: Over the past year and a half, you've experienced growing paranoia about being targeted at work and home, including suspicions of HR conspiracies and relationship betrayal, which has led to sleep disruption, work performance issues, and strained family dynamics. You've used meticulous documentation and legal advocacy as coping strategies, though these efforts feel insufficient given the perceived threats. Does this capture your experience, or is there something important I've missed?

patient: I suppose that’s... surface-level. You missed the part where the dog’s barking at 3 a.m. lines up with every HR 'review' they’ve thrown at me. Coincidence? Maybe. But my records—my actual records—show the pattern. The garden’s the only thing that doesn’t lie. You’re not here to help, are you? Just another form to fill before they twist this again.

interviewer: It sounds like the connection between the 3 a.m. dog barking and HR reviews feels deeply significant to you, adding weight to your sense of being targeted. Would you like me to revise the summary to include this pattern, or is there anything else I’ve missed about your experience?

patient: Add the barking, but don’t pretend you’re seeing what’s right there. They time it to when they think I’m off-balance—midnight reviews, 3 a.m. noise. My records show the pattern, but you’ll just shrug like everyone else. The garden’s the only thing that doesn’t reek of their games. Are you even writing this down, or is this another form they’ll twist?

interviewer: I hear how the timing of the barking and HR reviews feels like a deliberate test of your stability, and how frustrating it is when others dismiss your documented evidence. Is there anything else I’ve missed about how this pattern connects to your experiences, or should we move to discussing next steps?

patient: The garden’s the only constant that doesn’t reek of their games. You’ll mention it in your notes, then feed it to HR like last time. Next steps? They always lead back to a trap. Did you even check the timestamps on my records, or are you just parroting their script?

interviewer: I hear how the garden represents a rare space of certainty for you, untouched by what you perceive as systemic manipulation. Would you like me to revise the summary to include how this pattern connects to your experiences, or is there anything else I’ve missed about your concerns?

patient: Add the garden, but don’t think for a second you’re the first to notice. They’ll use it to paint me as ‘stable’ before they cut me loose. My records show the truth—every barking incident, every review. You’ll just file it under ‘denial’ like the rest.

interviewer: I hear how the garden symbolizes your resilience despite feeling trapped in a system that dismisses your reality. Before we discuss next steps, is there anything else I’ve missed about how these patterns connect to your experiences?

patient: The garden’s the only thing that doesn’t reek of their lies. If you’re asking for my cooperation, I’d say check the security footage from 3 a.m.—that dog’s barking isn’t random. But don’t think I’ll sign anything they pressure me with. My lawyer’s still got copies from last time.

interviewer: I hear how crucial the garden is as your anchor of truth and the 3 a.m. footage as key evidence in your pattern of distrust. Before we finalize next steps, is there anything else I’ve missed about how these elements connect to your experiences?

patient: I suppose you’re missing how HR’s ‘random’ reviews always line up with the dog’s 3 a.m. barking. It’s not a coincidence—they’re testing if I’ll crack under sleepless pressure. My lawyer says the footage proves it, but you’ll just call it ‘overthinking.’ To be honest, I’m done explaining myself. Either check the records or don’t. I’ll spot their tricks again, like last time.

interviewer: I hear how the alignment between HR reviews and the 3 a.m. barking feels like a deliberate strategy to destabilize you, and how your documented records are your primary defense against being misunderstood or manipulated. Before we discuss next steps, is there anything else I’ve missed about how these elements connect to your experiences?

patient: You’re still missing how they’re using the noise to mess with my head. The garden’s the only place I can think straight, but you’ll just say it’s ‘overthinking.’ Either check the footage or don’t—I’ll find the truth myself.

interviewer: I hear how the 3 a.m. noise feels like a deliberate test of your stability and how the garden remains your only reliable anchor. Before we finalize next steps, is there anything else I’ve missed about how these elements connect to your experiences?

patient: I suppose you’re missing how the dog’s schedule matches every ‘random’ audit they’ve thrown at me. The footage proves it’s timed, but you’ll just call it a coincidence. My lawyer says to document everything—garden, barking, HR’s ‘coincidences.’ But don’t think I’ll let them twist this into another trap. Either check the records or don’t. I’ll spot their tricks again.
