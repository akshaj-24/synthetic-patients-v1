system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Heather. I want to make sure we take this at a comfortable pace for you. Can you confirm you're okay with us proceeding with this session today?

patient: Sure... I mean, I don’t see a choice, really. Might as well get it over with. Just, uh—try not to keep me too late. Landlord’s been breathing down my neck about that late fee again.

interviewer: That sounds really tough. Before we move forward, is there anything about the session today or the process that you'd like to clarify or ask about first?

patient: No, this is fine. Just... trying to keep the landlord from raising my rent again. Adulting’s harder than they promised, you know. I’ll be okay. As long as I can get this done and... uh... check on Mochi later.

interviewer: It sounds like you're managing a lot right now. Do you understand that this session will involve discussing your current concerns and exploring how we can support you?

patient: Yeah, I get it. Just... try not to make me late for my shift. I’ll need to pick up Mochi after this—she’s been... uh... avoiding me lately. Landlord stuff, work stuff, it’s all just part of the package, right? I’ll be fine as long as the ivy doesn’t die. It’s survived worse.

interviewer: Can you tell me what's been most difficult for you lately that's brought you here today?

patient: It’s... everything, I guess? The shifts are killing me, but the landlord’s threats are worse. You can’t really plan anything when you’re worried about where the next rent check is coming from. And Mochi’s been... distant lately. She used to follow me around the apartment, now she hides whenever I get home. I guess cats are like people—when you’re a mess, they just... retreat. But I’ll figure it out. Adulting’s a marathon, right? Just lots of small disasters adding up.

interviewer: That sounds really heavy to carry alone. When did the landlord's threats first start becoming a problem for you?

patient: It’s... been a few months, maybe? Right around when the divorce was finalizing. Landlords don’t exactly have a ‘grace period’ for life falling apart, you know. I guess I just kept telling myself I’d handle it once the night shifts evened out... but they didn’t. (Adjusts necklace, pauses.) The ivy’s still alive, though. That’s something, right?

interviewer: It sounds like this fog has been really challenging to navigate alone. Have you experienced episodes like this before, where you felt stuck in a fog with low energy and lack of interest?

patient: I... I don’t know if it’s ‘episodes.’ I’ve always been the type to grind through stress, you know? Like, my mom used to call me a ‘slow-burn’—which I guess worked for years. But this feels... heavier. The fog’s not just about work or deadlines. It’s like even the ivy’s green spots feel like a miracle now. (Pauses, fiddles with coffee stirrer.) Wait, that sounds dramatic. I’m just tired, right? Probably just... tired.

interviewer: It sounds like you've managed stress before but this feels different. Have you experienced periods like this where the stress felt heavier or the usual ways of coping weren't enough?

patient: It’s not like I’ve never had stress before... I mean, my mom used to say I was a ‘slow-burn’ for a reason. But this? This feels like the fire’s under the ivy now, and I’m just... watering the wrong pot. (Adjusts necklace, pauses.) I guess I’m used to pushing through, but even that’s... harder. Like, even the ‘gritting my teeth’ part feels like too much lately. You know?

interviewer: It sounds like this is different from how you usually handle stress. Have you experienced other times in your life when you felt similarly stuck or overwhelmed, even if it wasn't as intense as now?

patient: There was... that time after college, maybe? When I was trying to juggle grad school applications and my part-time job. Felt like I was just... keeping all the plates spinning. But this? This is like the plates are cracked and I’m worried they’ll shatter if I breathe too hard. (Adjusts necklace, hesitates.) I guess I’m used to the cracked plates, though. This feels newer. More... fragile.

interviewer: It sounds like this current situation feels more fragile than past challenges. Have you had similar episodes in the past where you felt overwhelmed like this, and if so, what helped you get through them?

patient: I’ve never really... you know, had a playbook for this. Usually, I just throw more hours at it. If the spreadsheets can stay organized, so can I. But this time... (adjusts necklace) even the spreadsheets look like scribbles. Maybe I need a different kind of fix.

interviewer: It sounds like your usual strategies aren't working as well now. When you faced that cracked-plate period after college, what specific strategies or supports helped you keep things from shattering back then?

patient: Hmm. Back then... I think I just... buried myself in spreadsheets. Like, if I could track every hour and task, nothing would catch me off guard. And there was this friend, Lisa—she’d call me out if I skipped meals. But honestly? I was terrible at asking for help. Just... ground through it. Now? The spreadsheets feel like a lie. I’ll start one, then stare at it for an hour and nothing happens. Maybe I’m just... more tired this time? My hands don’t even stop shaking long enough to type straight.

interviewer: It sounds like asking for help has been really hard for you, especially now when even small tasks feel overwhelming. Have you ever sought professional support or therapy during previous challenging times, and if so, what was your experience like?

patient: Honestly, I haven’t. I mean, I’ve never been great at asking for help, even when I needed it. Back then, I just... buried myself in work and spreadsheets. Thought I could power through. Now? The idea of therapy feels... like another task I’d mess up. Or another bill I can’t afford.

interviewer: I want to check in about your safety. Have you been having any thoughts about ending your life or harming yourself in any way?

patient: I... I guess I’ve had those thoughts. Not like I’d do anything, though. Just... sometimes I stare at the pill bottle and wonder if I’d just sleep through the night if I did. But it’s more like a weird science question, you know? Like, what if I let go entirely? The ivy’s putting out new leaves, though. And Mochi still purrs when I finally pick him up. So I figure... I’ll keep going for their sake. At least until the spreadsheet makes sense again.

interviewer: That sounds like a really heavy thing to carry... Have you ever considered a specific way you might act on those thoughts of taking the pills?

patient: No... it’s not like I’ve planned anything. Just... sometimes I wonder. But then I think about the ivy’s new leaves, and I tell myself I should water them instead. Mochi’s starting to eat my slippers again, so I guess I owe it to the furniture to keep going. Honestly, the idea of actually... you know, figuring out a *way*? Feels like another task I’d botch. My brain’s too fried to even Google ‘what happens if’ anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like energy has been really low lately... Have you noticed any times when you feel unusually energetic or need very little sleep, even when you're stressed?

patient: No... I’ve just been really tired, even when I’m not doing much. The night shifts don’t help. I used to think if I just... forced myself to stick to a routine, I’d feel better. But even that’s hard now. The ivy, though—it’s finally putting out new leaves. Maybe I’ll have more energy when... well, never mind.

interviewer: It sounds like the ivy's new leaves offer a small sense of hope... Do you currently have access to any medications or other means that could be used to harm yourself?

patient: I... I have my sleep aids, but I’d never hurt myself. Just help me sleep through the nights. (She fidgets with her necklace, pausing.) The ivy’s new leaves are the only thing keeping me from feeling like I’m entirely failing at... everything. I guess.

interviewer: Can you tell me about any medications or supplements you're currently taking, including your sleep aids?

patient: It’s just the sleep aids my doctor gave me—nothing fancy, just to help me... you know, rest. And I drink a lot of chamomile tea. It’s kind of a stupid ritual, but it makes me feel like I’m doing something right. (She adjusts her necklace, avoiding eye contact.) I take them as needed. Not like they’re a big deal or anything.

interviewer: It sounds like the chamomile tea is a meaningful part of your routine... Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or drug use lately, even if they seem small?

patient: No, not really. I mean, the tea’s… it’s just something I do. Keeps me from thinking too much, I guess. (She twists the stirrer in her hand.) The sleep aids are only when I can’t rest, but they’re not a big deal. Just part of the job, keeping the lights on, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like the tea and sleep aids are part of your routine to cope with stress... Have you been using alcohol or cannabis lately, even occasionally?

patient: No, nothing like that. I stick to the legal stuff, you know? (Adjusts necklace, forced smile.) The tea’s bad enough. Work’s been… work. But Mochi’s finally letting me pet her again, so that’s something. (Trails off, fidgets with coffee stirrer.)

interviewer: It sounds like your routine with Mochi and the ivy gives you some stability... Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or feeling overly suspicious of people around you?

patient: No, nothing like that. I mean... I guess I get a little on edge sometimes, you know? Like when Mochi stops purring and I wonder if I did something wrong. But it’s not like I’m seeing things or... (adjusts necklace, pauses) Just, maybe feeling off-kilter? Like the world’s moving faster than me, but I can’t explain it. The ivy’s still growing, though. That’s what matters.

interviewer: Heather, based on our conversation, it sounds like the main challenges you’ve been facing include feeling overwhelmed by daily tasks, a persistent low mood, and stress related to your divorce, financial pressures, and work demands. These have led to changes in your energy, sleep, and motivation, and you’ve mentioned some passive thoughts about escape, though you’re holding onto caring for Mochi and your ivy as reasons to keep going. What did I miss?

patient: I think you got the big pieces... though maybe you missed how the pill-bottle staring happens more often than I admit. And the landlord’s threats? They’re this... constant hum in the background, making it harder to focus on anything else. But honestly, most days it feels like just keeping the ivy alive is the only victory I can handle. I guess that’s why I water it twice a day—proof I haven’t completely forgotten how to care for anything.

interviewer: Heather, what I’m hearing is that the landlord’s threats have been a persistent stressor, contributing to your low mood and exhaustion, while caring for the ivy feels like a small but meaningful way to maintain a sense of purpose. The pill-bottle staring reflects passive thoughts about escape, which you’ve been managing by focusing on small daily victories. Does this capture your experience, or is there something I’ve missed?

patient: Yeah, that’s... that’s pretty close. The landlord thing is like a background noise you can’t drown out, even when you’re trying to focus on the ivy’s new leaves. And the pill-bottle moments—they’re not about wanting to *do* anything, just... wondering if the weight of the bottle matches how empty I feel. I guess Mochi’s purring sometimes cuts through it, but most days I’m just... here, watering the plant and hoping the cracks in the planter don’t spread. [Adjusts necklace nervously.] It’s weird how the small stuff feels like the only anchor.

interviewer: Heather, based on our discussion, I understand that your current challenges involve managing persistent stressors like financial instability and work demands, while relying on small routines like caring for your ivy and Mochi to maintain a sense of purpose. The passive thoughts about escape feel tied to emotional overwhelm rather than active intent. Is there anything important we haven’t addressed yet, or what would be most helpful for us to focus on next?

patient: I think... the night shifts might be worse than I let on. My boss says I’m ‘consistent’ despite the errors, but I’m just tired enough to second-guess every decision. [Adjusts necklace, pauses.] And maybe the fact that I keep canceling Mochi’s vet appointments ‘for budget reasons’ when I know she’s been coughing? I tell myself it’s ‘responsible’ to prioritize the rent... but then I stare at the pill bottle longer. Does that matter?

interviewer: Heather, what I’m hearing is that the night shifts are adding to your exhaustion and self-doubt, while delaying Mochi’s vet care reflects the pressure of financial instability. The pill-bottle moments still feel like a metaphor for emptiness rather than active intent, and your focus on small routines (the ivy, Mochi’s purring) keeps you anchored. Does this align with your experience, or is something else important to clarify?

patient: Yeah, that’s... that’s pretty much it. The shifts just *drain* me, you know? I tell myself I’m ‘pulling through,’ but half the time I’m just waiting for the clock to hit 6 AM. And Mochi—she’s been coughing for weeks, but I keep telling myself ‘maybe it’s nothing’... [adjusts necklace, voice softens] It’s like the ivy, though. If I ignore the brown spots long enough, they’ll just... take over. I’m scared of that.

interviewer: It sounds like the night shifts are adding a heavy layer to your already full plate, and Mochi’s health is another piece you’re trying to hold together without cracking. Let me try to put this all into a clearer picture: your current struggles seem tied to a mix of long-term stressors like financial pressure and work demands, recent changes like your divorce, and patterns of pushing through fatigue while avoiding harder decisions (like vet visits). The small routines—ivy care, Mochi’s purring—act like lifelines, keeping you grounded when everything else feels like it might collapse. Does this fit what you’re experiencing, or is there something I’ve missed in how we’re connecting the dots?

patient: Yeah, that’s... that’s pretty much it. The shifts just *drain* me, you know? I tell myself I’m ‘pulling through,’ but half the time I’m just waiting for the clock to hit 6 AM. And Mochi—she’s been coughing for weeks, but I keep telling myself ‘maybe it’s nothing’... [adjusts necklace, voice softens] It’s like the ivy, though. If I ignore the brown spots long enough, they’ll just... take over. I’m scared of that.
