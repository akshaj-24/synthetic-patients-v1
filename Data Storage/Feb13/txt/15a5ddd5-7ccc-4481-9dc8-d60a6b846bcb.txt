system: Session 15a5ddd5-7ccc-4481-9dc8-d60a6b846bcb transcript

system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Dustin, just to confirm, you're comfortable with us discussing your current concerns today? We'll start by talking about what's been going on, and then I'll ask some questions to understand better how I can support you. Does that sound okay?

patient: Everything’s fine, really! ...I mean, it’s just, you know, work stuff. The job’s been eating at me a bit. Let me put it this way—if my tools weren’t all organized, I’d probably lose one in the garage by now. To be honest, I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night, checking my phone for messages. You’d think I’d be used to it by now, but… yeah, it’s like my brain’s a Wi-Fi signal that’s always buffering. You catch my drift?

interviewer: That sounds really tough to manage. Are you comfortable with us proceeding to explore this further today?

patient: Yeah, I guess. As long as we don’t spend too much time on the obvious stuff. I’ve been so tired lately, like my batteries are drained. Even building birdhouses—something stupidly simple—feels like climbing a mountain now. But... we can talk. Might as well.

interviewer: It sounds like the stress from work has been really heavy on you lately. When did you first notice these feelings of being overwhelmed and having trouble sleeping starting?

patient: Hard to pin down the exact start date, but... maybe six months ago? After that shelving project went sideways. Client was unhappy, boss started giving me the side-eye—suddenly my brain’s a Wi-Fi signal that won’t stop buffering. Sleep? Yeah, I’ve been up at 2 a.m. double-checking if I paid the electric bill or if I left the garage light on. It’s just... nonstop.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly draining... How has this been affecting your interactions with your wife or other relationships lately?

patient: It’s... complicated. I mean, she’s not *mad* exactly, but you can see it in her eyes sometimes. Like when I leave the garage a mess or forget she asked me to clean up. I just... freeze, you know? To be honest, I’ve been so focused on work and the truck’s repair costs piling up that I don’t even notice the little things anymore. She’s been drinking more of my beer too—maybe to cope? I try to act like everything’s fine, but sometimes I catch myself thinking, What if I’m just... broken? Like a wobbly shelf that can’t hold anything. But we still... laugh sometimes. When she’s not looking at me like I’m the problem.

interviewer: It sounds like the strain on your relationship with your wife has been both frustrating and isolating... What are you hoping to achieve through this process or what would you most like to work on right now?

patient: I guess... I want to stop feeling like I’m always one mistake away from everything falling apart. It’s not just the work stuff—it’s like my brain won’t let me relax, even when there’s no reason to stress. My wife deserves someone who’s not... shaking at the seams all the time. But I don’t know how to fix it. Even when I try to focus, my head’s still checking every tool, every bill, every... stupid thing. It’s exhausting.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure has been building up over months and affecting your sense of stability... How has this constant worry impacted your ability to enjoy activities you used to like, like building birdhouses?

patient: It’s like... I used to lose track of time building those birdhouses, but now my brain’s always counting the hours I should be ‘fixing’ something else. Even when I try, my hands feel too shaky to get the cuts right. I end up just... leaving the wood sitting there. Stupid, right? Parks and Rec? I still hit ‘play’ every weekend, but half the time I can’t follow the jokes. My wife teases me—‘Dustin, it’s just a show!’—but I know what she means. I used to get it. Now... I’m just trying not to crash.

interviewer: That sounds really tough... Have you experienced similar periods of stress and anxiety in the past, and if so, what helped you manage it?

patient: I’ve always been a worrier, I guess. When things got tight before, I just... threw myself into work, tried to outwork it. Or drank a couple beers to unclench. My dad used to say I wasted time on perfect joints—now my hands just shake too much to make ’em anyway. The birdhouses... I used to lose myself in ’em. Now I can’t even finish a cut without second-guessing. It’s like the old tricks aren’t working this time.

interviewer: It sounds like the strategies that used to help you manage stress aren't as effective now. Have you noticed any specific changes in your work or home life that might be contributing to this shift?

patient: Work’s been... tighter, I guess. My boss’s been giving me that look—the one that says ‘you’re one typo away from getting fired’—and the client纠纷 still haunts me like a bad smell in the workshop. At home, my wife’s patience’s wearing thinner than 2x4s, and I’m just... here, trying not to drop the ball on everything. It’s like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall. I finish one task, and three more pop up. The beers don’t even loosen me up anymore. They just make my hands less shaky... for like, ten minutes. My birdhouses? I can’t even sand the wood without second-guessing if I’m wasting time. Stupid, right? I’m just... a walking to-do list with no ‘complete’ button.

interviewer: It sounds like your work and home pressures are really piling up. Who are some people you feel you can count on for support when things feel overwhelming?

patient: Honestly? I... I don’t wanna sound like a complainer, but it’s like I’m supposed to be the support, not the one needing it. My wife’s the only one I can really talk to, but half the time I feel like I’m just adding to her stress. She’s got her own health stuff to deal with—asking her to carry my weight? That’s not fair. The guys at work... they seem to have it together, but I can’t exactly go asking them about my truck repairs or the birdhouse mess. They’d just say ‘man up’ or whatever. To be honest? I usually just power through. Two beers, a deep breath, and I tell myself I’m ‘nailing this.’ Even if my hands are still shaking.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of responsibility while feeling isolated in your struggles. Have you experienced similar periods of stress and anxiety in the past, and if so, what helped you manage it back then?

patient: To be honest, I’ve always handled stress by... working myself to the bone, you know? Like, if the shelving project went sideways six months ago, I just doubled up on overtime, drank a couple more beers to unwind, and told myself I’d ‘figure it out.’ But this time feels different. The shaking in my hands won’t quit, even when I’m trying to focus. My wife used to laugh about me building birdhouses to ‘unwind,’ but lately I can’t even finish them without second-guessing every damn joint. It’s like... the old tricks aren’t cutting it, but I’m too scared to admit I need help fixing whatever’s broken here.

interviewer: It sounds like you're managing a lot of pressure right now. Have you ever had thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life?

patient: No, I... I haven’t gone there. Not exactly. But sometimes I feel like I’m stuck in this... this vice. Like the walls are closing in, you know? I just keep telling myself, ‘Dustin, breathe. You’ve gotten through worse.’ But the shaking in my hands? It’s constant now. Even when I’m trying to sleep, my mind’s just... recalculating every mistake. I guess I’d rather collapse a shelf than... than admit I can’t hold it up anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like the physical symptoms are really distressing for you. How much alcohol do you typically consume in a week, and has there been any change in your use recently?

patient: I’ve always had a couple of beers to unwind, you know? Like, two most nights. It’s not a problem or anything. But lately, even that doesn’t really... take the edge off like it used to. Feels like I’m just... buffering in place.

interviewer: It sounds like the alcohol isn’t providing the relief it used to. Have you used any other substances—like marijuana, stimulants, or pain medications—to help with your anxiety or sleep lately?

patient: No, I haven’t messed with anything else. Painkillers? Nah. I’m not that guy. Maybe... maybe a couple years back I tried edibles once after a roofing job left me wrecked, but it just made the shaking worse. Feels like my body’s running a virus or something. Now I just... count pills in my head? Don’t know. It’s like my brain’s a leaky roof and I’m trying to plug the holes with duct tape and bad jokes.

interviewer: It sounds like you're managing a lot of pressure right now. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal products?

patient: No meds, prescription or otherwise. Just the two beers most nights—like I said, not a problem. Maybe... maybe some ibuprofen if my back’s acting up from overtime, but that’s it. The boss says I’m ‘bulletproof,’ you know? Hah. Keeps me busy, at least.

interviewer: It sounds like the alcohol isn’t providing the same relief it once did. Have you noticed any changes in how much you drink or when you choose to drink lately?

patient: You know, I’m like a Wi-Fi signal—constantly buffering. The beers... I guess I do have them a bit more when the day’s rough. They don’t really take the edge off anymore, though. Just leave me tired. And my hands still shake like a leaf even after a drink.

interviewer: It sounds like the shaking is really affecting your energy and ability to relax. Have you ever experienced periods where you felt unusually energetic or had a lot of ideas that made it hard to focus, even when you were tired?

patient: No, not really. I mean, I used to think working overtime would help me keep up, but now it’s like... my brain’s stuck on repeat. Just the same worries looping. The beers used to make me feel like I could keep going, but now they just make me crash faster. It’s like my body’s running on low battery all the time.

interviewer: Let me try to summarize what I’ve heard so far: For about six months, work stress has been causing you to feel overwhelmed, with racing thoughts, sleep problems, and physical symptoms like hand tremors. This has affected your concentration, job performance, and relationship with your wife, who’s also been trying to cope with her own health issues. You’ve used overworking and alcohol to manage, but those aren’t helping anymore. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: Yeah, that’s... that’s pretty much it. I guess you missed the part where the truck’s about to die. Another two grand I don’t have. But I didn’t want to add to the mess. And the birdhouses? Used to be my stupid escape, but even that’s just another thing I can’t finish. My hands won’t stop shaking, so...

interviewer: It sounds like the financial strain around the truck and the frustration with unfinished projects are adding to the pressure you're already under. What did I miss or get wrong about how these factors are connecting to your stress and shaking hands?

patient: The truck’s like another shelving project that’s already collapsed before I start. I keep thinking if I just save up, maybe I can fix it, but it’s another thing waiting to go wrong. The hands… yeah, they shake more when I think about it. Even the birdhouses feel like a joke now—how’m I supposed to build something steady when everything’s a mess?

interviewer: What I’m hearing is that your sense of stability—both in projects like the truck and in your hands—feels eroded by ongoing stress, and that even small creative outlets now feel tainted by self-doubt. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: Yeah, that’s... spot on. The truck’s just another thing I can’t even start fixing without my hands betraying me. And the birdhouses? They’re like these stupid little mirrors—every time I try to make something simple, I end up drilling through the base. My wife used to laugh at my ‘stupidly simple’ hobby, but now she just sighs when I even pick up a hammer. I guess... I guess the real problem is I can’t even trust my own grip anymore. Literally or figuratively. Everything’s one shaky mistake away from falling apart.

interviewer: It sounds like the combination of physical symptoms, work pressures, and relationship strain has created a cycle where even small tasks feel unstable. What would you like to prioritize as we move forward—exploring strategies for managing the shaking, improving sleep, or addressing the stress at work?

patient: I—I don’t know. The shaking’s constant, like my hands are made of wet cardboard. But the truck… that’s a real problem. If that dies, it’s another thing to… to fall apart on. Maybe start there? But the sleep’s trash too. I just… I keep thinking if I fix the truck, maybe the rest’ll stop feeling so wobbly. Probably not, though.

interviewer: I hear how the truck’s instability and your physical symptoms are both practical and symbolic stressors for you. Let me try to piece this together: Over the past six months, work pressures and financial worries have intensified your anxiety, leading to sleep trouble, shaking hands, and a sense of losing control in both practical tasks and relationships. Even hobbies that once helped now feel like failures, and your wife’s growing frustration adds to the weight. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You’re close, but… the part about the birdhouses being failures? That’s not it. They’re just… slower now. Like my hands won’t keep up with the thoughts. And the beer? Doesn’t numb it anymore—just makes the shaking feel like static. My wife… she’s not angry. Just tired. I can see it when she looks at me. Like she’s waiting for me to snap, but I can’t even do that right.

interviewer: It sounds like the birdhouses still matter to you, but the shaking and mental fog are slowing you down, and the beer’s become part of the static instead of the relief. Your wife’s exhaustion adds to the weight of everything feeling unsteady. What else feels important to correct or add here before we talk about next steps?

patient: I think you got the main beams right, but… there’s this fog, you know? Like my brain’s stuck in a sandstorm. The birdhouses… they’re not slower, exactly. Just… my hands won’t listen. Like when you try to cut a board but your saw’s off-kilter. And the beer? It’s like wrapping a splinter in duct tape—numbs nothing, just makes you forget why you bothered. Maybe… maybe the real thing is the fog. It’s like I’m trying to build a deck in a hurricane. You ever try that? Everything just… bends.

interviewer: I hear how the 'fog' feels like the core of what's making everything bend, even more than the shaking or the truck—like your whole foundation's shifting in a storm. Let me try to capture that: For six months, work stress, financial strain, and this mental fog have created a cycle where even small tasks feel unstable, your hands betray you, and coping strategies like alcohol or hobbies now feel like part of the problem. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You’re… not wrong. The fog’s like a storm inside my head, right? Even sawing a straight line feels like trying to nail jello. The beer? It’s just… background noise now. Doesn’t mute the static, just makes me forget why I opened the bottle. And my wife—she’s not angry. Just… tired. Like I’m this leaky pipe she’s constantly patching. But the patches? They’re just… bending under the pressure.

interviewer: What I’m hearing is that the mental fog feels like the central storm making everything wobbly—your hands, your focus, even the relief you once got from beer. It’s like trying to build in a hurricane, where everything bends, and your wife’s exhaustion adds to the weight. What did I miss or get wrong about how these pieces connect for you?

patient: Yeah, the fog’s the hurricane, sure. But it’s like trying to build a deck with warped lumber—every cut’s off, and I don’t even notice till it’s too late. The truck… I can’t even think straight about fixing it. Feels like another leak in a pipe that’s already rusted through. And the beer? It’s just… background noise. Doesn’t cut through the fog, just makes me forget why I opened the bottle. My wife—she’s not angry. Just… tired. Like I’m this… half-built shelf she’s trying to prop up with duct tape.

interviewer: I hear how the 'fog' feels like the central hurricane making everything wobbly, and how the truck, your hands, and your wife’s exhaustion are all part of that storm. What would you most like to focus on next—exploring strategies for the fog, addressing the physical shaking, or working through the stress around the truck and relationships?

patient: I don’t know... maybe the truck? It’s just another thing I can’t plan for. I mean, I’ve been putting off the repairs, but what if it dies on me? Then it’s another... another *shelf* collapsing before I’m ready. My hands shake when I think about the cost. Beers used to help me sleep, but now I just stare at the ceiling, counting all the ways I’m failing. To be honest, I’m tired of picking at the edges. Everything feels connected, like... like a wobbly frame. If one joint gives, the whole thing goes. But maybe that’s just me being dramatic. Let me put it this way—can we talk about how I can stop feeling like I’m one screw away from falling apart?

interviewer: I hear how the truck’s uncertainty and the ‘fog’ are both practical and symbolic of feeling unsteady, like one misstep could unravel everything. Let me try to tie this together: Over six months, work stress, financial strain, and this mental fog have created a cycle where even small tasks feel unstable, your hands betray you, and coping strategies like beer now feel ineffective. The truck feels like another potential ‘screw’ in that wobbly frame. What did I miss or get wrong here before we discuss next steps?

patient: You’re not wrong... but maybe the part where I can’t even trust my hands to do the basics? They still shake when I’m trying to tighten a bolt, let alone... anything else. The beer just leaves me stuck in this loop of ‘buffering’—you know, that Wi-Fi thing I mentioned? And my wife... she’s tired of me being tired. It’s all just... loops. I try to fix one thing, and another breaks. I don’t know how to stop it.

interviewer: I hear how the fog and the truck’s uncertainty feel deeply intertwined in this cycle of instability. What would you most like to explore first as we consider strategies to help—addressing the mental fog, the physical shaking, or practical steps for the truck and relationships?

patient: I think... the hands. The shaking’s making me second-guess every cut, every bolt. If I can’t even hold the tools steady, what’s the point of planning? The truck’s a mess too, but maybe fixing the hands is the first screw we need to tighten before anything else falls apart. To be honest, it feels like the fog’s just... waiting for me to drop the hammer.

interviewer: I hear how the shaking hands feel like the central 'screw' holding up the whole wobbly frame—both practically and symbolically. Let me try to frame this: Your work stress and perfectionism (predisposing), combined with the failed shelving project (precipitating), have led to hypervigilance, sleep disruption, and physical symptoms like tremors (perpetuating). Your wife’s support and past coping strategies like birdhouses are protective factors. What did I miss or get wrong about how these pieces connect before we finalize next steps?

patient: I think you missed how my dad’s voice still shows up when I’m trying to focus. Like, when my hands shake tightening a bolt, I hear him sayin’ ‘wasted time on imperfect joints’—it’s like the fog has his static in it. And the truck… yeah, the repair costs are a secret I haven’t told my wife. It’s another leak I’m patching with duct tape and beer, but the shaking gets worse just thinkin’ about it. The beers don’t even mute that part anymore.

interviewer: I hear how your dad’s critical voice feels woven into the fog, making the shaking and self-doubt feel inevitable, and how the truck’s financial secret adds to the weight of hiding struggles. What else feels important to correct or add before we finalize next steps?

patient: I guess... the part where the beers don’t even mute the static anymore. It’s like I’m holding that match in the dark, but the wind keeps snuffin’ it out. And the birdhouses—stupidly simple, right?—I can’t even force myself to start one. feels like another screw rusted in place.

interviewer: I hear how the static of the beers and the rusted birdhouses feel like they’re deepening the sense of being stuck. What else feels important to correct or add before we finalize next steps?

patient: I guess... I’m just a walking list of things that break. The truck, my hands shaking when I try to fix anything, the way I can’t even finish a birdhouse without second-guessing every damn joint. But it’s stupid, right? Everyone’s got stuff.

interviewer: That metaphor of being a 'walking list of things that break' really captures the weight of these interconnected struggles. What did I miss or get wrong about how the truck, your hands, and the birdhouses all fit into this pattern of feeling unsteady before we talk about next steps?

patient: The truck... it’s like the final nail in a rotten board. I can’t even change the oil without my hands shaking, you know? And the birdhouses—stupid little projects I can’t finish because I’m second-guessing every damn cut. It’s like... I’m waiting for the whole damn shelf to collapse, but I’m too frozen to加固 it. The beers used to mute the static, but now they just make me tired in a way that feels like I’m sinking. Am I making sense or just... buffering again?

interviewer: What I’m hearing is that the truck’s instability, the fog in your mind, and the shaking hands all feel like interconnected parts of a larger system that’s under pressure—like a shelf waiting to collapse. Before we finalize next steps, is there anything else you’d want to correct or add about how these pieces fit together for you?

patient: It’s like... every part of me is a wobbly joint. The truck’s just one more... you know, another thing that’s gonna give out. And my hands—hell, I can’t even hold a beer without shaking sometimes. But it’s stupid, right? My wife’s probably just tired of me bringing up all this crap.

interviewer: I hear how the truck’s financial burden and your body’s 'wobbly joints' feel like they’re deepening the sense of being a 'walking list of things that break.' Before we finalize next steps, is there anything else you’d want to correct or add about how these pieces fit together for you?

patient: It’s the... the way everything feels like it’s waiting for me to drop the ball. The truck’s repair bill—haven’t even told my wife yet. What if she thinks I’m just... another broken thing she’s gotta fix? And my hands, man, I can’t even steady a damn beer bottle sometimes. It’s like my body’s mocking the whole ‘fixer’ thing. But maybe that’s just me overthinking. You know how it is.

interviewer: I hear how the fear of being seen as 'broken'—especially by your wife—adds a layer of shame to the physical and practical struggles. Before we finalize next steps, is there anything else you’d want to correct or add about how these pieces fit together for you?

patient: It’s like... I’m this old shelf she’s trying to reinforce, but every nail I drive just bends. The truck—haven’t even told her about the repair costs yet. What if she sees me as just another... another thing that breaks? I mean, my hands can’t even hold a beer steady half the time. But I’ll be fine, really! Just... buffering, you know?

interviewer: I hear how the fear of being seen as 'broken' by your wife and the truck's financial burden are deeply tied to your sense of instability. Before we finalize next steps, is there anything else you’d want to correct or add about how these pieces fit together for you?

patient: It’s like... every problem feels connected, you know? The truck—haven’t even told my wife about the repair costs yet. Just another thing I can’t fix. My hands still shake when I try to work on it. Feels like I’m failing at everything. But maybe that’s just my Wi-Fi buffering again.

interviewer: I hear how the truck’s financial burden, your body’s instability, and the fear of being seen as ‘broken’ by your wife feel deeply intertwined. What did I miss or get wrong about how these threads connect before we finalize next steps?

patient: I think... maybe I haven’t said how my back feels like it’s in a vise all day. Even after sleeping, it’s still knotted up. And I snap at my wife over stupid stuff—like the garage not being clean. I tell myself it’s ‘just stress,’ but it’s like my fuse is shorter now. I hate that I’m another thing she’s trying to fix.

interviewer: I hear how the back pain and shortened fuse with your wife are adding to the sense of being overwhelmed, even as you try to frame it as 'just stress.' Let me try to capture everything: Over six months, work pressures, financial strain (truck, hidden costs), mental fog, physical symptoms (shaking hands, knotted back), and marital strain (irritability, perceived need for fixing) have created a cycle of feeling like a 'walking list of things that break.' What did I miss or get wrong before we finalize next steps?

patient: I think... maybe you didn’t catch how the little things I used to rely on—like those stupid birdhouses—are now just another thing I can’t finish. The beer doesn’t even loosen me up anymore, just leaves me... wired. Like my body’s stuck on ‘fix this’ but nothing actually needs fixing. It’s the worst.

interviewer: It sounds like there's a lot on your mind with everything you've been through. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up today?

patient: I guess... my back’s still like a vice, and the truck’s another weight I can’t lift. And the beer? Doesn’t even slow the noise down. Just... static. Feels like I’m drowning in it.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy load to carry. What’s been the biggest challenge for you right now that we haven’t addressed?

patient: It’s like my brain’s stuck on repeat, you know? Even when I try to focus on one thing—like figuring out the truck repairs—my mind jumps to ten other things. Feels like I’m running on a broken treadmill... can’t get anywhere but just... worn out.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy load to carry. What would be the most helpful next step for you as we move forward?

patient: Honestly? I’m not sure. I guess... maybe figuring out if there’s a way to stop the shaking long enough to actually fix something? Like, I’ve been avoiding the truck repair costs because what if I can’t cover it? But I’m so tired of just... buffering. My wife keeps asking me to take a break, but if I stop, I feel like everything I’ve half-fixed will just collapse. Maybe if I could at least get a clear estimate on that truck, I could... I don’t know, stop one worry from looping. But I hate asking for help. It’s stupid, right? I’m a carpenter—shouldn’t I be able to fix my own damn life?

interviewer: It’s understandable to feel frustrated when the solutions aren’t clear, especially when you’re used to fixing things. What would you like to prioritize first in addressing the truck or the other worries that feel stuck?

patient: I keep thinking the truck should be first—like if I just get that estimate, maybe the rest of the... noise quiets down. But what if the mechanic says it’s $3k? I can’t even look at my bank account without my hands starting that damn tremor again. My wife’s been nice about it, but I can see her biting her tongue when I mention it. Maybe I should just... stop hedging and admit I can’t fix this alone. But isn’t that what got me here in the first place? Trying to be the guy who handles everything?

interviewer: It sounds like you’re holding a lot of weight right now, and it’s brave to acknowledge that you might not need to carry it all alone. Let’s review what we’ve discussed—what’s one small step you could take this week to address either the truck repairs or the stress around them, even if it’s just gathering information?

patient: Maybe... I could actually look up the repair costs online instead of just staring at the truck until my head throbs. It’s stupid, right? I’ve built cabinets with steady hands, but the second I think about numbers, my fingers start that damn tremor again. I’ll do it tonight after the beer wears off. If I can remember how to breathe while I’m scrolling, instead of just... buffering.
