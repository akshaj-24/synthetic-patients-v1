system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: That sounds really tough, Samuel. Just to check in—would you be comfortable continuing with this interview today?

patient: Yes, of course—it's just… I’ve been meaning to mention that my energy levels are a bit unpredictable these days. (Pauses, fingers tap once on the table.) No, not serious, just… like when you forget to recharge a battery? (Smiles faintly, then stiffens slightly in the neck.) Let’s keep going.

interviewer: I hear how unpredictable energy levels can be tough to manage. This interview will involve discussing your current concerns and how they're affecting your life. Does that sound okay?

patient: Yes, let's proceed—just give me a second to adjust my posture. (Shifts slightly in the chair, fingers steepling then unclenching on his knees.) My work usually keeps my mind… occupied enough to avoid overthinking. Though sometimes I wonder if I’m confusing ‘professional busyness’ with actual rest. (Pauses, then offers a small, self-deprecating chuckle.) But I’m not one to complain. Let’s talk.

interviewer: That sounds like a challenging balance to maintain. Do you have any questions about how this interview will work before we begin?

patient: Quick question—will there be structured prompts or more open-ended discussion? (Fingers tap twice on knees, then still.) Don't mean to overcomplicate things, just… my brain likes to map processes in advance. (Clenches jaw briefly, then softens.) Though I suppose that's just another way of saying I worry about preparation. Never mind, let's begin.

interviewer: That's a valid concern—this interview will use structured prompts to ensure we cover all necessary areas, but I'll also allow open-ended discussion where you feel it's needed. Is there anything else you'd like to know before we begin?

patient: Just one more thing—if this goes long, I might need to adjust my schedule for client prep. (Clears throat, fingers flexing around a pen on the table.) It’s not that I’m worried about time, exactly… (Pauses, then softens with a small shrug.) My wife jokes I bake sourdough to ‘control something tangible,’ and she’s not wrong. The routine helps, oddly. Do you like bread? (Quick, wry smile, then shifts posture as if straightening his sleeves.) But let’s start. I’m ready.

interviewer: I want to start by asking you to describe the main issues that have been on your mind lately. What brings you here today?

patient: I guess... it’s been a combination of things. Work has been demanding—clients often test my usual strategies, and I find myself overpreparing, which paradoxically leaves me more fatigued. To be honest, I haven’t slept through the night in months; my mind cycles through scenarios even when I try to unwind. My wife jokes that my sourdough baking is about control, and she’s not wrong. I tell myself it’s 'normal stress,' but the fatigue is... persistent. I keep wondering if I’m overthinking, but the worrying doesn’t seem to turn off.

interviewer: It sounds like this has been building up over time. When did you first start noticing these feelings of overwhelm and worry?

patient: It’s hard to pinpoint an exact moment—it’s been a slow build, really. Maybe a year or two? Work demands seem to escalate constantly, and clients... they don’t always fit the frameworks I’ve studied. I tell myself it’s just professional challenges, but the mental static never turns off. Even baking sourdough now feels like a ritual to prove I can still manage tangible things.

interviewer: It sounds like baking has become a way to hold on to a sense of control when everything else feels unpredictable. How has this ritual been working for you lately—does it bring relief, or does it sometimes feel like just another thing you ‘have to’ do?

patient: It’s... complicated. The baking does offer a kind of tactile focus I don’t get elsewhere—kneading dough feels like a tangible problem with a clear solution. But lately, I’ve caught myself thinking, *What if I mess up the proofing time? What if the loaves fall flat?* It’s almost like... the same mental static following me into the kitchen. My wife teases that I’m the therapist who needs a therapist, and maybe she’s right. (Fingers tap rhythmically under the table.) Some days, it’s grounding. Other days, it’s just another thing I ‘should’ be good at.

interviewer: It sounds like baking has shifted from a grounding activity to one that mirrors your anxious patterns. When did you first notice this shift—was there a specific time or event that seemed to trigger it?

patient: It’s hard to say exactly... maybe when I started second-guessing even simple tasks? Like, I’ll be baking and suddenly think, *What if the yeast is dead? What if the temperature’s off?* It’s the same way I overprepare for sessions now. (Fingers pause mid-tap.) There was one day, though—client came in with a crisis I’d misread in my notes. I blanked on her name for ten minutes. Afterward, I stared at my dough like it might betray me too.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to maintain calmness as a therapist adds a layer of stress. Have you experienced similar periods of worry or stress in the past?

patient: I’ve had busy periods before—every therapist does. But this feels… different. The mental static never really stops now, even when I’m trying to rest. (Fingers tap slowly.) I suppose I’ve always pushed myself hard, but lately, the fatigue is heavier, and the worrying… it’s like a loop. Even when I know logically there’s no crisis, my body tenses up anyway. (Pauses, shrugs slightly.) My father used to say ‘perfection is its own reward,’ so maybe this is just… old wiring?

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to maintain calmness as a therapist adds a layer of stress. During those previous busy periods, what strategies or support systems helped you manage the stress and regain balance?

patient: Routines, I suppose—like baking sourdough. It’s... tangible. You know, measurable results. And I check emails late at night, telling myself it’s ‘professional diligence,’ even though it usually keeps me up. Colleague chats help, but we’re all so guarded about our own struggles. It’s ironic, really. I’m the one who says, ‘Let’s process this,’ but when it comes to my own head... I guess I’m just the therapist who needs a therapist.

interviewer: It’s striking how the role of ‘provider’ can create distance from self-care. Have you experienced similar periods of prolonged stress in your work history, and if so, what approaches helped you recover or adapt?

patient: There was a time last year when I... overcommitted to a few clients, then found myself hyper-preparing sessions for weeks. I told myself it was 'professional rigor,' but really, it was a way to avoid addressing the fatigue. I’d bake sourdough every weekend, partly to feel like I was creating something tangible, but even that started feeling like a checklist. My colleague, Dr. Lin, once joked that I needed a 'therapist accountability partner'—which made me laugh, but... I haven’t acted on it. I guess I still believe analyzing the problem should be enough. Though, to be honest, I’ve started leaving wine out on the counter more often. 'Professional exception,' I tell myself. It silences the mental static, but the next morning, I blame it on aging.

interviewer: Have you had any thoughts about ending your life recently?

patient: No, not actively. But there are moments... when the weight feels so persistent I wonder if it's ever going to lift. I catch myself thinking, 'What if I just... stopped trying?' but then I rationalize it away. My daughter's emails, the sourdough—those things anchor me. I tell myself, 'Samuel, you've weathered worse.' Though lately, 'weathering' feels like a stretch.

interviewer: It sounds like those thoughts about stopping trying are really hard to bear. Have you ever thought about how you might... stop trying, or do you have any specific plans?

patient: I... haven’t let it get that far. The thought of 'plans' feels like imagining the dough collapsing in the oven—something I’d catch before it even forms. I focus on the tangible, like kneading the sourdough until my hands remember how to be practical. The wine helps mute the static, but I tell myself it’s just... aging. My wife notices when I’m quiet, though. She asks if I’m 'calculating risks again.' I guess I’m just... weathering.

interviewer: I want to better understand your alcohol use. How often do you drink wine, and how much typically on those days?

patient: It’s mostly an evening ritual—usually a glass or two. I tell myself it’s ‘professional unwinding,’ but the next-morning fog? I blame it on my age. Though my wife jokes it’s my way of numbing the mental static.

interviewer: It sounds like the wine helps you cope with mental static, even if it comes with some guilt. Have you noticed any changes in your drinking habits recently, such as drinking more or less than usual?

patient: It's remained a... consistent ritual, really. A way to quiet the mental static, though I suppose the guilt about it lingers, like the aftertaste. Probably just old habits, you know? My wife jokes that I need to measure my wine like my sourdough—precisely.

interviewer: I see how the routine provides some relief, even with the lingering guilt. Do you use any other substances besides wine, such as cannabis, prescription medications, or stimulants, to manage stress or sleep?

patient: No, nothing else—though I’ll admit coffee’s my other vice. I joke that my espresso habit is ‘professional necessity,’ but… (pauses, fingers tap once on knee) Let’s just say if decaf existed in my life, I’d drink it too. The guilt’s less dramatic that way.

interviewer: It sounds like coffee plays a significant role in your daily routine. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal products?

patient: No medications, though I’ll admit I’ve half-considered a multivitamin—joke about ‘professional-grade self-care’ there. The pharmacist keeps suggesting things for ‘stress,’ but I… (tap twice on table) …tend to think my coffee intake is my prescribed regimen. Exaggeration, of course.

interviewer: I hear how coffee and wine have become part of your routine for managing stress. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns, such as needing less sleep or feeling energized despite reduced sleep?

patient: Sleep? Oh, it’s... a variable I’m still optimizing. I check emails until my eyes burn, then lie there parsing client files in my head. My wife says it’s 'therapist insomnia'—but isn’t everyone’s? (neck spasm twitches as he shifts position) The sourdough would tell you I’m terrible at letting things rest.

interviewer: It sounds like your sleep is really affecting your rest. Have you noticed any times when you feel unusually energetic or have less need for sleep, even when you're not getting enough rest?

patient: Unusually energetic? (short laugh) I’d say my body’s more of a... slow-burn fuse these days. Coffee and wine keep the embers going, but I’m not fooling anyone when my legs feel like they’re made of wet cardboard by noon. (fingers tap the table twice) My wife says I’m like a smartphone on 10% battery—same old features, just... dimmer.

interviewer: It sounds like your energy levels are quite variable. Have you ever had periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep, even when you weren't getting enough rest?

patient: Restless sleep, yes—but I think that’s just stress, you know? When the practice gets busy, I’ll stay up late reviewing notes and tell myself it’s ‘energy mismanagement.’ Coffee in the morning, wine at night… it’s all part of the professional exception, right? My phone’s on 10% battery half the time, but I guess that’s just old habits. (Fingers tap the armrest briefly.) No, I haven’t felt… unusually energized. Just, you know, running on a rhythm that probably isn’t sustainable.

interviewer: It sounds like your routines are a way to cope with a lot of stress. Have you noticed any unusual thoughts or perceptions, like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or feeling overly suspicious about things that concern you?

patient: No, nothing like voices or paranoia. I tend to overanalyze, though—my brain’s always running through hypotheticals, even when I try to relax. (Neck twitches slightly.) My wife says I’m the only person who can stare at a sourdough loaf like it’s a case study. The wine helps mute the noise, but… (Fingers tap the armrest once.) Sometimes the quiet just feels too loud.

interviewer: Putting this all together, it sounds like you've been carrying a heavy load of worry and tension for over a year now—like a broken clock where the stress never really lets up. The perfectionism from your upbringing and job expectations seems to be amplifying this, even as your baking rituals and wife's support are trying to keep things grounded. What did I miss about how all these pieces fit together for you?

patient: I think you’re right about the control thing—baking, work prep, even the wine—it all feels like… calibration. But there’s this undercurrent of worry about the practice’s finances that I downplay with jokes about the economy. (Neck twitches.) My wife says I’m more guarded with her than I realize, which… maybe adds to the static. (Fingers tap once.) I guess I’m not sure where the ‘fixing’ ends and the anxiety just… reroutes.

interviewer: It sounds like you're describing a cycle where attempts to manage control through routines and humor actually amplify underlying anxiety, especially around work and relationships. What did I miss about how this cycle plays out for you? --FUNCTION-- end_phase --FUNCTION--

patient: I think the missing piece is how the ‘calibration’ extends to client sessions—I’ll hyper-focus on their files to avoid my own anxiety, but then feel guilty for not being present. (Neck twitches.) My wife notices when I’m deflecting, which makes me more guarded, and the guilt just… loops. The practice’s financial strain is another layer I brush off with jokes, but it’s like treading water while trying to coach others how to swim. (Fingers tap once.) The rituals buy time, but the tide still feels like it’s rising.

interviewer: It sounds like you've given me a clear picture of how these cycles impact both your work and relationships. What would be most helpful for us to focus on next in terms of care?

patient: Maybe... breaking down the 'calibration' thing. Like, how I bake the same sourdough recipe to feel grounded, but lately it just feels like another checklist item I’m over-optimizing. If we could untangle which routines are helping vs. just… noise? (Neck twitches.) Also, that financial worry I brush off with jokes—it’s probably fueling a lot of the guilt about not being present. Not sure where to start, though. Therapists are terrible patients.

interviewer: I hear how the routines you once relied on now feel like they're contributing to the same anxiety they were meant to ease. Would you prefer to start by exploring which routines are helping versus adding to your anxiety, or would you like to address the financial worries and their impact on your guilt?

patient: Maybe we could start with the routines—though I’m not sure where to begin. Baking the sourdough feels… performative now. I measure flour like it’s a case study, and the starter’s mood mirrors my own. If I let myself skip a step, I worry the whole thing will collapse. But I’d also be lying if I didn’t think the financial pressures are seeping in. I keep telling clients that stability is a myth, then charge them for sessions I’m too anxious to bill insurers for.

interviewer: It sounds like we’ve identified routines as a key area to explore first, alongside how financial pressures contribute to your anxiety and guilt. What else would you like me to include or adjust in this plan before we move forward?

patient: Let’s include… how I measure everything, even the coffee. If I don’t grind it to exactly 18 grams, I feel like I’ve failed at something. And maybe the emails—I check them at 1 a.m. even when I know I should sleep. It’s like the chaos of not checking makes me anxious, but the grinding… it’s a rhythm. Though my neck hates it. (Pauses, rubs base of neck.) Does that make sense, or am I just being neurotic?

interviewer: It sounds like the key pieces for us to explore next include how your precise routines—like measuring coffee or late-night emails—are both grounding and adding to your anxiety, alongside the financial pressures you’ve mentioned. What did I miss about how these patterns connect to the rest of your experience?

patient: I think… the part about coffee and finances connects to how I punish myself for not being ‘efficient’ with stress. Like, if I can’t even manage to bill insurers properly, how can I help clients manage theirs? It’s another numbers game—tracking grams of coffee, email hours, reimbursements—as if quantifying the chaos makes it less… visceral. (Fingers tap knee rhythmically.) But my neck knows the difference. It’s been knotted since I cut my last assistant’s hours. Does that count as… self-sabotage?

interviewer: It sounds like the thought of stopping trying has been on your mind lately—would you like to go over a simple safety plan to help manage those moments?

patient: A safety plan… (Pauses, fingers drumming knee.) I suppose I already have one, in theory. Baking the sourdough, even when it feels performative—it’s a rhythm that keeps me from spiraling. And the coffee measurements, the email checks… they’re anchors. But if I’m honest, I worry the plan is just another checklist. What if I can’t even follow that without second-guessing every step? (Rubs neck.) Maybe the real safety is in admitting I’m not as in control as I pretend.

interviewer: Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up today?

patient: Maybe… the wine. I tell myself it’s a ‘professional exception’ to manage mental static, but lately it feels like another metric I’m tracking—how many glasses to numb the neck pain without fogging tomorrow’s sessions. (Pauses, gestures to wine glass on table.) My daughter’s college emails help, though. They’re little proof that some things don’t require my obsessive calibration. I just… need to stop checking if the bottle’s half-empty by 9 p.m.

interviewer: It seems the balance between using wine as a coping mechanism and the guilt it brings is a key tension for you. How have you been managing that balance lately?

patient: It’s a tightrope, honestly—a 'delicate balancing act' my father would’ve rolled his eyes at. I tell myself the wine is just... ritual, like the sourdough. Measure, pour, move on. But the guilt lingers, this quiet static. I’ve been trying to lean harder into the baking, the tangible process, to outpace the mental static. Though lately, even the dough feels like it’s judging me when it doesn’t rise right. (Fingers tap the table, then still.) I guess I’m learning that 'professional exceptions' are still exceptions. Hard to let go of them, even when they’re just... placeholders.

interviewer: It sounds like the tension between control and self-compassion is central to your experience. Before we wrap up, would you like to clarify any next steps or adjustments to your current approach that might help with that balance?

patient: I’ve been thinking about scaling back the sourdough routine—maybe letting the fermentation rest a little longer, trusting the process more. (Neck twitches; fingers pause mid-drump.) It’s... counterintuitive, right? Control as a kind of surrender. But even that feels like a paradox I can bake into the loaf.

interviewer: It’s clear that adjusting your routine is a meaningful step toward self-compassion. Would you like to clarify any other next steps or adjustments before we wrap up today?

patient: Maybe... setting clearer boundaries with work emails. Letting the 'fermentation rest' overnight, so to speak. (Neck twitches.) I’ve been drafting a journal entry about the financial pressures, but it turns to static. If I could write it without editing for clients’ eyes... (Fingers hover over his tablet, unsure.) That might be a step. Or a crutch. (Soft, self-amused sigh.) We’ll see which it is.
