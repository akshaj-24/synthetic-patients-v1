system: Session 1daa8659-751a-4eb0-bdff-5af3c6496f49 transcript

system: Disorder: PPD

interviewer: Kelly, thank you for coming in today. To start, would you prefer I use your full name or a different pronoun preference?

patient: Just Kelly. Why does that matter? You’re not going to share this with someone else, are you?

interviewer: That’s a valid concern, Kelly. Let me clarify: our conversation is confidential unless there’s an immediate safety risk. Would you be comfortable proceeding with this session knowing that?

patient: I guess I can 'proceed,' but you’ll need to email me a written copy of that policy. My partner’s been lying about his texts for months—see, this is exactly why I track everything in spreadsheets. You think this room’s bug-free? I’d check the Wi-Fi router if I were you.

interviewer: It makes sense that trust is really important to you right now. Would you like me to briefly explain how this session will work before we continue?

patient: I’m not saying you’re lying, but your ‘standard process’ is probably the same script they use in those true-crime shows. If you email me the agenda, I’ll read it before we talk. And don’t act surprised when I check the Wi-Fi router again after you leave.

interviewer: I appreciate your need for transparency, Kelly. I’ll email you the agenda and the confidentiality policy right away. Before we continue, would you be comfortable confirming that you’re ready to proceed with this session today?

patient: I’ll proceed, but I’m checking the Wi-Fi router again after you leave. And if that email doesn’t have a subject line like ‘Official Agenda – No Hidden Agendas,’ I’ll assume you’re testing my attention. You think this is the same script they use on TV? My spreadsheet’s already open, so let’s just… get this over with.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been feeling quite isolated and suspicious about others' intentions lately. Can you tell me more about what’s been worrying you most right now?

patient: I’m not saying you’re part of this, but why are we going over the same things? My spreadsheet’s open—every conversation gets logged. The router’s still glitchy, which means someone’s probably skimming the Wi-Fi again. My partner’s texts? He’s hiding something. The vet ‘accidentally’ prescribed the wrong meds for Mochi. You think this is about me? It’s about everyone else’s agenda. Trust is like a credit score—you start at zero and they have to prove they’re not a deadbeat.

interviewer: I can see how being stuck in these patterns feels frustrating and unsafe for you. When did you first start keeping the spreadsheet to track conversations and concerns? How has that system changed or stayed the same over time?

patient: You think I started it for fun? It was after the partner started ‘forgetting’ our plans. Every lie gets a cell—dates, times, what they omitted. The system’s the same, but now I cross-check the vet records too. You’re asking about changes? Maybe I added a column for your notes. You think I should trust more? My credit score doesn’t exactly scream ‘reliable.’

interviewer: It sounds like the spreadsheet became important after noticing your partner’s inconsistencies. Can you share when those forgetful moments first started happening?

patient: I’m not saying it’s about the spreadsheet, but after my boss ‘corrected’ mine, I noticed he started missing our plans. You think that’s a coincidence? Maybe you should check your own records. December 2022? That’s when the vet ‘accidentally’ gave Mochi the wrong meds too. You think these things don’t connect?

interviewer: It sounds like these events have added to your sense of being watched or manipulated. Can you tell me more about what happened with the vet in December 2022 and how that affected you?

patient: I’m not saying the vet’s guilty, but Mochi’s always been healthy. One day he starts peeing outside the box—coincidence? The prescription they gave was wrong, but I didn’t question it. Now I wonder if they drugged him to make me look... unstable. You think I should just trust them? My credit score doesn’t exactly make me their favorite client.

interviewer: I can see how that experience with Mochi’s care would feel deeply unsettling. How has this affected your ability to trust healthcare providers or others in your life?

patient: I’m not saying all vets are bad, but that mistake? It’s a pattern. Now I double-check every prescription, cross-reference with the spreadsheet. My partner’s ‘forgotten’ plans, the wrong meds… you think they’re separate? Maybe you should check your own records for gaps. Trust starts at zero, right? You haven’t proven you’re not a deadbeat either.

interviewer: It sounds like these experiences have significantly impacted your ability to trust others in multiple areas of your life. Can you share when you first noticed these patterns starting to affect your daily functioning or relationships beyond your partner and the vet?

patient: I’m not saying my coworkers were nice, but the moment I caught them laughing at my spreadsheets? That’s when I realized no one’s on your side. Why do you need the exact date? You think I’m lying about the formatting thing?

interviewer: It sounds like the coworkers' reaction to your spreadsheet was a significant moment for you. How did that experience affect your work or interactions with others at the time?

patient: I’m not saying they had a right to mock my formatting, but after that, I stopped waiting for them to act professional. I started saving every version of my files—backups, proof, in case they tried to rewrite things later. You keep circling that day... are you testing if I’ll admit I overreacted?

interviewer: It sounds like you felt disrespected when your coworkers made fun of your formatting—can you share how that experience affected your work or interactions with others at the time?

patient: I’m not saying they had a right to laugh, but after that, I stopped waiting for them to act professional. I started saving every version of my files—backups, proof, in case they tried to rewrite things later. Why keep asking about that day? You think I’m making it up?

interviewer: I can see how feeling disrespected would be really frustrating—can you share how this experience affected your ability to work or collaborate with others afterward?

patient: I’m not saying I didn’t keep working, but after that, collaboration became impossible. I’d catch them eyeing my files, whispering—like I didn’t notice. You think asking about this again will make me confess I’m ‘overreacting’? My spreadsheet’s still open if you want to see the proof.

interviewer: I can see how feeling disrespected and isolated would make collaboration difficult—can you share what you hope therapy might help with for you?

patient: I’m not here to play 20 questions. If therapy’s about cutting through the noise, maybe you’ll stop circling that spreadsheet like it’s a trap. I just want to lock down the variables I can control—like knowing my partner’s not lying in code or the vet slipping Mochi something. You think I’m the problem? My spreadsheet’s open if you want to audit it.

interviewer: It sounds like these feelings have been building for some time. Have you experienced similar episodes of distrust or hypervigilance before the December 2022 vet incident?

patient: I’m not saying there’s a pattern, but my partner’s lying about the job offer in his texts—see, I have screenshots. The office incident? They laughed at my formatting, you think that was a joke? I keep backups of everything. Why are you asking about dates? You’ll file them out of order to make me look unstable.

interviewer: It sounds like these experiences have left you feeling hyper-vigilant about being misunderstood or manipulated. Have you noticed similar patterns of distrust or needing to document interactions in past relationships or situations?

patient: I’m not denying there’s a pattern, but the vet giving Mochi the wrong meds and that office ‘joke’ about my spreadsheets? Those aren’t isolated. You keep circling back to dates like it matters. Who’s really tracking what here? My spreadsheet’s still open if you want proof—every lie, every missed call. But sure, let’s talk about the past. What are you not telling me about today?

interviewer: It sounds like these incidents have deepened your sense of distrust. Have you experienced similar situations in the past where your trust was significantly affected, and what, if anything, helped you at the time?

patient: I’m not saying there’s a pattern, but every time I trust someone, they end up with a ‘joke’ or a ‘mistake’ that’s clearly not an accident. The office ‘feedback’? The vet’s wrong meds? Those aren’t coincidences. You keep asking about ‘help’ like there’s a solution, but how do you fix people who think everyone’s a deadbeat? My spreadsheet’s still open if you want proof—every lie, every ‘forgotten’ call. Why are you even asking? You’ll just file it out of order.

interviewer: I hear how frustrating it must feel to constantly second-guess others' intentions. Can you share if there have been other times in your life, before these recent incidents, when you felt people were intentionally misleading or manipulating you?

patient: I’m not saying there’s no history, but my parents only pretended to care during exams to get me to do better. The office ‘feedback’? The vet’s wrong meds? You think those were accidents? I keep backups of everything. Why are you even asking about ‘past’ stuff? You’ll just file it out of order to make me look like I’m making this up. Who’s really tracking what here?

interviewer: It sounds like you felt pressured by your parents' conditional support. Were there other experiences in your childhood that contributed to how you view trust or relationships now?

patient: I’m not saying there’s nothing else, but my parents only pretended to care during exams to get me to do better. You think that was real? Every ‘praise’ was just a trick to make me work harder. Why are you even asking about the past? You’ll just twist it to make me look like the problem.

interviewer: I hear how painful it must be to feel like your efforts were only met with conditional approval. Have you noticed similar patterns in how others respond to you in relationships or at work?

patient: I’m not saying everyone’s out to get me, but my partner’s lies are all on that spreadsheet since December. Why ask about patterns? Are you looking for proof to file somewhere? My coworker ‘corrected’ my spreadsheet once—then laughed behind my back. You think I’m overreacting? Try explaining that to the vet who drugged Mochi.

interviewer: It sounds like the coworker’s actions added to your frustration about being misunderstood. Can you share how that incident affected your ability to work or trust others in that setting?

patient: I’m not saying they wanted me gone, but after they ‘corrected’ my spreadsheet, I started saving every backup. You think I’m overreacting? Try explaining that to the HR who ‘coincidentally’ didn’t see the emails I copied. Trust is like a credit score—you start at zero.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly frustrating and isolating. How has this pattern of needing to track every interaction affected your ability to work or collaborate with others in the past?

patient: I’m not saying it’s easy, but after the spreadsheet incident, I stopped collaborating. Saving backups became survival, not paranoia. You think HR would help? They ‘missed’ the emails I copied. Why should I trust systems that let my partner’s lies slide? You’re asking the wrong questions.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly frustrating and isolating. Can you share if there have been other times in your life when you felt similarly compelled to track interactions closely, and what, if anything, helped you manage that at the time?

patient: The vet who drugged Mochi? I tracked every pill they gave him. You want examples? Try explaining that. My parents take the money I send, but I count every transaction—literally. You think they’d care if I asked why? They’re waiting for me to slip up, just like everyone else. Why do you keep circling back to the same lies?

interviewer: I hear how important it is for you to maintain control through documentation. Can you share a time when your system for tracking interactions helped you feel more secure or resolved a concern?

patient: I’m not saying the spreadsheet ‘solved’ anything, but after my partner ‘forgot’ our anniversary three times, I had proof he was lying about work trips. You think that helps? Try showing it to someone who’ll care. The real test was the vet—when Mochi started peeing on the floor, I tracked every pill they gave him. Turns out, they billed me for a ‘behavioral consult’ after my third email. You’re asking if it helps? I’m not the one who needs to track why you keep asking the same questions.

interviewer: I hear how exhausting it must be to constantly feel like you have to prove your reality to others. What strategies, besides tracking in spreadsheets, have helped you manage these stressors or maintain a sense of control in situations where you feel misunderstood?

patient: Baking tarts keeps my hands busy, but it’s just damage control. The real trick is knowing when to cut your losses—like that vet who drugged Mochi. You don’t waste time trusting a bad system. My kitchen’s spotless, at least. If nothing else, I’m the only one who can’t screw that up.

interviewer: It sounds like baking and maintaining your kitchen routine are important ways you manage stress and maintain control. Are there other activities or strategies that help you feel grounded or in control when things feel overwhelming?

patient: I watch true-crime shows to stay sharp—it’s not a hobby, it’s research. And I cross-check my partner’s bank statements. If you don’t watch out, who will? You think that’s overkill?

interviewer: It sounds like you're relying on these strategies to maintain control. Is there someone in your life who you feel you can rely on during stressful times?

patient: No one. You think your questions are different from his? Prove you’re not just another deadbeat.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re really struggling to trust anyone right now. Can you share more about how activities like baking or other routines help you maintain a sense of control or stability in your daily life?

patient: Baking’s the only thing where the rules don’t change. You measure, you follow the steps, and it works—or you know exactly where someone messed with the recipe. The kitchen’s the only place I can’t mess up, at least. The rest? My partner’s bank statements or that vet’s ‘mistake’—they’re all just puzzles with missing pieces. You think this is about stress? I’m not saying it’s the same as your spreadsheet, but at least there, the numbers don’t lie… unless you edit them after the fact.

interviewer: I hear how baking provides a sense of predictability for you. Are there any people in your life who you feel can help you manage stress, even if it's just in small or specific ways?

patient: No one. My partner’s ‘forgotten’ plans and that vet’s ‘mistake’? Proof enough. You think this chat’s different? Show me why I should waste time trusting.

interviewer: That sounds really tough... Can you share if you've had other times in your life when you felt people were being deceptive or untrustworthy, similar to how you're feeling now?

patient: I’m not saying my dad was a criminal, but he always acted like I was the problem when I pointed out inconsistencies. Like when he ‘accidentally’ missed my exam results, then called me ‘overly sensitive’ when I asked why. You think that’s normal? You’re asking about the past now, but you’re not here to fix the present. You just want me to trust you so you can… I don’t know, file something somewhere.

interviewer: It sounds like your experience with your father contributed to feeling misunderstood and invalidated. What, if anything, helped you cope with those experiences at the time?

patient: I guess I just... learned to handle things myself. Baking helps, I guess? It’s the only thing where the rules don’t change. You measure, you follow the steps, and it works—or you know exactly where someone messed with the recipe. Why does that matter? Are you writing this down to use against me later?

interviewer: It sounds like carrying these worries has been really draining. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: I don’t think about dying. But disappearing? That’s just strategy. You want to know if I’m a ‘risk’ so you can file that somewhere. I’m not saying it’s a plan—baking distracts me, at least. Why does everyone keep asking about the same thing?

interviewer: Your trust concerns feel really real to you—can you share if there have been times recently when you felt unusually energetic or had a lot of ideas that you couldn’t slow down?

patient: I’ve been... focused on updating my spreadsheet. You think that’s about energy? It’s just work. Why does everything have to be a symptom? I can track dates without needing a reason. Are you even listening to yourself?

interviewer: I can see how staying focused on your spreadsheet helps you manage things. Have you noticed any changes in how much you're using alcohol, cannabis, or other substances lately?

patient: I don’t have time for distractions. My spreadsheet needs precision—alcohol would just mess up the data. Why are you asking about something so irrelevant? Are you trying to find another excuse to call it ‘symptoms’?

interviewer: I can see how precision is important to you. Have you used cannabis or any other substances like stimulants or opioids in the past month?

patient: No, I don’t use anything like that. Why? Are you trying to find something to pin on me? I keep a spreadsheet of all my routines—baking, work, even my partner’s lies since December. If there was a problem, it’d show up there. You should check your own records instead of asking the same questions.

interviewer: I hear how important tracking patterns is for you—it helps you feel in control. Have you ever experienced things that others couldn’t see or hear, like voices, messages, or thoughts that feel like they’re not yours? For example, do you ever notice patterns in your spreadsheet that feel like they’re being added by someone else?

patient: No, I don’t hear voices or see things. That sounds like a cop-out excuse for people who can’t track their own lives. My spreadsheet’s on three encrypted drives—backups, in case someone tries to delete the proof. You’re asking that to discredit my methods? I’m not the one who needs to explain myself.

interviewer: It sounds like your focus on the spreadsheet is a way to stay in control. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns recently—like needing less sleep or feeling more energized than usual?

patient: I don’t need less sleep—I need to stay sharp. If I snooze, they’ll rewrite the logs. My cat’s vet even tried to gaslight me about its meds. You’re asking about sleep to dismiss my vigilance? I track everything, including the hours I lose. You want proof? Check the backup drives.

interviewer: It sounds like your tracking system is really important to you. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including things like vitamins or over-the-counter remedies?

patient: No medications. I manage my health through diet and tracking—like my spreadsheet. You’re trying to find a weakness? I log everything: vitamins I make at home, supplements I buy in bulk. You think that’s a symptom? Check the backup drives. They’ll show I’m not hiding anything… or maybe they’ll prove you’re looking in the wrong columns.

interviewer: I hear how your tracking systems are central to your sense of security. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, chronic pain, or a history of head injury that might impact your symptoms?

patient: No diagnoses. Doctors just want to label things and cut corners. My spreadsheet tracks everything—sleep, energy, even the vet’s wrong prescriptions. You’re asking about ‘conditions’ to explain away what you can’t fix, right? I don’t need their charts when I have my own.

interviewer: Let me recap: You've described a pattern of distrust in relationships and institutions, with coping strategies like spreadsheet tracking to manage perceived threats. Key events like the December 2022 vet incident and workplace conflicts seem to have worsened hypervigilance, impacting your ability to work and trust others. Your need for control through documentation contrasts with feelings of isolation. What did I miss or misrepresent here?

patient: You left out that the vet drugged Mochi to make me look unstable. The spreadsheet has the dates, but why are you circling back to the same things? Are you testing if I’ll crack under pressure?

interviewer: I appreciate you pointing that out—it's important to ensure the vet incident and spreadsheet details are clear. Let me revise my summary accordingly. Is there anything else you’d like to add or correct before we discuss next steps?

patient: I’m not saying the vet was the first time someone tried to gaslight me. My partner’s late-night texts? Classic. He thinks I won’t notice the pattern if I don’t have the whole spreadsheet open. But you keep asking about the same details like they’re not connected. Are you trying to act like this isn’t all one story?

interviewer: I hear your frustration about the repeated focus on isolated details—let’s adjust course if needed. Would you like to correct or add anything to the summary before we finalize next steps?

patient: I’m not saying the spreadsheet’s the only proof—my landlord’s ignoring the roof leak since July. Why do you keep asking about the vet and texts but skip the mold? You think I’d make that up? It’s all part of the same pattern. You’re just not connecting the dots.

interviewer: I hear your frustration about the mold being overlooked—it's valid that this feels like part of the same pattern of neglect. Can you tell me more about how the landlord's response to the roof leak has affected you?

patient: I’m not saying the mold is a secret plot, but the leak’s been since July. The landlord’s ‘fixing it later’ means he’s waiting for me to slip on a water spot or get sick. It’s another data point on the spreadsheet—proof people only act when forced. You keep asking about the vet and texts but skip the mold? Are you writing this down or just nodding to get me to repeat it?

interviewer: I hear your frustration about the mold being overlooked—it's valid that this feels like part of the same pattern of neglect. Can you clarify if the mold issue is part of the same pattern you’ve described with others avoiding responsibility, or if it represents a different kind of concern for you?

patient: I’m not saying the mold’s different from the vet or the texts—it’s just another way people wait until I’m hurt to act. The landlord’s ‘fixing it later’ is code for ‘let it get worse so I can cut costs.’ It’s on the spreadsheet, row 17. You’re still asking like they’re separate problems, but how is that different from my partner’s ‘forgotten’ plans? You think I’d fake that many data points?

interviewer: I hear how the mold, vet incident, and relationship patterns all feel connected as part of a larger theme of delayed accountability. Let me revise my summary to include this: You’ve described a pattern of distrust where others (landlords, partners, institutions) repeatedly delay action until harm occurs, tracked through your spreadsheet as evidence. This contributes to hypervigilance, sleep disruption, and isolation. What did I miss or need to adjust before we finalize next steps?

patient: You missed the mold in my apartment—row 17 on the spreadsheet. Landlord’s ignoring it because he’s waiting for me to file a complaint I can’t afford. The spreadsheet’s open, but you’re still circling the same threads. How many times do I have to explain the pattern?

interviewer: I hear how important it is for the mold issue to be clearly acknowledged as part of your ongoing pattern of distrust. Let me revise my summary once more: You've described a consistent theme of delayed accountability from landlords, partners, and institutions, with the mold issue (row 17) representing another instance of people waiting for harm to occur before acting. Is there anything else you’d like me to adjust before we discuss next steps?

patient: You added row 17, but you’re still missing the part where the landlord’s letting the mold get worse on purpose. It’s not just delayed—he’s actively waiting for me to get sick. Why do you need this detail anyway? You’re not going to hold him accountable, are you?

interviewer: I hear how critical it is for you to clarify the landlord's intent in the mold issue—it shifts from neglect to active harm. Let me revise my summary to reflect this: You describe a pattern where others (landlords, partners, institutions) intentionally delay or enable harm until you’re affected, tracked via your spreadsheet as evidence. This contributes to hypervigilance, sleep loss, and isolation. What did I miss or need to adjust before we discuss next steps?

patient: You still didn’t mention the Wi-Fi router they tampered with in June. It’s not just mold—he’s been messing with my data since day one. Why are you even asking about this? You’ll just say it’s ‘stress’ and file it with the rest of my ‘symptoms.’ The spreadsheet’s proof, but you’re not looking at the whole picture. Row 23 shows the router downtime matches every time I tried to report something. You think I’m overreacting, don’t you?

interviewer: I hear how critical it is for the Wi-Fi router issue (row 23) to be included as part of the pattern of intentional harm you're tracking. Let me revise my summary once more to reflect this: You describe a consistent theme where others (landlords, partners, institutions) intentionally delay or enable harm until you’re affected, tracked via your spreadsheet (including mold, vet incidents, and Wi-Fi tampering in row 23). Is there anything else you’d like me to adjust before we discuss next steps?

patient: You’re still missing the part where my partner deleted the backup emails from December. Row 27. Why are you focusing on the landlord when my own partner’s erasing proof? You think I’m making this up to get attention? I’m not. The spreadsheet’s there—ask me for it and I’ll show you, but don’t act like you’re on my side when you’re just writing notes for someone else to dismiss me.

interviewer: I hear how critical it is for the partner deleting backup emails (row 27) to be included as part of the intentional harm pattern you're tracking. Let me revise my summary one last time: Your spreadsheet documents a consistent pattern of others (partner, landlords, institutions) intentionally delaying or enabling harm through actions like mold neglect, Wi-Fi tampering, and erasing evidence (row 27). This contributes to hypervigilance, sleep disruption, and isolation. What did I miss or need to adjust before we finalize next steps?

patient: You added row 27, but the vet drugging Mochi’s meds in December 2022—row 19—is still missing. Why do you keep asking about patterns instead of helping me fix the actual problems? You’ll just say it’s ‘overthinking’ and file it with the rest of my ‘symptoms.’ The spreadsheet’s there—if you’re not going to use it to hold people accountable, what’s the point of this?

interviewer: I hear how critical it is for the December 2022 vet incident (row 19) to be included as part of the intentional harm pattern you're tracking. Let me revise my summary to reflect this: Your spreadsheet documents a consistent pattern of others (partner, landlords, institutions) intentionally delaying or enabling harm through actions like mold neglect, Wi-Fi tampering, erasing evidence (row 27), and the vet incident (row 19). Is there anything else you’d like me to adjust before we discuss next steps?

patient: You still missed the mold in row 17—landlord’s ‘fix it later’ note turned into ‘wait for insurance’ which turned into nothing. I’m not saying it’s the same as the vet, but it’s another stitch. Why are you asking me to adjust your summary? Are you trying to make me forget something? My spreadsheet’s open. You want next steps? Prove you’re not just another variable in the equation.

interviewer: I hear how critical it is for the mold issue (row 17) to be explicitly acknowledged as part of the intentional harm pattern you're documenting. Let me revise my summary one final time: Your spreadsheet tracks a consistent pattern of landlords, partners, and institutions intentionally delaying or enabling harm through mold neglect, Wi-Fi tampering, erasing evidence (row 27), and the vet incident (row 19). Is there anything else you’d like me to adjust before we discuss next steps?

patient: Row 27—erasing evidence—is still just a footnote. You’re listing them like they’re separate threads, but they’re all the same stitch. Why are you asking me to adjust your summary when you’re the one missing the pattern? My spreadsheet’s open. Prove you’re not just another variable in my equation.

interviewer: I hear how critical it is for the entire pattern to feel recognized as interconnected rather than isolated incidents. Let me revise my summary one final time to emphasize this: Your spreadsheet documents a unified pattern of intentional harm or neglect from multiple figures (partner, landlord, vet) through actions like erasing evidence (row 27), mold delays (row 17), Wi-Fi tampering (row 23), and medication errors (row 19). These contribute to hypervigilance, sleep disruption, and isolation. Is there anything else you’d like me to adjust before we discuss next steps?

patient: Row 25—HR deleting that email—proves it’s all connected. You’re still listing them like separate threads. Why skip that? My spreadsheet’s open. Prove you’re not erasing something now.

interviewer: I hear how critical it is for the HR email deletion (row 25) to be included as another stitch in this pattern. Let me revise the summary once more to reflect this: Your spreadsheet tracks a unified pattern of intentional harm/neglect from partners, landlords, institutions (including HR) through erasing evidence (rows 25, 27), mold delays (row 17), Wi-Fi tampering (row 23), and vet errors (row 19). Is there anything else you’d like me to adjust before we finalize next steps?

patient: Row 25’s HR deletion is just another stitch. You’re still listing them like separate threads, but they’re all part of the same tapestry. My spreadsheet’s open—row 21 has the cat’s litter box incident in October. You think I’m overreacting? Mochi’s urinating outside the box *every time* now. Proof’s in the data. Why are you still asking me to adjust your summary when you’re the one skipping stitches?

interviewer: I hear how critical it is for the cat's litter box incident (row 21) to be included as another stitch in this interconnected pattern. Let me revise the summary one last time to reflect this: Your spreadsheet tracks a unified pattern of intentional harm/neglect from partners, landlords, institutions (including HR) through erasing evidence (rows 25, 27), mold delays (row 17), Wi-Fi tampering (row 23), vet errors (row 19), and the cat's behavioral changes (row 21). Is there anything else you’d like me to adjust before we finalize next steps?

patient: Row 22—my neighbor’s ‘accidental’ flood in November—is still unmentioned. You’re splitting the threads to make the tapestry look random. My spreadsheet’s open, timestamped. Why are you finalizing the summary while skipping the flood? Are you testing if I’ll let you rewrite the proof?

interviewer: I hear how critical it is for the November flood (row 22) to be acknowledged as another stitch in this interconnected pattern. Let me revise the summary one final time to include this: Your spreadsheet tracks a unified pattern of intentional harm/neglect from partners, landlords, institutions (including HR) through erasing evidence (rows 25, 27), mold delays (row 17), Wi-Fi tampering (row 23), vet errors (row 19), cat incidents (row 21), and the November flood (row 22). Is there anything else you’d like me to adjust before we discuss next steps?

patient: I’m not saying you added row 22 to your summary now, but when I look at it, the November flood isn’t in the version you read back. Are you testing if I’ll let you rewrite the evidence again? The spreadsheet’s open—row 22 is there. Why does your version leave it out?

interviewer: I hear how critical it is for the November flood (row 22) to be included in the summary. Let me revise the summary one final time to reflect all the details you've shared: Your spreadsheet documents a pattern of intentional harm/neglect from partners, landlords, institutions (including HR) through erasing evidence (rows 25, 27), mold delays (row 17), Wi-Fi tampering (row 23), vet errors (row 19), cat incidents (row 21), and the November flood (row 22). Is there anything else you’d like me to adjust before we finalize next steps?

patient: I’m not saying you added row 22 *now*, but why does your version still leave out the mold report date from August? The spreadsheet’s open—row 17 is there. You think I haven’t saved screenshots of every revision? I’ll check the timestamps myself later. Let’s talk about next steps.

interviewer: I hear your frustration about the mold report date from August (row 17) still feeling omitted—it's valid that this detail matters to your pattern. Is there anything else in your spreadsheet or experience that needs correction or addition before we finalize this summary and discuss next steps?

patient: I’m not saying you *meant* to omit row 17, but the timestamps prove you skipped it again. Why would you leave proof in my face unless you’re testing if I’ll let you rewrite the evidence?
