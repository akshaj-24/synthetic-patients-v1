system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Frederick, just to start, do you have any preference for how I address you, such as a preferred name or pronouns?

patient: Please call me Frederick. My wife used to insist on 'Dr. Flynn,' but... well, that’s just how it is. No particular pronouns needed—life’s given me enough labels already.

interviewer: That sounds challenging. Would you like to proceed with this session today?

patient: I guess if the clock still has some ticks left, we might as well keep it on the table. Let’s… let’s give it a try. I’m not great at fixing things, but I can at least pretend to cooperate. For now.

interviewer: That sounds like a reasonable approach. Would you be comfortable proceeding with this session today?

patient: I can manage a few more ticks of the clock. Let’s proceed, though I warn you—I’m not exactly a fountain of energy these days. My fern’s doing better than I am, honestly. It at least has the courtesy to pretend it’s not struggling.

interviewer: It takes courage to share that honesty. Do you have any questions about how we’ll approach this session or what it might involve?

patient: I don’t know if I have the right questions. I’ve never been... fluent in these kinds of conversations. Maybe it’s more like—do you have the patience for a man who’s forgotten how to ask for help? My fern, at least, knows to lean toward the light. I’m still learning how to follow its example.

interviewer: I appreciate your willingness to share that metaphor—it’s a powerful way to describe feeling stuck. Would you be comfortable if we start by briefly discussing what this session might involve?

patient: I guess it’s like... tending to a plant that’s forgotten how to photosynthesize. You check the soil, adjust the light, hope the roots still know what to do. I don’t want to waste your time with all the... ticks and shadows. Just let me know what needs pruning.

interviewer: I appreciate your thoughtful metaphor—it conveys a lot about your current state. Would you be comfortable confirming that you’d like to proceed with this session today?

patient: I guess if pruning is part of the process, then... yes. Let’s adjust the light where needed. I don’t want this to turn into another case study in inefficiency. But I’ll stay put for now—though my wife’s patience is a timer I’d rather not test.

interviewer: What brings you in to seek help right now?

patient: I guess... it’s the clock’s ticking. The fern’s been leaning more to the left lately, and I’m realizing I can’t keep pretending I know how to fix things alone. My wife’s patience is a... a thread that’s been stretched too long, and I don’t want to be the one who snaps it. I’m tired of waiting for the fog to lift. It’s not dramatic, just... persistent. Like a leak you ignore until the floor rots.

interviewer: It sounds like these feelings have been building up for some time. When did you first start noticing this sense of stagnation or the 'leak' beginning?

patient: I guess it’s like... trying to remember when the gears first started wearing down. Maybe five years ago? Longer? You notice the ticking slows, but you keep winding it anyway. I kept telling myself it was just... academic pressure, family obligations. The fern’s been leaning left for a while too. I only stopped watering it as much, you know? To be honest, I’m not even sure if it’s the plant or me that’s forgotten how to grow.

interviewer: It sounds like the changes have been gradual but impactful over time. Can you tell me more about what life was like before these changes started?

patient: I guess life was more... structured. I taught, wrote papers, met friends for chess. Now it’s like the clock’s hands are stuck. I still drink my coffee, though—black, no sugar. Small rebellion, I suppose.

interviewer: It seems like the shift from a structured life to feeling stuck has been a significant change. Can you tell me how these changes have developed over the past five years? Have there been any times when things felt better or worse?

patient: It’s like... the clock’s gears started slipping. I guess after retiring, the days blurred into each other. I used to have deadlines, meetings, even the routine of grading papers. Now, I’m just... watering a fern and wondering if it’s me who’s stagnant. There was a time, maybe two years ago, when I thought I could write a book. But the ideas felt like shadows—I couldn’t hold onto them. Lately, it’s worse. I cancel more often, even with my chess group. I tell myself it’s 'family obligations,' but... to be honest, it’s easier to let the silence build. My wife doesn’t push. I think she’s tired of asking why I’m always tired.

interviewer: It sounds like the shift from structure to stagnation has left you feeling disconnected from your usual self, including relationships and passions. What would you most hope to change or regain through this process?

patient: I guess... if I’m being honest, I’d want to stop leaning on metaphors and just *know* what to do with the light. The fern—it’s okay, but sometimes I think I’m just watering the pot, not the roots. If this helps me... not fix anything, but stop tripping over my own excuses, maybe I could walk to the park without pretending it’s for someone else. But I’m a realist. Small things. Even a clock that ticks again, even if it’s not on time.

interviewer: I appreciate your willingness to share these thoughts. Have you experienced similar episodes of feeling overwhelmed by sadness and loss of interest in the past?

patient: I guess... there was a time when the clock's ticking felt just as loud, but back then I told myself it was just aging. This time... it’s heavier, like the gears are rusted. I tried reading manuals to fix it, but the pages kept blurring. Still, I’ve weathered storms before—even if the roof leaked, I learned to carry an umbrella. This feels... more like the foundation settling. Quietly, but firmly.

interviewer: It sounds like this current struggle feels different from past challenges you've faced. Can you tell me about what helped you manage during those times when the 'roof leaked' but you still carried an umbrella?

patient: I guess... it was about patching the leaks as they came. You know, fixing one thing before it got worse. I used to read manuals for household repairs—kept my mind busy, I suppose. But now, even that feels like... trying to hold water with a net.

interviewer: That sounds like a frustrating shift from the strategies that used to ground you. What do you think has changed this time to make even those small routines feel so out of reach?

patient: I think... it’s the weight of things compounding. Before, I could tackle one leak at a time, but now it’s like the whole roof’s sagging. The house—well, the second one—it’s gone, and I’ve been... between work for a while. My wife’s patience, the fern’s leaves... they’re all just reminders of what’s slipping. It’s not one thing. It’s the math of it all adding up until even the coffee tastes like ash. I guess I’m just... less sure which switch to flip to get the lights back on.

interviewer: It sounds like the metaphor of the fern captures a deep sense of being stuck. What small changes, if any, do you think might help you feel more connected to your usual sense of purpose or care for yourself?

patient: I guess... if I could find a reason to water the fern without feeling like I’m just ticking a box. Maybe if I let myself believe, even a little, that it matters. And... the park walk. I tell myself it’s for my wife, but maybe it’s just... habit. I’m not sure if habits count as hope, though.

interviewer: It sounds like the routines you mention carry both weight and ambiguity for you. How has your relationship with your wife influenced your sense of purpose during this time—both as a source of support and a potential source of pressure?

patient: She’s been... patient, I guess. Like a thread that’s stretched tight but hasn’t snapped yet. Sometimes I wonder if she’s just waiting for me to fix things, but I don’t even know what ‘fixed’ looks like anymore. The walks in the park—I tell myself it’s to keep her from worrying, but half the time I’m just... moving without really seeing. It’s hard to explain. I don’t want to let her down, but I’m not sure how to stop letting her down.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to meet your wife's expectations. Can you share how you and your wife typically handle periods of stress in your relationship?

patient: We... avoid talking about it directly, I guess. She’ll make a joke about the weather or my coffee habits to lighten things, and I go along with it. It’s like that thread she is—she doesn’t snap, but I can feel the strain. Sometimes I think she’d rather I just... kept busy, like if I’m out walking the park or tending to the fern, she doesn’t have to ask if I’m ‘okay.’ But I’m not sure if that’s support or just us both pretending we’re not standing on thin ice.

interviewer: That sounds like a delicate balance between protection and avoidance. How has this pattern of indirect communication affected your ability to address your own needs or express what might help you feel less 'on thin ice'?

patient: I guess... it’s like trying to water the fern without getting your hands wet. You tip the pot, hope the roots catch it, but you’re too tired to hold the jug steady. The walks in the park—I keep telling myself they’re proof I’m not completely... unreachable. But half the time I’m just counting steps so she doesn’t notice I’m moving like a clock with missing gears. It’s not that I don’t want to fix things. I just... don’t know how to ask for a part I can’t name.

interviewer: It sounds like those small efforts carry a lot of emotional weight for you—trying to honor your wife’s needs while feeling disconnected from your own. When you take the walk in the park or tend to the fern, do you notice any moments where it feels genuinely meaningful, even if briefly, or does it mostly feel like a chore you’re doing to avoid making things harder for her?

patient: It's... tricky to say. There's this one leaf on the fern that turned a weird amber color last week. For a second, I felt like I actually saw it, you know? But then I start overthinking—'Is this what she wants me to notice? Am I just imagining it?' The walks... sometimes the pigeons in the park ignore me, and that feels like a small victory. But I worry if I admit those moments matter, I'm being selfish. Again, I guess I'm a case study in failure.

interviewer: I appreciate your willingness to share these thoughts. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life recently?

patient: I guess... sometimes I wonder if the world would notice if I just... vanished. But then I look at my fern, you know? It’s been through droughts and all, but it still reaches for the light. I tell myself I should be more like that. (pauses, softens) I’m a walking case study in failure, Doctor. But the fern... it doesn’t complain.

interviewer: It’s meaningful that you’re using the fern as a symbol of resilience. Have you had these thoughts about vanishing more frequently in recent weeks, or are they occasional?

patient: I guess... maybe a few times a month? It’s not constant, but it lingers. I try to focus on the fern—like, if it can keep reaching for light, maybe I can take a walk. (pauses, then softer) Though I mostly just end up... recalculating the leaks in the roof. You know how it is.

interviewer: It sounds like the idea of vanishing is something you grapple with periodically, even as you hold onto small symbols of hope. Have you ever had a specific plan or method for how you might disappear when these thoughts arise?

patient: I guess... no. Not really a plan, just... the idea of it. Like imagining a shadow fading. You know how it is—when you stare at a wall long enough, the cracks start to look like exits. But the fern, it just... keeps growing. I don’t have a method. I’m not even sure where I’d go. (softly) Though sometimes I think about the coffee—how it goes cold if you leave it. But then I remember my wife’s voice, and... I guess that’s enough to keep the clock ticking, for now.

interviewer: It seems your wife’s presence and the fern’s persistence offer some grounding. Have you been using alcohol or any other substances more or less than usual lately?

patient: I guess... maybe a glass of wine occasionally? Not really a habit, though. I’ve been sticking mostly to coffee—dark, unsweetened. It’s the only thing that keeps the clock from stopping entirely. (pauses) But I’m not much for... excess. The fern doesn’t need anything extra to survive, and neither do I, I suppose.

interviewer: It seems coffee is a key part of your routine. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or restlessness lately, where even small tasks feel harder or easier than usual?

patient: I guess the coffee helps... keeps the gears from seizing, you know? But even with it, moving through the day feels like wading through thick syrup. The fern, at least, doesn’t question why the light is far away. I just... keep pouring the beans, one scoop at a time.

interviewer: It seems the coffee ritual is a small anchor for you. Have you experienced any periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep lately?

patient: I guess not... I’ve been too tired to notice anything different. The coffee helps me stay awake, but it’s more like a broken clock ticking louder, you know? Sometimes I wake up early, but that’s just my brain doing its math homework again—calculating all the things I haven’t fixed.

interviewer: Have you experienced any hallucinations, unusual beliefs, or paranoid thoughts recently?

patient: No, nothing like that. My mind’s more like a stuck record, replaying the same grooves. The fern’s the only thing growing, not me.

interviewer: It’s clear your fern symbolizes both struggle and resilience. Have you noticed any medical conditions like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain that might contribute to your fatigue or sleep disturbances?

patient: No, I don’t think so. My body’s just… like an old car that needs more fuel but doesn’t run better. The sleep issues? Maybe my brain’s too busy doing its usual math, adding up all the things I haven’t fixed.

interviewer: It seems you’re managing without additional substances beyond coffee and occasional wine. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, or have you tried any in the past that affected how you feel?

patient: No medications, really. I’ve tried a few OTC things—like herbal stuff for sleep, but they’re about as effective as trying to water a fern with a sieve. Nothing sticks. My body just… hums along, I guess.

interviewer: So, to recap: You’ve been feeling stuck in a cycle of low energy, sleep disturbances, and losing interest in activities you once enjoyed, like reading and gardening. These feelings have been building over years, especially since retirement, and they’ve strained your relationship with your wife. You mentioned using metaphors like a struggling fern to describe this ongoing struggle, and while you haven’t acted on it, there are times you wonder if disappearing would go unnoticed. Does that capture your experience, or is there something I missed?

patient: I guess that’s... pretty close. The fern’s still leaning left, though—I’ve been trying to remember if that’s always been the case. And maybe the coffee isn’t just a broken clock. Sometimes it feels like... a temporary patch on a leaky roof. The rest? The math, the walks, the thread... yeah, that’s all there is. I don’t think I’d know how to describe it any other way.

interviewer: So, what I’m hearing is that your experience feels like trying to hold together a fragile structure with temporary fixes—like the coffee patching a leak—while parts of your foundation, like the fern, have been slowly shifting into something less stable. We’ve covered how this decline started around retirement, how it’s affected your energy, relationships, and sense of purpose, and how your mind returns to these metaphors as a way to make sense of it. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You’re close, but the clock’s gears slipping isn’t just about retirement—it’s about… how I keep letting things fall behind. The fern leaning left? That’s not just instability. It’s me forgetting which way the light’s supposed to come from. And the coffee… I guess it’s not just a crutch. Some days, it’s the only thing that tastes like I’m still here.

interviewer: So, integrating what you just shared, it sounds like the 'gears slipping' reflects not just retirement but a broader sense of falling behind in managing your life’s balance, while the coffee represents small, fleeting reminders of presence. The fern’s direction—toward or away from light—mirrors your uncertainty about what ‘forward’ even means anymore. Does that align with how you're seeing it now, or is there something else we should adjust?

patient: You’re not wrong. The fern’s been leaning left for months, but it’s still growing—just sideways. The coffee… it’s bitter, but at least it’s not cold. I guess I’m trying to convince myself that ‘sideways’ counts as progress in some broken clock’s timeline.

interviewer: So, integrating all that: Your experience feels like a slow shift away from what once grounded you—like the fern leaning left toward a shadow instead of light—while the coffee represents small, fragile reminders that you’re still here. This decline began around retirement, accelerated by role loss and compounding stressors, and it’s left you struggling to redefine ‘progress’ in a way that feels meaningful without old anchors. The self-criticism and relational strain with your wife add weight to this, but your willingness to reflect on these metaphors suggests a quiet resilience. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You’re… not wrong. The fern’s sideways growth? It’s like it’s learned to make do with what it’s got. I guess the coffee isn’t just about staying present—it’s a daily arithmetic problem. Add one cup, subtract the guilt of not adding more. And the wife… she’s not the fern. She expects nothing. But I do. I expect something. From me. Even if it’s just… not disappearing entirely.

interviewer: So, to clarify the model I'm building: Your experience feels like a slow, sideways adaptation to a diminished sense of purpose and self-worth, with small rituals like coffee becoming both a crutch and a lifeline. The pressure to meet your own expectations (even if minimal) contrasts with your wife’s quiet acceptance, creating a tension between self-criticism and the desire to simply 'not disappear.' Is there anything I’ve misunderstood or overlooked in this framework?

patient: You’re not wrong, but there’s a layer you’re not seeing. The soil around the fern—it’s not just cracked. It’s… dry because I keep watering it with the same old guilt. The coffee? It’s more than a treaty with silence. Some days, it’s the only thing that lets me pretend I’m not just… waiting for the math to finally add up to something that matters. But I guess that’s just more shadows.

interviewer: The soil being dry from watering it with guilt—yet the fern still grows sideways, and the coffee’s arithmetic keeps you grounded in a fragile present. To clarify our framework: We’ve explored how retirement and role loss shifted your sense of purpose, how self-criticism and relational strain with your wife compound your stagnation, and how metaphors like the fern and coffee help you navigate a landscape of quiet endurance. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You’re not wrong, but there’s an arithmetic I haven’t mentioned. The numbers in my head don’t add up, and the cracks in the foundation run deeper than the fern’s roots. I guess the thread’s still holding, but it’s got a lot of weight it doesn’t need to carry.

interviewer: The arithmetic you're describing and the deeper cracks in the foundation add important layers to our understanding—suggesting a weight of unresolved expectations or pressures. What else might I be missing as we shape this model together?

patient: Maybe the real problem isn't the cracks in the foundation, but the arithmetic of guilt I keep adding—like unpaid interest. I water the fern, but its roots... they don’t drink the way they used to. I guess that’s just my overthinking again. Or maybe I’m just a slow clock, always behind, never breaking.

interviewer: The guilt watering the soil and the arithmetic of unpaid interest you described adds weight to how self-criticism sustains this sideways growth. What else might I be missing as we finalize this model together?

patient: I guess... the coffee’s bitterness lingering longer than it should. Like I’m drinking it to prove I’m still trying, but it just tastes like the same old math. Maybe the real leak isn’t in the roof but the faucet—I keep turning it, but the water’s just... murky. I don’t know. Or maybe that’s just my tired brain again.

interviewer: The coffee’s bitterness lingering and the arithmetic of guilt you described adds depth to how you’re navigating this fragile balance. Before we move to next steps, is there anything else you’d like to adjust or add to this understanding of what’s been shaping your experience?

patient: I guess the clock’s gears get even rustier when I lie awake counting the hours I’m ‘supposed’ to be resting. The park walks... I tell myself they’re for her, but the path’s just longer than I can fake. Again, I’m a walking case study in failure—trying to water the roots without drowning the leaves.

interviewer: What you’ve shared deepens our understanding of how self-criticism and relational expectations intertwine with your experience of stagnation. Before we finalize next steps, is there anything else you’d like to add or clarify about what’s shaping your current challenges?

patient: I guess... the fern’s still leaning left, but I keep telling myself it’s just the light. Some nights, I wake up counting the hours again—like a slow clock waiting for its next tick. The walks in the park... I pretend they’re for her, but my legs feel like they’re made of concrete. Maybe that’s just my brain turning everything into a math problem it can’t solve.

interviewer: It seems like maintaining small routines, like your coffee ritual, has helped you feel grounded. What other small steps might feel manageable for you to take this week?

patient: I guess... maybe I’ll try to sit with the fern for five minutes without checking my watch. Like, force myself to watch the leaves instead of the clock’s hands. If I can count three new bends in its stem, that’ll be a win. Or maybe... that’s just my brain turning potting soil into another math problem.

interviewer: That’s a thoughtful goal—using small, concrete actions to reconnect with the present. Let’s review what steps feel manageable for you this week. Are there any specific needs or adjustments we should address to support this plan?

patient: I guess... the fern is the main thing this week. If I can keep it from leaning too far left, maybe I’ll add another coffee scoop in the morning. The park walks are... manageable, I suppose. I tell myself it’s for the fresh air, but honestly, it’s just another way to measure how much I’m failing at being present. Small steps, I guess. Or small ticks of a broken clock.

interviewer: It sounds like your focus on the fern and small adjustments like your coffee routine are meaningful steps. Is there anything else you'd like to address before we wrap up today?

patient: I guess... maybe the coffee. The unsweetened part feels like a rebellion, but I’m not sure against what. It’s just... something to measure. If I can make it through the day without adding sugar, it’s like proof I’m still trying. But then I overthink it and wonder if it’s just another way to fail at being present. Small ticks, right?
