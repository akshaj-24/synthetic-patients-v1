system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Mr. Blevins, I'm Dale McGrath. How would you prefer to be addressed?

patient: Tony is fine. Most people call me that. I guess... it’s just easier. No need for titles or anything. I’m not exactly a formal guy, you know? Though my wife still says I should ‘act my age’ sometimes.

interviewer: Thanks for letting me know how you'd like to be addressed. Would you be comfortable proceeding with this interview today?

patient: Sure, I mean... it’s not like I have a better idea. My wife kept insisting I should do this. I guess I’ll give it a shot. Just hope we don’t get stuck on the small talk. To be honest, my nerves are a bit frayed today—feels like my muscles are wired tight or something.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to carry alone. How have you been feeling overall lately, both mentally and physically?

patient: Lately, it’s like my body’s on high alert all the time. I can’t seem to relax, even when I want to. My sleep’s been… fragmented, you know? I wake up multiple times, and my head just races. It’s exhausting, but at the same time, I feel this restlessness. Like I need to keep moving or doing something, even if it’s just pacing. And the muscle tension… it’s like a constant ache in my shoulders. I guess that’s just part of the job these days.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly draining to live with daily. Before we move forward, would you like to ask any questions about how this process works or what to expect?

patient: Honestly? I’m not exactly sure what to ask. It’s not that I don’t care—it’s just… my head’s so full of all the things I should be worrying about right now. My wife says I’ll figure it out as we go. I guess I just hope we don’t circle back on the same topics forever. I’ve got a to-do list a mile long, you know?

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed and anxious. Can you tell me more about what's been most challenging for you right now?

patient: It’s like... my brain’s on a broken record, looping the same tracks. Work’s a minefield—missed a deadline last week, and now I’m second-guessing every decision I make. My father-in-law’s health isn’t helping. I try to focus, but my thoughts just... scatter. And sleep? I lie there counting the neighbor’s lawnmower passes. It’s exhausting. I should be able to handle this, but I’m not. I guess I’m just... running on fumes.

interviewer: That sounds really draining. When did you first start noticing these feelings of overwhelm and anxiety?

patient: I guess it’s been... six months? Since I took this management role and my father-in-law’s cancer diagnosis. But honestly, it feels longer. Like the anxiety was just... building, you know? I’d push through, but now even sleep won’t catch up. My neck’s always tight, and I’ve started drinking more whiskey at night—though it just leaves me guilted up worse. I should be able to handle this, but...

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot on your shoulders right now. What are you hoping to achieve through this therapy?

patient: I guess... I just want to stop being such a mess. If I’m being honest, I don’t even know what ‘fixed’ looks like, but right now I feel like I’m one missed task away from falling apart. My wife keeps saying I’m doing the best I can—those notes she leaves, it’s sweet, but it’s not enough. I need to figure out how to... not let the stress eat me alive. And maybe actually enjoy my granddaughter’s toddler chaos before I’m too tense to bend down and pick her up. But I’m not naïve—this isn’t going to be some magic cure, is it?

interviewer: That sounds really challenging... Have you experienced similar periods of anxiety or stress in the past?

patient: I’ve always been a worrier, I guess. Before this job change, it was more... manageable? Like, worrying about bills or if the kids were eating right. But this feels different. It’s like the old habits—second-guessing everything, clenching my jaw until my neck aches—but worse. My dad used to say I ‘exaggerated’ stress, so I learned to swallow it. Now... it’s not going away. Even when there’s no real reason, the tightness stays.

interviewer: It sounds like your relationship with your father shaped how you cope with stress. Can you tell me more about how your family typically handled emotional challenges growing up?

patient: It’s a bit of a stretch, but... my dad wasn’t really the type to talk about feelings. If I mentioned being stressed, he’d just say, ‘Chin up, it’s not that bad’—even when I was a kid. So I learned to... clench my jaw and keep going. Now it’s like muscle memory. I guess that’s why I hate asking for help; it feels like admitting I’m not ‘tough enough’ to handle it. But lately, even that coping’s... worn thin. My neck’s been killing me again. Oh, and my wife swears I used to collect birds as a kid to avoid talking—guess that’s another pattern I never broke.

interviewer: It sounds like collecting birds was a way to avoid difficult emotions, much like clenching your jaw now. How did that behavior help you back then, and is there anything similar you're doing now that might serve the same purpose?

patient: Birdwatching... it was just something to focus on, you know? Kept my mind off things. Now, maybe it's the lists I make, checking and rechecking work stuff. Or... a glass of whiskey when I get home. It's just... it's not really helping, but I can't stop. My neck's been killing me from clenching, though. Can't even relax when I want to.

interviewer: I want to check if there are any patterns of energy or sleep that stand out. Have you noticed times when you felt unusually energized or needed significantly less sleep, even when stressed?

patient: No, not really. It’s more like... my sleep’s been all over the map. Some nights I’m so wound up I stare at the ceiling till 2 a.m., going over client files in my head. Other nights, I pass out from exhaustion but wake up feeling like I didn’t sleep at all. The whiskey helps me *fall* asleep, I guess, but then my neck’s even tighter in the morning. It’s just... another thing I’m bad at managing.

interviewer: I hear how the whiskey brings some relief but also adds to your physical discomfort. How often do you find yourself relying on whiskey to fall asleep, and have you noticed any changes in this pattern over time?

patient: Most nights, I guess... it's become kind of a ritual. Used to just have one glass, but lately it's two, sometimes three. My wife's been giving me those notes—'You're doing the best you can'—so I try to cut back, but then I just lay there wired. Last week, I went two days without it and my neck felt like a vice. The guilt's bad too, you know? It's like I'm punishing myself for needing it.

interviewer: I appreciate how hard it is to navigate these pressures. Have you experienced any thoughts of intentionally ending your life, even if just in passing?

patient: I don’t know... I guess I’ve had moments where I wonder if disappearing would make things easier for everyone. But I don’t... I don’t see it as something I’d actually do. It’s more like a dark thought that creeps in when I’m exhausted. My neck’s been so tight lately, it’s hard to even think straight. My granddaughter laughs so much, though—it’s the only thing that feels real lately. I worry I’m too tense to be a good grandpa, but at least she still smiles when I’m around.

interviewer: I hear how the whiskey has become a part of your routine. Have you used any other substances, like cannabis or stimulants, in the past year?

patient: No, not really... I mean, whiskey’s my... my go-to. I don’t do drugs or anything like that. My wife’d kill me if I messed with weed or pills. I guess I just... stick to what I know, even if it’s making my neck a wreck. Sounds stupid, right? Like I’m some professional problem-solver who can’t fix his own head.

interviewer: Have you used any other substances besides whiskey in the past year, such as prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?

patient: Just the whiskey, I guess. It’s not like I’m popping pills or anything—though sometimes it feels like that. I mean, it’s a crutch, sure, but it’s… it’s the only thing that quietens the noise, even if just for a while. But yeah, nothing else. I’d remember if there was.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about the role whiskey plays. Have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts recently that feel concerning or out of character for you?

patient: No, nothing like that. I mean, I’m always second-guessing things at work—like double-checking files until my neck aches—but that’s just my usual... overdoing it. Not sure if that counts as paranoid. I guess if I had wild thoughts, I’d know, right? My brain’s just a worrywart, not a drama queen.

interviewer: I hear how your work habits feel familiar but overwhelming. Have you ever had periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed much less sleep, even when stressed?

patient: No, not really. I’m usually too wound up to sleep, but when I do, it’s just tossing and turning. My brain’s always on overdrive, though. I guess if I’m stressed, I might stay up late going over work stuff, but that’s just my usual... overdoing it.

interviewer: I appreciate your clarity about these patterns. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs or vitamins?

patient: No meds, really. Maybe some ibuprofen for my neck now and then, but that’s about it. I’m not into pills—just... the whiskey. I’d remember if there was anything else.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness about the physical and emotional toll this is taking. Have you been evaluated for any medical conditions that might contribute to your symptoms, such as chronic pain, thyroid issues, or sleep apnea?

patient: No, I haven’t had any specific evaluations for that. My doc just shrugs off the neck pain as ‘stress-related’ and says my blood work looks normal. I guess if there was something else, I’d know? Though... sometimes I wonder if my head’s just a broken machine. The whiskey at least numbs the cogs grinding, even if it’s not fixing anything real.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing so openly, Tony. Before we wrap up, let’s review next steps—your follow-up is scheduled for two weeks, and I’ll send some resources on managing anxiety to your email. Have we covered everything important today, or is there something else you’d like to address?

patient: I... I think that’s about it. The resources are fine, I guess. Just don’t want to end up with another ‘take a walk’ tip when my neck feels like it’s in a vice. The whiskey thing—well, it’s not like it’s helping, but it’s the only thing that *stops* the loop sometimes. And... if I could maybe mention something without sounding like a drama king? My son’s been quiet since that argument. I keep thinking I should’ve just... bent more, you know? Eased up. But it’s probably nothing. Let’s just stick to the plan.

interviewer: It sounds like the tension with your son is on your mind, even if you're trying to minimize it. How has that distance been affecting you, or have you tried to reach out since the argument?

patient: It’s... not like I can just fix it with a checklist, you know? I’ve sent a few texts, left some notes about the game he used to love—nothing dramatic. But he’s either ghosting me or giving one-word replies. I keep thinking maybe I should’ve just... backed off more, let him lead. But it’s not like I can rewind the argument. I guess I’m just stuck in this loop of wondering if I’m pushing or not pushing enough. And to be honest? The whiskey’s the only thing that stops me from staring at my phone every five minutes, waiting for a response I don’t even deserve.
