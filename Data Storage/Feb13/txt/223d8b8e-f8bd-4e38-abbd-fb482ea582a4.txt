system: Session 223d8b8e-f8bd-4e38-abbd-fb482ea582a4 transcript

system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: That sounds really challenging to manage day to day. Would you be comfortable proceeding with this session today?

patient: I guess... I mean, it’s not like I’ve got a choice, right? My mind’s been grinding like a stuck gear for months. But I’ll try. I just... I’m pretty tired, you know? Between work and everything else, but I’ll make time. For now.

interviewer: I can see how exhausting this must be for you. Do you have any questions about how this session will work before we begin?

patient: I guess not... I mean, I don’t know what to expect, but I’m here. My mind’s been like a machine that won’t shut off, but I’ll power through. Just... try not to make me think too hard, okay? I’m about three cups of coffee short of falling apart today.

interviewer: I can hear how much effort it's taking to be here right now. Would you be comfortable continuing with this session today?

patient: I guess... I mean, I’ve got to, right? My head’s been throbbing like the pipes in the plant when they’re about to burst. But I’ll power through. Just... don’t ask me anything too heavy. I’m running on fumes and three too many espressos.

interviewer: I can hear how difficult it is for you to push through right now. This session will involve discussing your thoughts and feelings to better understand what you're going through. Does that sound okay with you?

patient: Yeah... I mean, if that's what it takes. My head’s been like a machine with the wrong gears in it—just... grinding. But I’ll sit through it. Just don’t get too deep too fast. Every time I try to sort through it, my thoughts just scatter like steam. And don’t even ask me to slow down—I’m already running on empty.

interviewer: It sounds like the recent conversation with your supervisor was a turning point for seeking help. What are you hoping to address or change through this process?

patient: I guess... I just want to stop the constant spinning. It’s not like there’s one thing, right? It’s everything—the plant, the bills, my mom’s... situation. My head’s always a blur of what-ifs. If I could just focus without my mind jumping to the worst stuff, maybe I wouldn’t feel so... drained. My wife deserves more than me zoning out at the dinner table. But I don’t even know if this helps. Most days, I just want to wake up without my chest feeling like it’s wired to a power drill.

interviewer: That sounds really draining. When did you first start noticing this constant spinning and feeling overwhelmed?

patient: It’s hard to pin down exactly… maybe a year? Longer, I guess. Work started eating at me after they restructured—suddenly I was covering three shifts. My mind just… wouldn’t shut off, even when I tried to rest. I’d lie awake, replaying every decision, wondering if I’d missed something. My wife says I look like I’m ‘carrying bricks’ all the time. I just… I thought it was me being responsible. Until my mom’s diagnosis. That’s when the bricks turned to concrete.

interviewer: It sounds like this situation is really taking a toll on you. Have you experienced episodes like this before, where you felt this level of stress and overwhelm?

patient: Not exactly... I’ve had busy times, but this feels different. Like the gears are stuck in overdrive. A few years back, when the plant was downsizing, I was on edge too. But this... it’s heavier. Like concrete blocks, not just bricks. (shrugs, fingers tapping knee) I guess I just thought it was part of the job? Or getting older. My wife says I used to laugh more. Now I just... count steps to make sure I didn’t miss anything. (pauses, rubs neck) Is this normal, doc? Or am I just... breaking down slowly?

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. Have you experienced other times in your life where you felt this kind of overwhelming pressure, and if so, what helped you cope back then?

patient: I guess... when the plant downsized a few years back, I just kept myself busy. Stayed late, took on extra shifts. Thought if I focused on work, the rest would... catch up. But this time, it’s different. Even when I’m home, my head’s still at the plant. I used to fall asleep to the TV noise, but now I just lie there, my neck stiff like I’ve been carrying those bricks all day. (rubs neck) My wife says I used to laugh more. Now I’m just... trying to keep the gears from seizing up. Doesn’t really help, though, does it?

interviewer: It sounds like your wife has noticed changes in you that concern you both. How has she been supporting you through this stress, or what has she suggested to help ease the tension at home?

patient: She tries... I guess. She makes sure I eat, you know? Brings me lunch at work sometimes. But lately, it’s like... she’ll sit down to talk, and I just get this knot in my neck. I end up scrolling through bills or checking my phone. I tell her it’s just efficiency, but... (rubs neck) She keeps saying I need to rest more, that I’m too hard on myself. Maybe she’s right. But how can I rest when the plant’s running on fumes and my mom’s... (voice trails) I hate that she’s worrying about me too. She’s got her own pain to deal with, and I’m just... adding to it.

interviewer: That sounds really tough, feeling like you're adding to your wife's stress. When you stayed busy during the plant downsizing, did that approach help manage your stress at that time, or did it end up adding to your burden?

patient: I... I guess staying busy felt like it kept the gears moving, you know? After the plant cut back, I just kept working late, double-checking everything. But the more I did, the more I felt like... like the machine’s grinding itself into parts. My shoulders are always knots by morning. It didn’t really help, but I couldn’t stop. Still can’t. My wife says I’m overdoing it, but how else am I supposed to make sure everything lines up?

interviewer: Have you ever had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life?

patient: I... I don’t think about that. Not really. It’s not like I want to disappear or anything. My wife needs me to be here, even if I’m... broken. Sometimes I just wish the worrying would stop, you know? But I guess that’s not the same. My mom’s condition, it’s just another thing that won’t let up. I’m tired, but I keep going. Everyone’s tired, right?

interviewer: It sounds like the weight you're carrying feels almost physical at times. How have you been sleeping lately? Do you find yourself needing more or less sleep than usual?

patient: Sleep? It’s... it’s like the off switch’s broken. I lie there counting the minutes, but my head’s still running the shift. I guess I sleep less now—three, four hours if I’m lucky—but when I do, it’s like the bed’s got gears under it. I wake up stiff, chest tight, and my hands... they shake a little. My wife says it’s stress, and she’s not wrong. But when you’re trying to make sure the pipes don’t freeze or the bills get paid, how do you just... turn it off? I guess my body’s learned to run on empty. It’s just... another thing that won’t line up.

interviewer: I want to make sure I understand how you’re coping with all this stress. Have you started using alcohol or other substances to help you sleep or manage your energy at work?

patient: I... I guess there’s wine at family gatherings sometimes. Nothing heavy, just... a glass to loosen up the tongue, you know? My wife doesn’t mind. But I don’t need it to function. I just... I watch that cop show I mentioned, and it helps the edges blur a little. Not that I’m avoiding anything. Just... managing. I don’t want to add to her worries, so I keep it small. Really, it’s just the TV and the wine. Nothing worse.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing how you manage stress. Have you been using any other substances, like cannabis or medications, to help with stress or sleep?

patient: No, nothing like that. Just the wine sometimes, you know? Helps the edges blur a bit. My wife doesn’t mind. I guess it’s just... part of the routine. Like checking the pressure gauges—make sure nothing’s leaking, you know?

interviewer: Have you experienced any periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed significantly less sleep than usual, even when you were stressed or overwhelmed?

patient: No, I’ve been the opposite—like a machine that’s always running, can’t shut off. Even when I try to power down, my head’s still cycling through lists, checks... stuff that needs fixing. Sleep? More like... short circuits. Wake up stiff, chest tight. The wine helps me *feel* like I’m shutting down, but the next day? I’m still running on empty. My shoulders... they’re always clenched like I’m holding back a flood. Irritable? Yeah. But isn’t that normal when you’re... I don’t know, running low on fuel?

interviewer: It sounds like the physical and mental strain is taking a real toll. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices or seeing things that others don’t?

patient: No, I don’t hear voices or see things—just… my own head won’t quiet down. It’s like a stuck radio, always static. I guess I get distracted sometimes? Like, I’ll be in the middle of something and my mind jumps to… whatever’s broken next. My wife says I’m ‘zoning out,’ but it’s more like my thoughts are on loop. The chest thing? That’s real, though. Feels like a vice sometimes. But it’s work, right? The pressure… it’s getting to everyone.

interviewer: Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins, and if so, how have they been working for you?

patient: No, I’m not on any meds—just... ibuprofen for the knots in my shoulders. And maybe some B-complex vitamins. Doesn’t really help, though. The wine helps me *feel* like I’m shutting down, but...

interviewer: It sounds like the wine helps you manage the tension at the end of the day. How often do you have wine, and how much do you typically consume in a sitting?

patient: A couple of glasses, I guess? Three or four times a week. Mostly after work—helps me... unwind, you know? My wife says I should cut back, but it’s not like I’m blacking out or anything. Just... enough to mute the static in my head. Though the chest thing still lingers. Feels like a vice, even after. Shoulders? Always knotted. I guess it’s just part of the job, right? Powering through.

interviewer: I see. Have you been using any other substances besides wine, such as cannabis, prescription medications, or stimulants, to manage stress or sleep?

patient: No, just the wine. I guess... maybe some B-complex vitamins? Doesn’t really help, though. The chest thing’s still there. I don’t want to add more stuff—my doc says it’s not a big deal, just stress. So I figure, if I power through, maybe it’ll pass. You know?

interviewer: It sounds like the chest tightness is a significant physical symptom for you. Have you been evaluated for any other medical conditions, such as thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain, that might be contributing to your symptoms?

patient: I had a check-up last year—blood work, EKG, all that. Doc said it was 'stress-related' and prescribed a vitamin regimen. I guess I tried to explain the chest tightness, but he just adjusted my blood pressure meds. The knots in my shoulders? Yeah, the massage therapist says it’s tension from… you know, grinding through shifts. The wine helps maybe 10%? But I can’t exactly clock out early to lie around, right?

interviewer: From what you've shared, it sounds like the past year has brought a lot of stress from work changes, caring for your mother, and financial worries, leading to constant mental strain, physical tension, and difficulty resting. Your wife has noticed how this is affecting your mood and connection, but you're trying to keep going despite feeling overwhelmed. What did I miss?

patient: I guess you didn’t miss the part where my mom’s memory’s fading, but… it’s like trying to hold water in your hands. The doc just says 'manage stress,' but how do you manage when you’re juggling three jobs and wondering if your wife’s back pain means you’re failing her too? The wine only blurs it, and even the garden’s not growing fast enough to keep up with the cracks. I just… I don’t know how much longer I can keep checking the same settings on the machines before something breaks for real.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight you're carrying feels almost physical now, like a machine grinding past its limits. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... the part where you can’t even tell where the machine ends and the person begins? My chest still feels like it’s caving in, but I keep going for my wife. The wine only blurs the edges, and even then... I’m just waiting for something to snap. The garden’s not even growing zucchini anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like the physical strain and emotional weight you're carrying feel almost unbearable at times, and the garden's decline might mirror how you're seeing your own resilience. Is there anything else I should know before we talk about next steps?

patient: I guess… the part where I’m scared I’m not noticing things with my wife’s back? Like, what if I miss something because I’m too tired? The wine doesn’t even numb that worry anymore. The garden’s soil’s turning to dust, but I keep watering it harder, thinking maybe… maybe that’s all it takes. I don’t know. The machine’s running on fumes, but I can’t let it stall.
