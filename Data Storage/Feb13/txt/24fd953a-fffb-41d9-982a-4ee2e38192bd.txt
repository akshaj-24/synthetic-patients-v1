system: Session 24fd953a-fffb-41d9-982a-4ee2e38192bd transcript

system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Charles. How would you like to be addressed today?

patient: Mr. Williams is fine. Just... Charles if you prefer, but I guess 'Mr. Williams' sounds more professional. Helps keep things... clear, you know? (Adjusts collar slightly, avoiding eye contact.)

interviewer: Charles, I appreciate you sharing that. Would you be comfortable proceeding with our discussion today?

patient: Sure, if you need me to. Just... keep it concise, right? My shift starts early, but I can spare the time. (Fidgets with a pen on the table.) I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like you're balancing a lot right now. Can you confirm that the goal of today's session is to explore what's been on your mind and discuss ways to support you?

patient: Yeah, that sounds... reasonable. I mean, I’ve just been dealing with a lot of stuff piling up. Work’s been tight, and you know, family stuff. It’s just... hard to keep up sometimes. (Fidgets with the pen, avoiding eye contact.) But I’ll manage. I always do.

interviewer: It sounds like managing all these pressures is really challenging. Before we move forward, do you have any questions about how today’s session will work or anything else?

patient: No, I think we’re good. Just... trying to keep up with everything. (Fidgets with the pen, then stills it abruptly.) You know how it is. Work’s got this... urgency, and home’s got its own mess. I’ll figure it out. Always do.

interviewer: It sounds like these stressors have been building up, making it hard to cope. When did these feelings of being overwhelmed and on edge start, and was there a specific event or change that made things feel more unmanageable recently?

patient: It’s been... six months? Maybe? I guess the missed deadline at work and that fight with my partner over the anniversary kinda... cracked the glass, you know? But it’s not just that. Every day feels like juggling rusty wrenches. My shoulders are always like a car battery’s weight, and I lie awake counting ceiling tiles. I tell myself it’s just ‘being responsible,’ but... last week I snapped at a coworker over a wrench size. Then felt awful. It’s not a manual for adulting, is it?

interviewer: That sounds really frustrating, and it's clear it left you feeling upset afterward. When you snapped at your coworker over the wrench size, what were you feeling in that moment, and how did you feel afterward?

patient: I was... my hands were already shaking from not sleeping, right? Like the wrench was ice water in my grip. I just saw the wrong size and my head went, 'Mistake! Mistake!' so I barked at him. After? My chest felt like a car battery—too much current but nowhere to plug in. I kept replaying it, wondering if he thinks I'm a lunatic. But it's not about him. It's... what if I blow everything at work? What if she hears about it? I tell myself it's just stress, but the stress has a mind of its own now.

interviewer: It sounds like that moment at work really amplified your worries about losing control. When did these feelings of being overwhelmed and on edge first start to feel unmanageable, and was there a specific event or change that made things feel more urgent recently?

patient: It’s not like there’s a ‘breaking point’—it’s more like... the machine just starts making more noise until you can’t hear anything else. The deadline and anniversary thing was the first bolt coming loose, but lately, it’s my partner’s new job. She’s doing better financially, which is good, but I keep thinking, ‘What if I’m not enough anymore?’ My shoulders feel like they’re holding up a shelf with no brackets. And I dream about my ficus plant dying, but I wake up and it’s still there, just... sad. I told her I’m ‘adjusting,’ but I don’t even know what that means. It’s not a crash, it’s just... static.

interviewer: It sounds like the ficus plant is a powerful symbol for how you're feeling about your current situation. What does the plant's condition mean to you in your dreams, and how does it relate to what you're experiencing now?

patient: The plant in my dreams... it’s wilting, you know? All the leaves are yellowing, but when I wake up, it’s just... sad. Still there, though. Kinda like me. I keep thinking it’s gonna die, but it’s holding on. Maybe that’s what I’m doing—just holding on. But what if one day it’s not enough? I water it every three days, but what if I forget? What if I mess it up like everything else? It’s stupid, right? Plants don’t need me. Neither does anyone else, probably.

interviewer: It sounds like this has been a challenging few months. Have you experienced periods like this before, where you felt overwhelmed with stress and anxiety?

patient: I’ve always been a worrier, you know? Even as a kid, I’d stress over homework until it was ‘perfect.’ But this... this feels like the first time I can’t just power through. My shoulders used to hurt from carrying worries; now they feel like they’re holding up a shelf with no brackets. And the sleep? I used to lie awake counting ceiling tiles. Now I count them and still can’t tell if I’m breathing right. It’s... louder now. Like the static’s turned up.

interviewer: It’s clear how this feels different from past worries. Have you experienced similar periods of overwhelming anxiety before, and if so, what helped you manage it at the time?

patient: I’ve had my share of stress, sure. Back when the factory was slower, I’d just… work longer hours to keep my head down. Helps, I guess? Though it’s like putting a bandaid on a leaky pipe. My partner says I need to ‘unwind,’ but how do you unwind when your brain’s on a production line? I’ve tried drinking more, but that just makes the numbers blur. Wait—did I mention the ficus? It’s still alive, which is more than I can say for my sleep. Maybe that’s it? Keeping things… orderly. Even if it’s just the plant.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot on your shoulders right now. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: No—no, I haven’t. That’s not me. I mean, I’m… I’m not suicidal. Just… stuck in this loop of ‘fix it, fix it, fix it.’ Like my brain’s a broken radio playing static. But I guess I’d cross that line if I ever stopped trying. Which I don’t. Not really. I just… tighten every bolt until my hands hurt. Maybe that’s my way of saying I’m okay? My partner says I’m dramatic. Maybe she’s right.

interviewer: I hear how much effort you're putting into holding things together, even when it's physically and emotionally taxing. Have you noticed any changes in how you're using alcohol or other substances lately to cope with this pressure?

patient: I—I guess I’ve had a few more drinks lately. Not like… excessive, just enough to quiet the noise. My partner says I’m drinking to numb the static. Maybe she’s right. But it’s not like I’m some weekend souse. I still show up for work, right? Though lately, the numbers blur longer. I tell myself it’s just… social. But my hands shake worse now. Like an old engine that can’t idle smooth.

interviewer: It sounds like the drinking has become a way to cope, but it's also causing some physical effects. How often have you been drinking, and about how much each time?

patient: It’s… maybe two or three times a week? Not every night, just enough to keep the engine running smooth. Three, maybe four drinks each time? My partner jokes I need a shot glass measuring tape. But it’s not like I’m blacking out—just… the numbers blur longer. My hands shake worse now, though. Feels like the coffee jitters and the whiskey both fighting for space. I tell myself it’s just… maintenance.

interviewer: I hear how the alcohol use is becoming a part of your routine to manage the static, even as it starts to affect your body more. Have you been using any other substances like cannabis, stimulants, or opioids to cope with stress or anxiety?

patient: No—just the whiskey. I’m not some… weekend souse. It’s the only thing that slows the static down, even if it’s not working as well as before. My hands still shake, but at least the numbers don’t blur all the time. Not like I’d touch anything else. Machines don’t run on magic, right?

interviewer: I hear how the whiskey has become a way to manage the static, even as it introduces new physical challenges. Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or over-the-counter drugs for stress, anxiety, or any other concerns?

patient: No meds, just... whiskey. My doctor says it's not exactly a vitamin, but it's the only thing that slows down the static long enough to sleep. Though now my hands shake even when I'm not holding a glass. Irony's a cheap thrill, I guess.

interviewer: I hear how the physical effects of the alcohol are becoming more noticeable for you. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns lately, like feeling unusually restless or needing less sleep than usual?

patient: I’m always tired, but it’s not like I can afford to sleep. Some nights I just... lie there, you know? My brain won’t shut off. Other nights I wake up so jumpy I swear I heard a fire alarm. Coffee’s my morning thing now—three cups before my hands even steady. But it’s not like I’ve got time to waste, right?

interviewer: I hear how the static feels louder now, even as you push through the exhaustion. Have you noticed any times lately where you felt unusually restless, had a lot of energy, or took risks you wouldn’t normally take—maybe even when you were sleep-deprived?

patient: Restless? Always. But it’s not like I’m out there… you know, doing something stupid. Just… keep grinding, right? Some nights I’ll stay at work till closing, tell myself I’m being ‘responsible.’ Even when my head’s foggy, I figure better to over-prepare than risk a mistake. My supervisor said something about ‘burnout’ once. I told him I’m just built for overtime.

interviewer: I hear how the pressure to push through is taking a toll on your body and mind. Have you noticed any periods lately where you felt unusually energetic or had a lot of energy, even when you were sleep-deprived?

patient: Energy? Not really. Just... this constant buzz. Like my head's on a loop. Some nights I'm so wired I can't sleep, so I stay at work. Not because I've got energy, just... can't stop. My hands still shake, but coffee keeps me going. Supervisor says I'm overworking, but what's the alternative? Let things fall apart?
