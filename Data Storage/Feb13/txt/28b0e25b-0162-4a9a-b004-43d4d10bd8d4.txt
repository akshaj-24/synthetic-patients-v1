system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Hello, Ms. Turner. Thank you for coming in today. To start, would you like to share your preferred name or pronouns, or are you comfortable with me using Jody?

patient: Yeah, Jody's fine. I'm not really one for complicating things, you know? Just call me Jody.

interviewer: Would you like me to explain the purpose of today's session and how it will go?

patient: Um, I guess... I just want to get through this without wasting anyone's time. Is this like the standard check-up stuff? I had a rough night, my hands are still a little shaky, but I'm here, aren't I?

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling quite overwhelmed right now. Would you be comfortable continuing with the session as we discussed?

patient: I guess so... it’s just, my hands are still shaking something awful. Can we maybe get through this without too much... you know, going in circles? I had a rough night, but I’m here, aren’t I?

interviewer: That sounds really tough. Just to make sure we’re aligned, today’s session will involve discussing your current concerns and how we can support you. Does that sound okay?

patient: I guess that’s... fine. Just don’t mind the shaking, it’s this stupid coffee I drank to stay awake. Honestly, it’s all the same stuff—money, the kids, that cough I keep putting off. But let’s get through this, yeah? My grandson’s birthday is next week, at least that’s something to focus on.

interviewer: That’s a good goal to have. Before we move forward, do you have any questions about what we’ll be discussing today or how the process works?

patient: No, I guess not... unless there’s something specific you need from me. I just hope we don’t end up circling the same old stuff again, you know? My hands are still shaking from that coffee, but I’ll power through. It’s just... been a long few months.

interviewer: Can you tell me more about the main concerns that have been on your mind lately?

patient: Ugh... it’s the usual, I guess. The cough’s been driving me nuts—probably just allergies or something, but it’s keeping me up at night. And then there’s the rent increase, the dog next door that won’t stop barking... it all just adds up. My son’s in over his head with student loans, and my daughter’s been so quiet since her breakup. I tell myself it’s normal stuff, but half the time I can’t even focus on baking cookies without second-guessing every step. It’s like my brain’s on loop, you know?

interviewer: That sounds really frustrating and exhausting. Can you tell me when you first started feeling this overwhelmed and how long these stressors have been affecting you?

patient: It's been... hard to pinpoint exactly when it all started, but I guess the divorce two years ago really tilted things. Before that, I was busy trying to keep everything together for the kids, you know? Now it's like the weight just... settled. The cough's been going on since last winter, and the rent increase hit around the same time. I can't even bake without my hands shaking, and sleep? Ugh, I count sheep till 3 a.m. then lie there replaying every stupid bill I haven't paid. It's just... normal adult stuff, right? Everyone's stressed about money and their kids these days.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry alone. What are you hoping to achieve by coming in for support now?

patient: I guess... I want to figure out how to stop letting all this stuff eat at me. You know, like actually sleep without counting every missed bill. My hands still shake when I try to make cookies for little Ethan’s birthday, and I don’t want to mess up that for him. But I’m not sure if that’s even what this is for—I just keep thinking there’s something I’m supposed to fix here.

interviewer: It sounds important that Ethan’s birthday is a priority for you, even as everything feels overwhelming. How long have you noticed your hands shaking when you try to do things like bake or handle small objects?

patient: It’s been about two years, I suppose—since the divorce really knocked me off balance. At first, it was just my hands trembling when I’d try to measure flour or anything precise. Now it’s worse. I’ll reach for a spoon and my fingers slip, so I just use a bigger utensil and tell myself it’s ‘getting older’ or ‘too much caffeine.’ But lately, even that feels like a chore. It’s not like I can just... stop them from shaking, you know? It’s there, constant, like another voice in my head I can’t shut off.

interviewer: It sounds like this has been a long and challenging journey for you. Have you experienced similar episodes of overwhelm and anxiety in the past, and if so, what helped you manage them?

patient: I guess you could say I’ve always been a nervous type, but it’s gotten... worse, I guess? After the divorce, money stuff, the kids’ problems—it just stacks up. I try to handle it by, y’know, making lists, doing the crossword every day. Black tea helps, maybe? Keeps my hands steady enough. But honestly, most days I just feel like I’m one missed payment away from falling apart. My grandson’s birthday next week is the only thing that’s kept me from... I don’t know, disappearing into the couch. But I’m probably just being dramatic. Again.

interviewer: It sounds like your grandson’s birthday gives you a sense of purpose during tough times. Who do you usually turn to when things feel overwhelming, or is there someone who has helped you in the past?

patient: I don’t usually... bother anyone, you know? I mean, who’s got time for that? My sister’s got her own messes, and I don’t want to be the drama queen in someone else’s story. But Ethan—my grandson—he’s the one thing that keeps me from... from letting the whole pile of crap just crush me. I guess I’ll call his mom once in a while to double-check the birthday plans, but even that feels like a burden. Most days, it’s just me, the tea, and these damn shaky hands. I’m probably overthinking it all, though. Kids’ birthdays are probably not that big a deal in the grand scheme of things.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying a lot of stress and worry lately. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life recently?

patient: I don’t think about... you know, stuff like that. Not really. I mean, some days I feel like I’m just... dragging myself through the motions. But Ethan’s birthday is in a week, and I can’t let him down. That’s probably why I’m still here, honestly. But I’m sure you’ve heard worse stories. Probably just stress, you know?

interviewer: It’s clear Ethan’s birthday is a meaningful goal for you. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or restless, even with little sleep?

patient: I don’t know... I guess when I can’t sleep, I just end up pacing the apartment, checking the mail, re-doing the same crossword puzzle over... you know, stuff like that. My hands still shake bad enough I spill half the tea I’m trying to drink. But it’s probably just me being a nervous wreck over Ethan’s birthday. Who cares if I look a little... frayed? As long as the cookies don’t crumble, right?

interviewer: It sounds like you're really trying to stay on top of things despite feeling overwhelmed. Have you been drinking alcohol more or less than usual lately, or using any other substances like cannabis or prescription medications?

patient: Nope, not really. I don’t drink much—maybe a glass of wine once in a blue moon, but mostly just tea. Black tea, lots of it. Helps with the nerves, I guess? Though even the tea’s been shaking out of my hands more lately. But Ethan’s birthday’s in a week, so I’ve been trying to stay... focused. You know how it is.

interviewer: Thanks for sharing that. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including things like vitamins or over-the-counter remedies, to manage your symptoms or other health concerns?

patient: No, I don’t take anything—meds or supplements. Not since the divorce, anyway. I used to have a prescription for sleep once, but that didn’t work. Now it’s just… tea. Black tea. A lot of it. Helps me focus, I guess. Though half the time I’m too shaky to hold the cup straight. Ethan’s birthday baking’s the only thing keeping me from forgetting how to hold anything at all.

interviewer: It sounds like the restlessness you're experiencing is quite challenging. Have you noticed any times when you feel like you need less sleep or have more energy than usual during these restless periods?

patient: No, it’s the opposite. I can’t seem to rest even when I’m exhausted. The tea keeps me awake sometimes, but when I finally do lie down… my mind’s just a hamster wheel. Worrying about Ethan’s birthday supplies, or if the rent’s going up again. My hands shake worse when I can’t sleep—like they’re trying to take over the whole arm. You’d think if I just checked the mail one more time, something would fix itself, but it never does.

interviewer: It sounds like your worries are really affecting your physical comfort. Have you noticed any experiences where you hear voices, see things others don’t, or have strong beliefs that others might find unusual or paranoid?

patient: No, I don’t hear voices or see things. But… sometimes I catch myself thinking my ex might be saying bad things to the kids about me. Not that it makes sense, right? I mean, there’s no proof. It’s just… static in my head, same as everything else. My hands start shaking again when I dwell on it, so I focus on Ethan’s birthday stuff. Keeps me from spiraling, even if it’s just cookies and wrapping paper.

interviewer: It sounds like those thoughts about your ex can be really unsettling for you. Have you noticed any other experiences where you feel like people are talking about you or acting in ways that seem suspicious, even if it doesn't make sense?

patient: I guess you could say... sometimes I catch people looking at me in the grocery store. Like the other day, this woman at the bakery aisle kept staring. My first thought was, 'She’s judging me for being alone,' but that’s probably just me being dramatic. My hands got all shaky again, so I hurried to check Ethan’s cupcake order. It’s just... static, I know. But the shaking? That’s real.

interviewer: That must be distressing to feel so self-conscious in public. Have you noticed any medical issues that might be contributing to your symptoms, such as thyroid problems or chronic pain?

patient: Honestly? I’ve been putting off the doctor about this cough—it’s been months, but I tell myself it’s just allergies or age. My hands still shake when I try to do anything precise, like wrapping Ethan’s gifts. The fatigue? That’s just… life, right? You know how it is. At least baking for the birthday gives me something solid to focus on. Keeps me from… overthinking.

interviewer: Jody, from what we’ve discussed, it sounds like your anxiety and physical symptoms—like the tremors and sleep issues—have been building for years, especially since the divorce, and they’re now making it hard to manage daily tasks and care for yourself. The stress of finances, family worries, and your cough are adding to that pressure, but your focus on Ethan’s birthday shows there’s still something you’re holding onto. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: I guess you didn’t mention how my dad’s joblessness taught me to panic over every late bill, you know? And the cough… it’s been there for months, but I keep telling myself it’s ‘just my age.’ As for Ethan’s cookies… my hands shake so bad when I try to frost them, I’m half-convinced I’ll end up with a plate of abstract art. But fine, maybe the doctor appointment isn’t *totally* avoidable anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like your father’s experiences with joblessness have shaped how you handle financial stress, and the cough and hand tremors are adding to your daily challenges. What else have we missed that’s important to include?

patient: I guess there’s... I don’t know, this thing with my ex? He’s probably just being dramatic, but I can’t stop thinking he’s badmouthing me to the kids. And that stupid dog next door—howl every time I try to watch *Golden Girls* or bake in peace. Ethan’s cookies are the only thing that makes me feel like I’m doing *something* right, but now even that feels like a chore. Sorry, this is probably too much.

interviewer: It sounds like your concerns about your ex's behavior and the neighbor's dog are adding to your stress, and that Ethan’s cookies, once a comfort, now feel like a burden. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: I guess... the cough’s been there so long I just write it off as ‘old lady lungs,’ but it’s been months. And the ex? I know it’s probably nothing, but what if he’s really making me out to be some monster to the kids? And that dog? Howl every time I try to make those cookies without crying. My hands shake so bad now, I’m scared I’ll ruin Ethan’s birthday. Sorry, I’m just... too much, aren’t I?

interviewer: It sounds like your physical symptoms, family stressors, and financial worries are interconnected, and your efforts to prepare for Ethan’s birthday show your strength. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: I guess... you didn’t mention how I feel like I’ve lost my purpose since I quit working. I used to have a routine, now I’m just... waiting for the bills to come or for something to go wrong. And baking? I used to love it, but now I’m scared I’ll burn the cookies and ruin Ethan’s day. It’s stupid, right? Probably just more stress.

interviewer: It sounds like losing your purpose and the pressure around Ethan’s cookies are really weighing on you. Before we plan next steps, is there anything else I’ve missed that’s important to include?

patient: I guess... there’s the thing about my hands. They’re not just shaking when I’m baking—they do it when I’m trying to write a check, or hold my phone. It’s like my body’s decided I’m not trustworthy with anything. And I don’t even know if the doctor’ll help, but maybe if I go... maybe I’ll feel like I’m doing something instead of just waiting for the worst.

interviewer: It’s clear how important Ethan’s birthday is to you. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or clarify about next steps?

patient: I guess... the doctor’s appointment I’ve been putting off. It’s probably just stress, but this cough won’t go away. And my hands still shake when I’m trying to do something simple, like frost cookies for Ethan. I don’t know if it’s anything to worry about, though. Maybe I’m just overthinking, as usual.

interviewer: It sounds like scheduling that doctor’s appointment could help ease some of this uncertainty. Would you be open to discussing how we might support that next step, or is there anything else about Ethan’s birthday plans you’d like to address before we wrap up?

patient: Honestly? I’m not sure what else there is to say about the doctor. It’s just... a cough, right? Probably nothing. I mean, my hands still shake when I try to frost those cookies for Ethan, but I’ll figure it out. Black tea helps a little. Anyway—Ethan’s birthday is next week. I want to make sure the cupcakes don’t end up on the floor this time. That’s... that’s the important thing.

interviewer: It’s clear how meaningful Ethan’s birthday is to you. How would you feel about scheduling that doctor’s appointment to address the cough and hand tremors, so you can feel more confident and comfortable baking the cupcakes?

patient: I... I guess I could call them. But it’s not like I’m getting any younger, right? Black tea’s been my only ‘medicine’ lately, but if it’ll help me stop shaking when I frost those cupcakes for Ethan, sure. Just don’t want to waste time if it’s nothing. You know how it is. But the kid’s birthday’s next week—I can’t let him see me mess up the cookies again. That’s the least I can do.

interviewer: It’s clear how much Ethan means to you, and I admire your commitment to making his birthday special. Before we finish, would you like to share any final thoughts or questions, or shall we wrap up with the next steps we discussed?

patient: I guess that’s it, really. I’ll call the doctor... if the tea doesn’t ‘fix’ it by then. Just... don’t want Ethan to see me fumbling the cupcakes again. Black tea’s my only trick left, but if I can frost one batch without spilling, maybe the rest will follow. Let’s... let’s wrap it up. I’ve got a list of colors to pick for his balloons. Can’t have him thinking Grandma’s still ‘on edge,’ right?
