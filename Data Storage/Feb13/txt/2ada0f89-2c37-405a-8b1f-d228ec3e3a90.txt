system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Wanda. It sounds like coming to terms with needing help is a big step. Would you prefer to be called Wanda, and are there any pronouns you'd like me to use?

patient: Yes, Wanda is fine. She/her, I guess. Doesn’t really matter—probably overthinking it. Just… keep it simple, like everyone else. I mean, I’m the therapist who needs therapy, so… might as well stick to basics. Saves time for the actual clients, right?

interviewer: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed by all this. Would you like me to explain a bit more about how these sessions usually work and what to expect?

patient: Well, as a therapist, I know it's supposed to be about... talking, but I always wondered if there's a manual I'm supposed to follow. I guess I just assume it's more about... fixing things efficiently. I mean, I don't want to waste time, you know? But honestly, lately, even showing up on time feels like a victory. Some days, I just... move through molasses. You ever had that?

interviewer: It sounds like coming to therapy feels both familiar and frustrating right now. Would you be comfortable if we start by exploring what's been most challenging for you, and adjust as we go?

patient: I… guess that makes sense. The hardest part is probably the… the stuff at work. Forgetting clients’ names, second-guessing diagnoses—it’s like my brain’s on a loop. I tell myself it’s just… neurotransmitters or stress, you know? But then I stay up late, thinking I should be fixing this, and I’m just… moving through molasses by morning. Does that sound ridiculous?

interviewer: It sounds like work-related challenges are adding to your sense of being stuck... Would you like to ask any questions about how we might approach these sessions before we continue?

patient: Do you have a... a framework in mind? I guess I’m used to structure. But honestly, I’m probably overcomplicating it. Some days, even following a basic plan feels like wading through molasses. You ever get stuck in that?

interviewer: Sure, I usually work collaboratively, adjusting as needed. Would you like to ask anything else before we continue?

patient: I guess the main thing is just... feeling stuck. Like I said before, it's like moving through molasses. Even simple tasks take forever, and I'm exhausted. Work's been... tricky. Forgetting things, second-guessing everything. It's hard to tell if it's just stress or something more. Maybe we could... focus on practical steps? If that makes sense.

interviewer: It sounds like practical steps feel important to you right now. Would you be comfortable proceeding with this approach?

patient: I guess... if we can break it down into something tangible, that might help. But I have a feeling I’ll just overcomplicate it all anyway. Like, what if the ‘steps’ are just another thing I end up second-guessing? Still, it’s probably better than just... sitting here spinning in molasses. Although I might need a really strong coffee to even attempt it. My usual triple shot’s been more of a crutch lately, but at least it keeps me from sleeping until 3 a.m. again.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy emotional load lately... Can you tell me more about what’s been most challenging for you right now?

patient: The hardest part is... the mental fog. Like my brain’s stuck in neutral, but I’m forced to keep shifting gears anyway. At work, I’ll forget a client’s name mid-session or second-guess a diagnosis I know is sound—it’s not just stress, it’s like my confidence’s been short-circuited. And then there’s the coffee. I drink so much that it’s a miracle I don’t shake apart, but without it, I’d just lie awake replaying every mistake. It’s... managing the ‘functional’ version of myself while the other one... hums underneath. I guess therapists aren’t supposed to need this many crutches.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry... When did you first notice this mental fog and these challenges starting to affect your work and daily life?

patient: I think it started... maybe a year ago? It crept in slowly, like rust on metal. At first, I blamed long hours or the divorce settling, but then the forgetting—clients’ names, basic notes—became... persistent. I’d stay late to ‘catch up,’ but my brain just felt like static. The coffee? That started as a joke, but now it’s this... ritual. If I don’t down three shots by noon, I’m just waiting for 3 a.m. to stare at the ceiling, rehearsing all the ways I’m failing. Although, to be fair, the coffee might just be my own personal failing, amplified.

interviewer: It sounds like this has been a gradual but persistent struggle... Have you noticed any specific events or changes in the past year that might have made these symptoms worse?

patient: I guess the divorce was a big one—though I keep telling myself it’s just ‘life stuff.’ But then there’s the... the financial mess from trying to ‘fix’ things on my own. Private sessions add up when you’re supposed to be the expert, right? It’s ironic, I know. And work? I can’t even trust my own judgment anymore. It’s like I’m watching myself unravel, but I just keep making coffee and pretending it’s enough.

interviewer: It sounds like financial stress has added another layer to your already heavy workload... How has this financial strain been affecting your ability to manage daily tasks or responsibilities outside of work?

patient: Professional failure, I guess? It’s like the molasses thing gets thicker when I’m juggling bill reminders and... client files. I’ve started leaving grocery shopping until the last minute, which just adds to the ‘efficient’ list of things I’m screwing up. Coffee helps me function, but even that feels like a Band-Aid on a broken pipe. Honestly? I’m surprised I haven’t missed a mortgage payment yet—but maybe that’s just wishful thinking.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by multiple pressures right now. What would you most like to see change or improve through working together?

patient: I guess... I want to stop feeling like I’m one missed step away from collapsing. Like, if I could just *wake up* with the energy to shower without it feeling like I’m excavating a ditch, or remember that clients have lives outside my notes... That sounds ridiculous, right? Maybe I’m just asking for a brain that doesn’t turn my coffee into a placebo every morning.

interviewer: It makes sense that those daily struggles feel so significant when your energy and focus are already stretched thin... When did you first notice these symptoms starting to interfere with your work as a counselor?

patient: It’s hard to pinpoint the exact moment, but... maybe two years ago? Around when the divorce was finalizing. I started forgetting clients’ names, then second-guessing my notes—like I’d question if I’d even *met* them. I told myself it was ‘burnout,’ you know? But the fog just... thickened. I’d go through the motions, like a therapist who needs therapy. It’s embarrassing to admit, but I’d catch myself staring at my coffee mug, wondering how I got here. The financial stuff? That’s just... salt in the wound.

interviewer: It sounds like your symptoms have evolved since the initial onset... How have they changed or progressed over the past two years, especially in the last year?

patient: It’s like the fog... it used to be morning-only. Now it lingers all day. I’ll be in sessions and suddenly blank on a client’s name, then panic-check my notes like maybe *writing* it made me forget. The wine at night? It’s not ‘nothing’ anymore—it’s the only time I don’t feel like I’m failing at existing. And the bills... I’ve started hiding notices in my ‘work’ pile. If I can’t fix the molasses, at least I can pretend it’s not oozing into my clients’ files too. Pathetic, right?

interviewer: It sounds like the wine has become a significant part of your routine to cope... How has this change in substance use affected your daily functioning or symptoms?

patient: It’s... it’s not like I’m blacking out or anything. But the wine? It’s the only thing that lets me... shut off the static at night. The problem is, I wake up so groggy, like the molasses has turned to concrete. My head’s foggy, and I wonder if I’m just trading one problem for another. But what’s the alternative? Coffee that doesn’t even work anymore?

interviewer: It sounds like the combination of professional demands and personal challenges has been overwhelming lately. Have you had similar periods in the past where you felt this level of fatigue and difficulty concentrating? If so, what helped during those times?

patient: There was... the divorce, I guess. That year I was working late every night, telling myself it was about staying competent. Coffee, lots of coffee. But now even that feels like... pushing water uphill. The wine helps, but it’s just a glass, really. What’s the point of talking about it if nothing actually... changes? It’s like trying to fix a car without the manual.

interviewer: That sounds really tough... Can you tell me what strategies or supports helped you cope during the divorce period, if any?

patient: I... I guess I just kept busy. Work was a distraction, you know? If I stayed late enough, there was less time to... think. Coffee, lots of coffee. And a glass of wine at night, nothing serious. But honestly, it’s like the fog just... thickened. The same tricks don’t work now. Do any of them ever really work?

interviewer: That sounds really tough... Have you experienced episodes like this before, where your usual coping strategies stopped working, and if so, what eventually helped you regain a sense of control?

patient: I guess... in the past, I just kept going through the motions. Work, coffee, that glass of wine. But it was like... patching holes with tape. Now even that feels like it's not holding. I don't know. Maybe I was in denial before? Telling myself 'I'm fine' until it wasn't an option anymore. But now... there's no tape left.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone... Can you think of any people or resources that have supported you during tough times like the divorce period?

patient: I guess... work was the only thing keeping me from falling apart completely. I had to at least *appear* competent for my clients, you know? And coffee. Always coffee. But asking for help? That’s not really... my thing. I mean, who’s going to take a therapist seriously if they admit they’re drowning?

interviewer: It's understandable to feel that way given your profession... Are there any other people or resources—colleagues, friends, or even professional networks—you might turn to, even in small ways, when things feel overwhelming?

patient: I guess... I try to keep showing up for work, you know? If I’m at least *doing* the job, it feels like I’m not completely failing. There’s this... group chat with a few colleagues where we swap client tips sometimes. But honestly, I just read their messages quickly and nod. Who’s going to take a therapist seriously if they admit they’re drowning? And coffee. Always coffee. It’s the only thing that keeps me from... collapsing entirely. Maybe if I pretend long enough, I’ll believe it too.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone... Are there any colleagues, friends, or professionals you feel you could reach out to, even for small moments of support, when the pressure feels overwhelming?

patient: Honestly? I’ve tried... there’s Jane in the office, but I don’t want to sound like I’m... you know, failing. We swap coffee sometimes, but that’s about it. Most days, I just power through or pour a glass of wine and pretend I’m ‘decompressing.’ It’s not like anyone’s going to call child services for overthinking, right?

interviewer: I want to ask about something you mentioned earlier—when you said you’ve been thinking about not waking up some mornings. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life, even if it feels like a distant possibility?

patient: I... it’s not like I’m making plans or anything. Some mornings, lying there, I just think, *Why bother?* But then I remember the coffee—black, bitter, necessary—and figure I might as well keep going. It’s not dramatic, just... quiet. Like the molasses thing. Sometimes I wonder if the weight will just crush me, but other times I force myself to move. It’s probably just... tiredness.

interviewer: That sounds really heavy to carry. Have you ever had any plan or specific thoughts about how you would act on those feelings of not wanting to wake up?

patient: No, not really... It’s more like... some mornings I think, *What’s the point?* But then I smell the coffee brewing and... I guess that’s my cue to keep faking it. It’s not like I’d ever... you know. Just... the thought of *doing* anything feels like trying to swim through those paint tubes from college. Solid, but... there’s no real plan. Just... hoping the coffee’s strong enough today.

interviewer: I hear how heavy this feels, even if it's not in a planned way. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol use recently, or do you find yourself relying on it more to manage these feelings?

patient: The wine? It’s... not like I’m downing bottles or anything. Just a glass. To, you know, unwind. But then I lie there thinking about how the coffee keeps me 'functional' and the wine just... numbs the edges. I guess it’s a bit of a paradox. But I’m not *relying* on it. Probably. Most nights, I just can’t decide if I want to feel anything at all.

interviewer: It seems like the wine is serving as a way to cope with difficult emotions, even if it feels paradoxical. How often have you been having a glass of wine in the past month?

patient: Probably... three or four times a week? Maybe more. It’s just... something to take the edge off. Not like I can’t still function, though. I mean, I’m here every morning for coffee, right? It’s not like it’s ruining anything.

interviewer: Have you been using any other substances, like cannabis, stimulants, or opioids, either regularly or occasionally?

patient: No, just... the wine. Occasionally. It’s not like I’m experimenting with anything else. I mean, the wine is just... a way to unwind after work, you know? It helps me sleep sometimes. Probably more than it should, but it’s not like I’m chasing a high or anything. I guess I could cut back, but it’s not exactly a problem, right?

interviewer: It sounds like the wine is a way to cope with the day’s weight. Have you been taking any medications or supplements, including over-the-counter ones, to manage your symptoms or sleep?

patient: No medications, really. Just... melatonin sometimes. If I’m being honest, I take it more often than I should, but it’s not like it’s Adderall or something. I guess the coffee counts too? Black, bitter stuff—keeps me from collapsing at my desk. It’s just... practical, right? You need to function as a professional. Even if the function is... shaky.

interviewer: I want to ask about energy patterns—have you noticed any times when you feel unusually energetic or restless, even with little sleep, over the past few months?

patient: Not really. I mean, the coffee keeps me going, but it’s more like... I can’t sit still sometimes. My hands get shaky, but that’s probably just the caffeine. I guess if I’m up all night, I still feel like I need to keep moving, you know? Like my body’s stuck on ‘go’ even when my brain’s mush.

interviewer: It sounds like your energy feels more like a struggle to stay functional than a surge. Have you noticed any times when your thoughts feel unusually fast or crowded, like you can’t stop them from racing, even if you’re still feeling tired?

patient: It’s more like... static, I guess. Like a thousand radio stations playing at once but none of them making sense. The coffee doesn’t help—it just makes the static louder, you know? I try to focus on work to drown it out, but even that feels like fighting a tide. It’s not racing, exactly... it’s just... there. All the time.

interviewer: Have you noticed any recent urges to engage in impulsive or risky behaviors, like spending sprees, reckless driving, or making major decisions without usual caution, even when feeling tired?

patient: No, not really. I mean, I’ve been... careful, I guess. The divorce made me more cautious about big decisions. Though sometimes I wonder if I’m overcompensating—like, I’ll double-check every email before sending, you know? It’s not exactly reckless. Maybe... the coffee? My coworker says I’m a human espresso machine. But it’s just survival, right?

interviewer: I note how you're using caffeine and wine to manage both alertness and emotional weight. Have you been taking any other medications or supplements besides melatonin to help with sleep or other symptoms?

patient: Honestly? Just coffee in the mornings and maybe a glass of wine at night. I know it’s not exactly... ideal. But it’s manageable, I guess. I’m the therapist who needs therapy, right? Oh, and the melatonin, of course. Nothing else really. I can’t afford anything else with the... stuff at home.

interviewer: Have you noticed any experiences with seeing, hearing, or believing things that others might not, like hallucinations, strong delusions, or paranoid thoughts in the past few months?

patient: Not really... I mean, sometimes I overanalyze things at work, you know? Like, I’ll second-guess a diagnosis so much it feels like my brain’s stuck in a loop. But actual... paranoid thoughts? No. Though I did have this weird moment the other day where I thought someone was talking about me in the hallway. Turned out it was just the janitor’s radio. I’m the therapist who needs therapy, right?

interviewer: Wanda, you’ve shared a lot about feeling stuck in your work as a therapist, the weight of ongoing fatigue and sleep disruptions, and how these challenges have made even basic tasks feel overwhelming. You’ve also mentioned concerns about your professional performance and a sense of emotional numbness that’s been growing since your divorce. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?

patient: I think you missed how the 'fog' isn’t just work-related—it’s everywhere now. Like, even the coffee and wine... they’re not just habits. They’re the only things keeping me from dissolving into that static. But I guess you did get the part where I’m terrified of being a 'failure.' Just... maybe not how the debt from my own therapy sessions is another layer of that shame. I tell myself it’s 'self-care,' but it’s more like... proof I can’t even fix what’s broken. I’m the therapist who needs therapy, after all.

interviewer: It sounds like the mental fog and reliance on coffee and wine are part of a deeper struggle with self-criticism and shame, especially around therapy debt. What did I miss about how these factors connect for you?

patient: It’s... like the debt is this quiet hum under everything else. I tell myself it’s ‘investing’ in my own head, but it feels more like I’m just... paying interest on a loan I’ll never repay. The coffee and wine? They’re just bandages for the same wound. I guess what’s hardest is knowing I can’t even fix the fix. (pauses, avoids eye contact) I’m the therapist who needs therapy, so what does that make everyone else?

interviewer: It sounds like the therapy debt adds a layer of shame that even the small fixes feel like admissions of failure. What did I miss about how this connects to the rest of what you’ve shared?

patient: It’s... like the debt isn’t just numbers. It’s this... extra weight in the static. Every time I think about those bills, it’s like the fog gets thicker. (pauses, rubs temples) I tell myself I’m ‘prioritizing my health,’ but it just feels like another way I’m failing at being the kind of therapist who... who has it together. The coffee and wine? They’re not fixes—they’re just... proof I’m still trying to pretend. (soft laugh) I’m the therapist who needs therapy, after all.

interviewer: Wanda, to recap: We’ve explored how your work as a therapist has become overwhelming, with fatigue, mental fog, and sleep disturbances making even basic tasks feel exhausting. The emotional weight of therapy debt and self-criticism about professional competence seems to compound these challenges, while caffeine and wine offer temporary relief but not resolution. What did I miss or get wrong about how all of this connects for you?

patient: I think you got the fog part right—the molasses thing is still accurate. What’s maybe missing is how the debt... it’s not just the numbers. It’s this quiet guilt, like I’m failing even at fixing myself. The coffee and wine? They’re just bandages. I tell myself I’ll ‘get it together’ next week, but the weeks just... stack. I guess I’m the classic therapist who needs therapy. It’s all so... circular.

interviewer: It sounds like the debt adds a layer of guilt where even investing in therapy feels like a failure, creating a cycle where you’re both trying to fix yourself and proving you can’t. What did I miss or get wrong about how this all connects?

patient: It’s... it’s not just the debt itself. It’s the way it hums in the background, like a bad song you can’t turn off. I tell myself the coffee keeps me functional at work, but then the wine at night just... numbs the edges. The worst part is knowing I’m the one who needs to fix this, but every time I try, the fog just thickens. I guess I’m stuck proving I can’t, even while I’m trying. It’s ridiculous, really—here I am, the therapist who can’t even fix her own brain.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing all of this, Wanda. To wrap up, let's review next steps: we've discussed therapy as a starting point, and I'll provide resources for managing fatigue and emotional overwhelm. If you're ever feeling that 'not wanting to wake up' becomes more intense, who could you reach out to for support? Also, is there anything else you'd like to clarify before we finish today?

patient: I... I have my supervisor’s card, I guess. For work stuff. And my sister’s always texting me about family stuff, but I don’t know if I’d bother her. Probably just keep chugging coffee and pretending the fog lifts by Tuesday. As for the ‘not wanting to wake up’ thing? I’ll… cross that bridge if I get there. It’s just a phase, right? Therapist who needs therapy and all that.

interviewer: It sounds like reaching out for support feels both necessary and difficult for you. Who would you feel most comfortable contacting if you noticed those 'not wanting to wake up' thoughts becoming stronger?

patient: I guess... my supervisor’s card is there for work stuff. But I don’t know if I’d actually pick up the phone. My sister’s always texting me about family things, but I don’t want to ‘burden’ her with... this. It’s just a phase, right? The fog’ll lift. Who else would even understand? The coffee’s cheaper than a therapist, after all.

interviewer: It sounds like reaching out feels like a tightrope between needing help and protecting others from your struggles. Before we finish, is there anything else you'd want to clarify or carry forward as next steps?

patient: I guess... the coffee keeps me afloat, but the fog—it’s always there. I’ll stick with the supervisor’s card if I have to, but I’m not sure I’ll use it. Maybe if the fog doesn’t lift by next week... I’ll cross that bridge. It’s just another loop, really. The coffee’s cheaper than a therapist, after all.
