system: Session 2bd4076c-3593-45fb-9499-85bfe733fe60 transcript

system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Cynthia, before we begin, are you comfortable proceeding with this interview today?

patient: Yes, of course—I just need to make sure I’m not going to blank out halfway through. Work’s been... hectic lately, what with the new charting system, but I’m used to juggling. Probably overthinking it, as usual. You know, I’m the Queen of Catastrophizing, your Majesty.

interviewer: It sounds like you're really hard on yourself about overthinking—many people relate to that. Before we move forward, would you like to ask any questions about how this session will go?

patient: No, I think I’ve already overcomplicated things enough. I’m just worried I’ll space out or say something silly. But I guess that’s just me—always the Queen of Catastrophizing. It’s like my brain’s on fast-forward and the brake pedal’s stuck. You’ll have to forgive the rambling if it happens!

interviewer: That sounds really tough. Today’s session will focus on understanding your current concerns and how we can support you. Does that sound okay with you?

patient: Sure, that sounds... reasonable. I just hope I don’t overcomplicate things. It’s like my brain’s on fast-forward and the brake pedal’s stuck, but I’ll try to keep it simple. You’ll have to forgive the occasional tangent—old habits, you know? I’m the Queen of Catastrophizing, your Majesty.

interviewer: Have you experienced similar episodes of anxiety or stress in the past, and if so, what helped you manage them at the time?

patient: Yeah, definitely. Work stress, like when we switched to digital charts last year—I spent weeks second-guessing every entry. Caffeine helps, though. And forcing myself to stick to routines, you know? Like, if I sort my meds three times, I can at least pretend I’m in control. Probably overkill, but better safe than sorry. You’d think I’d learn to trust myself, but here we are. The Queen of Catastrophizing, your Majesty.

interviewer: It sounds like your routines and caffeine are part of your strategy to cope with work stress. Can you tell me about your partner? How have they been supporting you during this stressful time?

patient: They’re… good. Really, they are. My partner’s been pretty understanding, even when I’m irritable—though I apologize for that way too much, probably. They just… let me have my space when I need to focus on work stuff. It’s not like they don’t have their own stuff to worry about, you know? Student loans and all. We don’t talk about everything, but… they’re there. Quietly. It’s probably normal, I guess.

interviewer: Have you been using alcohol or cannabis recently, or any other substances?

patient: A glass of wine? Sure, probably more than I should, but it’s just… noise reduction, you know? Helps me unwind after the chaos of the day. I mean, who doesn’t? It’s not like I’m passed out on the couch or missing work or anything. No cannabis or pills or whatever—can’t afford to mess up my head when I’m on shift. My hands still shake a bit in the mornings, though. Maybe I should cut back, but… it’s not like it’s a problem, right?

interviewer: That sounds like a common way to unwind, but I want to check if you're using any other substances, like stimulants or opioids, to manage stress or symptoms?

patient: No, definitely not stimulants or anything like that. I mean, coffee’s a crutch, sure—I’m one of those people who needs it to function before 9 a.m. But it’s just… coffee. My hands still tremor a bit when I’m nervous, but I tell myself it’s just caffeine jitters. Probably nothing to worry about. Though, to be honest, I’ve been thinking about cutting back. Again.

interviewer: Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including over-the-counter ones, to manage your symptoms or other health concerns?

patient: No medications, really. I mean, I take a multivitamin sometimes—probably more when I’m stressed about work. And maybe ibuprofen for my neck if the charting system’s driving me nuts, but that’s just… life, right? I’m not a pill-popper. Though I guess the wine is technically a supplement? Not helping, but also not exactly a fix. My hands still shake a bit, but I tell myself it’s just… caffeine and stress. Probably.

interviewer: I hear how you're managing physical symptoms like hand tremors with humor, but it's important to check for other patterns. Have you noticed periods of feeling unusually energetic or needing less sleep while dealing with stress, even if it felt overwhelming?

patient: No, I don’t really feel unusually energetic. It’s more like I’m always on edge, you know? Like my brain’s stuck on high alert. I do restlessness, not energy. Though I guess the coffee doesn’t help—probably just keeps me from collapsing entirely.

interviewer: Have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts recently?

patient: Hallucinations? No, I’m not that creative under stress. But I’ll admit—I’ve been hyper-vigilant at work lately. Like, I double-check those digital charts so many times it probably slows things down for everyone. My boss said something about ‘overseeing’ the process, but I guess that’s just my version of paranoia. Though honestly, after that near-error with a patient’s meds, I’d rather err on the side of annoying nurses than risk a mistake. It’s like my brain’s on fast-forward and the brake pedal’s stuck, you know? Probably nothing, but… have you ever noticed how construction noise makes you jump? It’s like every creak in the building feels like a warning sign now.

interviewer: It sounds like your work environment is adding a lot of pressure, and your body’s responding with tension and restlessness. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life, even if just in passing?

patient: No, I mean—good Lord, no. I’d be the worst at that. I can’t even commit to a Netflix show, let alone something like that. It’s just… the static, you know? The ‘what if I just disappeared’ thing? I tell myself it’s stupid, like thinking about turning off the TV when the noise gets too much. But then I overcompensate with the wine, the routines, the step count nonsense. It’s all just… noise cancellation. Probably overthinking it. Again.

interviewer: It sounds like your partner provides a grounding presence. Who else do you find yourself turning to when things feel especially overwhelming?

patient: Honestly? Not many. My sister’s in Berlin now, and we mostly just send memes back and forth. It’s… efficient. I used to vent to a coworker, but they got moved to night shifts, and I don’t want to bother anyone with my ‘static.’ My herbs help, though—digging in the soil feels like a reset button. Though half the time I’m just distracted by the construction noise, wondering if the building’s actually falling apart. Probably overthinking again. [Rubbs temples, pauses] My hands are shaking a bit, but I tell myself it’s just bad posture from staring at charts all day.

interviewer: Based on what you've shared, it sounds like the new charting system at work has intensified your anxiety, leading to sleepless nights, physical tension, and worries about making mistakes. You've been managing stress through routines and caffeine, but it's affecting your focus and mood. What did I miss or get wrong about how this has been unfolding for you?

patient: You didn’t mention the construction noise driving me nuts—every hammer hit feels like a warning bell. And maybe the... hmm, the way my hands tremble when I’m trying to type charts at midnight? It’s like my body’s a metronome set to ‘anxious’—steady, annoying, unavoidable. But hey, at least I’m not *complaining*. Just... recalibrating.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been managing a lot of stress recently—would you like to ask anything before we wrap up today? I'm here to help clarify next steps or anything else on your mind.

patient: I guess… if it’s not too much to ask, maybe you could clarify if the charting system confusion is something others struggle with too? I keep second-guessing if it’s just me being slow. And— [pauses, rubs neck] —if there are… non-medicine ways to quiet the static at night. But honestly, I probably just need to stop overthinking. My hands are shaking again, but it’s probably just caffeine withdrawal.

interviewer: That sounds really tough... Could you tell me if the hand tremors are impacting your ability to complete tasks at work?

patient: Honestly? They’re… noticeable, especially when I’m typing charts late at night. I blame the 3 PM coffee rush, you know? But I just… double-check everything to be safe. If the numbers are off, I redo them until they’re perfect. It’s probably overkill, but better that than a mistake, right? Though the construction noise outside doesn’t help—makes my hands jitter even more. I’m just… used to working around it by now.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy load to carry... Would you like to go over what we’ve discussed today and clarify any next steps before we wrap up?

patient: I guess the main stuff we’ve circled back to is the tremors, the charting system, and… you know, the usual suspects like coffee and wine. I’ve been double-checking everything at work to compensate, but it’s probably just my brain’s way of saying ‘slow down.’ The construction noise doesn’t help—feels like they’re hammering inside my skull half the time. As for next steps… maybe tweaking my routine? I could try scaling back the caffeine, but honestly, without it, I’d probably just be twitchier. The wine at night? I tell myself it’s just ‘unwinding,’ right? I’ll… see how the week goes. No big plans, though. Structure’s my thing, after all.

interviewer: It sounds like you're planning to adjust your routine by scaling back caffeine and monitoring alcohol use. Would you like to add anything else to these next steps before we conclude?

patient: Maybe I’ll try to focus more on the garden stuff—planting herbs helps me… I don’t know, reset? And I’ll keep sticking to the step count app. Small wins, right? Other than that, I think that’s it. The construction should quiet down soon, so maybe my hands will stop jittering as much. Probably just… recalibrate and see.
