system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Would you be comfortable proceeding with this interview today?

patient: Sure, I guess. Just... been a long week. Didn’t sleep much. But I’m here, so let’s get it over with. Do you like succulents? The one I have... it’s doing okay, I think.

interviewer: That sounds really tough. Just to make sure we're on the same page, today's session will involve discussing how you've been feeling and exploring ways to help. Does that sound okay with you?

patient: Yeah, I mean... if it’s going to help, sure. Just don’t want to waste your time. I’ve got that order to finish tomorrow, you know how it is. The succulent’s rooting better, though—maybe it’ll survive after all.

interviewer: It sounds like you're balancing a lot right now—work, your plants, and everything else. Do you have any initial questions about what we’ll be discussing today?

patient: Honestly? I don’t really know what to expect. But as long as we’re not... wasting time. Got a stack of orders piling up. The succulent’s survived worse, I suppose. Just... don’t mind if I’m a bit slow today.

interviewer: I can see how juggling everything must be exhausting. Just to be clear, would you say you're comfortable with how this session will work and how long it might take?

patient: Yeah, I guess. As long as we don’t… stretch it too long. Got that dye order to finish by Friday. The succulent’s finally holding on, though—maybe that’s something, at least.

interviewer: What's been going on for you lately that's brought you here today?

patient: It’s the succulent, I guess. It’s been a while since it bloomed, and I’ve been up so much at night checking the soil. Work’s been a mess—mixed up some dye batches, and now I’m just... stuck. Like the plant, I guess. Not really... growing.

interviewer: That metaphor of feeling stuck like the succulent is powerful... Can you tell me why the succulent feels important to you right now?

patient: It’s… it’s the only thing that still makes sense to check on. Every morning, I make sure the soil’s not too dry. Feels like I’m doing something right, even if it’s just… small. But it’s not blooming, and I keep thinking maybe I’m not doing enough. Or maybe it’s just… stuck like I am. Doesn’t help that I’m up half the night anyway, so the checking’s just an excuse to… not sleep, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like the succulent's lack of blooming mirrors how you're feeling about your own progress. When did you first start noticing these feelings of being stuck and the changes in your sleep?

patient: It’s hard to pinpoint… Maybe after Mom passed? But it’s been worse lately. I just… can’t shake the feeling I’m not doing enough, you know? The plant, the orders—it’s like everything’s just… static. And the sleep? It’s not that I can’t sleep… I just end up checking the soil again, you know? Keeps me awake.

interviewer: It sounds like the static feeling is really affecting your confidence in both your work and personal life... Can you tell me more about how this has been impacting your ability to manage tasks at work?

patient: It’s like... the orders just pile up. I mixed up the dyes, and now I’m second-guessing everything—even the small stuff. Like, why can’t I just... get it right? But I don’t want to bother anyone with it. It’s probably just me being too tired. The plant at least... it doesn’t argue back.

interviewer: It sounds like work mistakes are adding to your stress and self-criticism... What do you think has been different in the past few weeks that might have made things feel worse?

patient: It’s... the deadlines piling up, I guess. Like the dye mix-up wasn’t bad enough, and now I’m second-guessing every color choice. Should’ve double-checked the labels, but I was tired. Always tired. And the nights? I just... lie there, you know? Even when I fall asleep, I wake up at 3 checking the succulent’s soil again. It’s like my brain won’t let up.

interviewer: It sounds like the recent work pressures and sleep disturbances are really affecting your confidence and energy. What are you hoping to achieve by coming in for this session?

patient: I guess... I just want to stop feeling so stuck. Like that succulent, you know? It’s not dying, but it’s not... growing. I don’t know. Maybe figure out how to keep it alive without overthinking it. And the orders? They’re just piling up. Can’t even focus on the colors right, like that dye mix-up. No big deal, really. Just... hoping to get back on track, I suppose.

interviewer: It sounds like carrying this weight alone has been really isolating... Have you experienced similar periods of feeling down or stuck in the past, and if so, what helped you during those times?

patient: I guess... when my dad was sick, I spent years just fixing things around the house so he’d be comfortable. Never really stopped to think if I was okay. This feels different, though. Back then, the work had a point. Now it’s just... keeping the hands busy. The succulent? I’ve had it through worse. Just keep it in the light, right? Water it a little. Doesn’t need much. I guess that’s what I’m trying to do.

interviewer: Your comparison to your dad's time reminds me how different this feels for you now. Have you experienced other periods where you felt emotionally or physically stuck in a way that was similar or different to this?

patient: I guess... when my dad was sick, but that was different. Back then, the work had a point. Now it’s just... keeping the hands busy. The orders? They’re piling up. Can’t even focus on the colors right, like that dye mix-up. No big deal, really. Just... tired, I think. Sleep’s been worse lately. The succulent? It’s still okay. Just... needs light, right? Doesn’t need someone who can’t even get their own head together.

interviewer: It sounds like your work responsibilities are adding to the weight you're carrying. Are there people in your life who you can rely on for support when things feel overwhelming, or is it mostly just you handling it?

patient: My partner? They’re... there. I mean, they’re not the type to nag, which is probably why they let me do all the work around here. Keeps their mug in the sink, but I guess that’s just how they are. My sister? They’re always posting about their life, you know? Happy stuff. But I don’t want to burden anyone. The orders, the succulent, the coffee mug—stuff like that? I can handle it. Just... keep the hands busy, right?

interviewer: That sounds really tough to carry alone... Have you had any thoughts about ending your life or hurting yourself recently?

patient: I don’t mind the idea of not waking up, if that’s what you’re asking. But I can’t leave them dealing with... this. The orders, the sink, the stupid coffee mug. I’d just... get in the way. I don’t drink much. Just a glass sometimes. Helps the hands stop fidgeting. The succulent’s still alive, though. That’s something, right?

interviewer: I hear how painful that feels, carrying all of that alone... Have you thought about how or when you might not wake up?

patient: I guess... sometimes I just lie there, you know? Staring at the ceiling till it’s all white. But it’s not like I’d do anything about it. The succulent needs checking, and... I don’t want to leave them with the sink full of dishes.

interviewer: It sounds like the thought of not waking up is more of a passive feeling than an active plan... Have you thought about any specific way or steps you might take to not wake up?

patient: I guess you could say it’s... not exactly planning. More like the thought’s there when I’m up at 3 a.m., staring at the ceiling. But what’s the point in thinking about it? The succulent needs repotting, and the cat’s litter’s a mess. You can’t just... leave stuff like that. Besides, they’d figure it out eventually. Probably blame themselves. No sense adding to that, right?

interviewer: It sounds like your sense of responsibility is a strong part of what’s keeping you grounded... Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or mood that feel different from your sleep pattern? For example, feeling more restless or wired at times?

patient: I guess... my hands are always doing something, even when my head’s stuck. Like last week, I spent an hour reorganizing fabric scraps by thread count—useless, really. But if I don’t, I just... fidget. It’s like my brain’s on fire, but I’m stuck tending to the succulent’s roots instead. The vet said the cat’s been knocking things over more. Maybe I’m just... jumpy?

interviewer: I hear how that restlessness feels physically demanding... How often have you been drinking alcohol lately, and have you noticed any changes in how it affects you?

patient: A glass here and there, I guess. Helps with the... noise in my head. But lately, it’s just making my hands shake more. The cat’s been spitting up hairballs everywhere, so I blame the wine. Doesn’t help, though. Just... numbs the edges for a bit. Not like it used to.

interviewer: I hear how the alcohol's effects have shifted... Have you been using anything else besides alcohol, like cannabis, prescription medications, or other substances?

patient: No, really—it’s just the wine. Once in a while, maybe a joint if the cat’s out of the room, but that’s it. Doesn’t do much anymore, just… numbs the edges. The vet gave her something for the hairballs, but that’s not me, I guess.

interviewer: I hear how the cannabis use has also become less effective for you... Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements for your symptoms or other health concerns?

patient: No, nothing prescribed. I don’t like bothering the doctor for every little thing. Maybe a glass of wine now and then, but it’s just to… settle the nerves, you know? The cat’s been throwing up hairballs again. Had to clean that up this morning before work.

interviewer: I hear how you're managing with small coping strategies... Have you been using any other substances, like stimulants, opioids, or other drugs, either prescribed or not?

patient: Nope. Just the wine, really. Though sometimes I wonder if the cat’s allergies are my fault… I mean, I do leave the garage door open sometimes. The succulent’s been doing better, at least. Maybe I’ll propagate a cutting soon. You know, to… pass the time.

interviewer: From what you've shared, it sounds like you've been feeling down and empty for several months, with trouble sleeping, losing interest in crafts, and feeling overwhelmed at work. These symptoms seem to have started after your mother's death and have gotten worse with work deadlines. You've been trying to manage on your own but are now realizing you need help. You mentioned feeling stuck, like your succulent, but still trying to take care of responsibilities like your cat. What did I miss?

patient: I guess the other thing is... I messed up a dye batch last week. Just... added the wrong thing. Cost the shop a day’s work. Can’t even bother to fix it now. And I keep thinking I’m dragging my partner down, but I don’t say it. They deserve better. Sometimes I watch this crime show. Helps... a little. But I’d never admit it.

interviewer: It sounds like the dye mistake and worries about burdening your partner are adding to the weight you're carrying. What would be most helpful for us to focus on next—talking more about how we might support you, or are there other concerns we haven't touched on yet?

patient: I guess... the succulent. It’s the only thing that feels... solid, you know? But I don’t want to bother anyone with all the rest. The dye thing was just a mistake. Happens, I suppose. The cat’s been better lately, at least.

interviewer: It sounds like taking care of your succulent and your cat gives you some stability right now. How would you like to proceed with next steps for support?

patient: I guess… if we had to pick, maybe just keeping the focus on small things? Like, if there’s a way to make sure I don’t mess up the next dye batch. It’s just… stupid, really. And the succulent, yeah, propagating it would be something solid to do. But don’t bother with the rest of it. Old problems, nothing new.

interviewer: It makes sense to focus on what feels manageable right now. Let’s make sure we have a clear plan for next steps—what would you like to carry forward from our time today?

patient: I’ll... keep an eye on the succulent. If it survives, maybe I’m doing something right. And I’ll try not to mix up the dye batches again. Can’t have the shop thinking I’m useless.
