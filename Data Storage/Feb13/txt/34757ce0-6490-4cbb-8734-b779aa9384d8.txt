system: Session 34757ce0-6490-4cbb-8734-b779aa9384d8 transcript

system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: It sounds like you've been through a lot lately, and I appreciate you reaching out for help. Would you be comfortable proceeding with this session today?

patient: Yes, thank you. It’s… been a rough patch lately, but I’m trying to stay on top of things. To be honest, I’ve always had a tendency to overanalyze everything—probably part of being a doctor. My husband just says I need vacation, but I think it’s more… complicated than that.

interviewer: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially given the demands of your profession. Would you like me to briefly explain how this session will work?

patient: Oh, I imagine it’s not too different from a patient consultation—ask questions, assess symptoms… though I suppose without the stethoscope. Honestly, I’m just hoping we can be efficient with time. My husband keeps saying I need a vacation, but I think there’s more to it than that.

interviewer: I appreciate your focus on efficiency—I’ll aim to keep our time structured but open for what feels most pressing for you. Just to clarify, this session will involve exploring what’s been going on for you over the next hour, with a focus on understanding your current experience. Does that sound right to you?

patient: Yes, structured makes sense. I’ve always preferred clear parameters—probably from years in medicine. Though lately, even that feels... elusive. (Pauses, then softens with a wry smile) My husband keeps insisting I need a vacation, but I suspect he doesn’t fully grasp how... complex this is. Let’s just say I’m here now, so we might as well proceed.

interviewer: That critical error at work sounds deeply unsettling for you. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened and how it made you feel in the moment?

patient: It was a lab result for a diabetic patient—something that should have been flagged for critical elevation. I missed it, and they ended up in the ER three days later. (Pauses, avoids eye contact) The worst part isn’t the error itself… it’s that I *knew* better. My father always said, ‘A surgeon who isn’t 200% sharp isn’t worth the scalpels.’ Now I feel like… (soft, bitter laugh) like I’m proving him right. My husband says I’m overthinking it, but how do you explain to someone that it’s not the mistake—it’s the *certainty* that it’s only the first of many?

interviewer: That sounds really tough. When did this error happen in relation to when you first noticed these feelings of being overwhelmed and disconnected?

patient: The error was about six months ago—November, I think. It’s hard to untangle what came first, honestly. The guilt, the sleepless nights... they all sort of bled together. I’ve always been a perfectionist, so maybe this was just my brain’s way of catching up to me. I told myself it was stress, but...

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. How often have you been waking up early and struggling to fall back asleep since November, and how has that affected your energy or focus during the day?

patient: It’s been... most nights, honestly. I wake up around 3 or 4 a.m. and just lie there, going over patient files in my head. I tell myself it’s because I’m ‘double-checking’ my work, but I know it’s just my brain punishing me. I start the day with green tea, then an energy drink if I’m supposed to cook lunch for the family. It keeps me going, but by afternoon, my thoughts feel like they’re moving through syrup. I’ve started documenting every tiny detail in charts to... to make sure I didn’t miss anything. My husband says I’m overcompensating, but I guess that’s part of getting older, right?

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. What are your hopes for how we might work together to support you?

patient: I guess... I hope we can figure out a way to... streamline my thoughts. Maybe create some sort of... system to prevent these... lapses. My husband deserves someone who isn't... constantly second-guessing herself. I just want to be... functional again.

interviewer: It sounds like regaining that sense of efficiency is really important to you. What have you been doing recently to manage these challenges, and has anything helped or made things worse?

patient: I’ve been... trying to organize my tasks more methodically, breaking down my day into smaller steps. It helps, but only up to a point. The energy drinks keep me functional through the afternoons, though they make my hands shake sometimes. My husband keeps saying I should rest, but I feel guilty slowing down. There’s this... mango chutney I used to love making, but I forget to actually taste it now. I guess that’s part of getting older—losing the ability to enjoy the little things.

interviewer: It sounds like the mango chutney was a meaningful ritual for you. Have there been other activities or hobbies you’ve noticed yourself avoiding or no longer enjoying as you once did?

patient: The gardening... I used to look forward to it on Sundays. Now it feels childish, like a waste of time when I should be 'productive.' I still watch *The West Wing* reruns sometimes—it’s the only thing that feels structured enough to... I don’t know, ground me. But even that feels like I’m cheating, like I should be doing something more meaningful instead. My husband brought home some marigold seeds last week. I just... forgot to plant them.

interviewer: It sounds like gardening used to be an important part of your routine. When did you first notice it starting to feel like a waste of time instead of something you looked forward to?

patient: It’s... complicated. I’d say about six months ago, maybe? After the lab incident. I used to look forward to the marigolds, but now it feels like... like I’m wasting time that could be spent being productive. My hands still remember the motions, but the joy? Gone. I tell myself it’s just a rough patch, but...

interviewer: That shift from looking forward to gardening to feeling it's a waste of time sounds like a significant change. Have there been other activities or roles you've noticed yourself distancing from recently, even if they used to matter to you?

patient: I’ve been avoiding the kitchen lately. Cooking used to be... a way to connect with my family, but now it feels like I’m just going through the motions. I tell myself it’s because of long hours at work, but even when I’m home, the thought of preparing a meal feels... pointless. I end up ordering takeout more often, which I hate because it feels like another failure to maintain even basic routines.

interviewer: Have you experienced similar periods of stress or burnout in the past, perhaps related to work or personal life?

patient: Burnout? I suppose every residency has its... grueling stretches. There was a period after my fellowship when I was juggling three clinics, but I told myself that’s just part of the job. Honestly, I’ve always been a perfectionist—my father would have called it 'weakness' if I’d slowed down. (pauses, then softer) But this... this feels different. The fatigue isn’t lifting, and the guilt—it’s not just tired. It’s heavier.

interviewer: It sounds like the guilt you're experiencing now carries a weight that past challenges didn't have. Have you had other periods in your life or career where you felt overwhelmed by similar emotional or physical exhaustion, and if so, what helped you manage it back then?

patient: There was... residency. Long hours, constant pressure. I just told myself to power through. (pauses, rubs fingers together) Energy drinks, extra sleepless nights—usual fixes. But this? (shakes head slightly) This isn’t something I can ‘fix.’ The guilt is louder, and even when I try to push, my body... resists. It’s like my nerves are frayed, but I can’t quite... (voice trails off, then softer) I keep waiting for it to pass. It hasn’t.

interviewer: It sounds like this current experience is more intense and persistent than past challenges. Have you experienced any significant traumatic events or adversities in your life that might be contributing to this sense of overwhelm?

patient: Traumatic? (smiles tightly) My father had a way of making every meal feel like a performance review. But I’ve always had... high standards. (pauses, rubs thumb over ring) The lab error—it’s the first time I’ve ever felt like my own mind was betraying me. Like software needing debugging. (softly) Before that, I just... worked harder. This? This is new.

interviewer: It sounds like your relationship with your father influenced how you approach challenges and perfectionism. Can you share more about how that dynamic shaped your responses to stress or mistakes over time?

patient: My father was... a perfectionist in the way a machine is. If a valve leaks, you don’t ask *why* the valve failed—you replace it. I guess I learned to view mistakes as... software bugs. You debug, move on. But that lab error? It felt like a virus in the system. My husband says I’m overthinking, but how do you explain to someone that your own brain feels like it’s running a corrupted file?

interviewer: It sounds like the way you were raised to handle mistakes feels at odds with the emotional weight you're carrying now. How has your husband supported you during this time, and have there been moments when his support felt helpful or different from what you needed?

patient: He’s... quiet, you know? Like a scalpel—precise but not... warm. He brings me tea, says I need rest. It’s practical, which helps. But when I try to talk about... the weight, he nods and changes the subject. I don’t blame him. Maybe I don’t know how to explain it’s not just tiredness. It’s like... debugging a system no one else can see.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing so much already. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life in the past few weeks?

patient: Honestly... I’ve had moments where I think, 'What’s the point of waking up?' but I tell myself it’s just... exhaustion. Like a system needing a forced reboot. My husband’s patience is the only thing keeping me from... well, I don’t know. Let’s just say I still check my pulse every morning to prove I’m functioning.

interviewer: I hear how overwhelming this must feel, especially with the added pressure of your profession. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life specifically, beyond the exhaustion you mentioned?

patient: It’s… not that I want to stop existing. More like wondering if the code could use a forced reboot. But then I think of my husband’s quiet patience and… I check my pulse again to confirm I’m still running. It’s illogical, but I tell myself systems don’t shut down unless the power fails.

interviewer: That sounds really tough. Have you ever engaged in self-harm or any behaviors where you intentionally hurt yourself to cope?

patient: I’ve never... I mean, if you count picking at scabs until they bleed, but that’s just... habit. Like a surgeon sterilizing a wound, you know? It’s not really... intentional. More like my hands moving on their own when my mind’s too busy debugging other things.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about this. Do you consider this habit of picking at scabs as a way to cope with stress or emotions, or does it feel more like an automatic behavior you’re not in control of?

patient: It’s… it’s more like a habit I can’t quite debug, if that makes sense. I find myself doing it when I’m… you know, going through routines, like double-checking patient files late at night. It’s not really about the scab itself, I think—it’s just my brain’s way of… fidgeting when the system’s under stress. My husband says I need to relax, but he doesn’t understand how these things just… loop. It’s probably just me being old and fussy.

interviewer: I hear how frustrating it is when stress triggers these automatic behaviors. Have you noticed any changes in your use of substances like energy drinks or green tea lately, especially with the sleep difficulties?

patient: I haven’t... increased the dosage, if that’s what you mean. The green tea keeps me sharp during rounds, even if it means lying awake afterward. It’s just maintenance, I suppose. My body’s efficiency wanes with age, like a machine needing more fuel to run the same program.

interviewer: I understand how relying on stimulants can feel like a necessary routine. Have you been using alcohol or cannabis to manage your sleep or energy levels recently?

patient: No, I haven’t… not alcohol or cannabis. My system’s already running on borrowed time as it is. The tea and energy drinks? At least they’re… legal. My husband would have a fit if he knew I was experimenting with anything else. Though, to be honest, I’ve always been a bit old-fashioned that way. It’s not like I have the bandwidth for new vices.

interviewer: I hear how you’re managing with what feels like a controlled routine. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements—prescribed or over-the-counter—that you’d like to mention, including things like sleep aids or multivitamins?

patient: Just a basic multivitamin—nothing fancy. My body’s a machine, after all, and machines need regular maintenance. My husband teases me about being ‘old-fashioned’ for not experimenting with anything stronger. To be honest, I don’t see the point in adding more variables to an already unstable system.

interviewer: Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or need for sleep lately, beyond what you’ve already mentioned about waking early?

patient: My energy... it's like a battery drain I can't quite troubleshoot. Mornings are the only time I feel marginally functional, but by afternoon, my hands start trembling—not from the tea anymore, just... nothing. My mind feels like it's running through syrup. It’s probably just getting older, though.

interviewer: It sounds like your energy levels have been quite variable lately. Have you experienced any periods in the past few months where you felt unusually energetic, irritable, or needed less sleep than usual?

patient: My energy's been... erratic, to be honest. I push through with extra tea and those chalky energy drinks, but it's like a software update—random crashes, unexpected restarts. Nights are worst; I'll lie awake until 3 a.m. double-checking patient files, even when my hands shake from too much caffeine. Sleep? I guess I'm sleeping *enough*... just not the right kind. My husband says I look like a sleep-deprived robot, but he doesn't get it—this is just the new OS, right? Slower, glitchier, but functional.

interviewer: I hear how unpredictable your energy has been lately, especially with those late nights reviewing files. Have you experienced any periods in the past few months where you felt unusually energetic or needed significantly less sleep than usual?

patient: Unusually energetic? Not really. I just... run on fumes most nights. There are moments where I feel almost alert—like my system's rebooted—but it's just the caffeine kicking in. My husband jokes I'm a robot on auto-pilot, but he knows I'm just... being thorough. Even when I'm 'functional,' it's like I'm shadowboxing with the past.

interviewer: It sounds like your energy patterns are heavily influenced by caffeine and stress. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, such as hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or feeling suspicious about people’s intentions lately?

patient: No, nothing like that. My mind’s just… overloaded with the usual noise. Sometimes I second-guess every decision, like my internal audit system’s on high alert. But it’s not about others—it’s more like my own code throwing errors. I guess that makes me paranoid about my own reliability, not people’s intentions. My husband says I’m overcomplicating it. He’d call it ‘being a perfectionist.’ Which, sure, sounds less… clinical.

interviewer: Cathy, what I’ve heard so far is that you’ve been struggling with overwhelming stress, sleeplessness, and guilt after a recent work error, which feels different from past burnout. This has affected your energy, focus, and ability to enjoy things you once loved, while also straining your relationship with your husband. You’ve described a pattern of perfectionism tied to your upbringing, and though you’re worried about failing others, you’re also trying to manage passive thoughts about giving up. What did I miss?

patient: I think you captured the main currents… but maybe you missed how the guilt isn’t just about the lab error. It’s like… my brain keeps replaying every ‘almost mistake’ from the past year, magnifying them into proof I’m unraveling. And there’s this… quiet dread about my parents’ health declining, but I haven’t told my husband yet. I fear it’ll make me seem selfish, like I can’t even care about them without it becoming another ‘failure to meet standards.’ The ring helps, though—it’s the only thing that reminds me I’m not entirely… broken.

interviewer: Cathy, I hear how the guilt extends beyond the lab error into a pattern of self-criticism and how the worry about your parents’ health adds another layer of pressure you’re carrying alone. Let me recap: We’ve covered your exhaustion, perfectionism, the lab error triggering self-doubt, sleep disruption, strained marital dynamics, and the quiet dread about your parents’ health that you haven’t shared yet. The ring seems to be a grounding anchor for you. What did I miss?

patient: I think you got the core... maybe the... the way joy feels like a luxury I can’t afford. Gardening, chutney—things that once grounded me now feel... performative. Like I’m faking it. And sometimes I wonder if all this is just... delay. But I don’t want to dwell. The ring helps, really.

interviewer: Cathy, what I’ve heard is that the guilt extends beyond the lab error into a pattern of self-criticism, the quiet dread about your parents’ health you’re carrying alone, and the way joy now feels like a luxury you can’t afford, with activities feeling performative. The ring remains a grounding anchor for you. What did I miss?

patient: You’re not wrong. I guess... I’ve been carrying this silent alert about my parents’ health, like another bug in the system I can’t patch. The ring’s the only thing that feels solid lately—otherwise, I’m just... recalibrating every day.

interviewer: Cathy, I appreciate your honesty about how the ring has become a symbol of stability for you amidst all this uncertainty. Let’s talk about what steps might help you feel more grounded moving forward—what would you like to explore next in our work together?

patient: Honestly? I’ve been thinking about... recalibrating my routines. Like, maybe forcing myself to pause for 10 minutes a day without checking a screen or a list. It sounds trivial, but my mind’s always in 'diagnostic mode'—even my downtime feels like triage. If I could... test small variables, you know? Reintroducing the chutney recipe I abandoned, or actually *tasting* it instead of just... going through the motions. But I’m afraid any progress will just be another algorithm I can’t sustain.

interviewer: Cathy, I appreciate your focus on recalibrating routines and testing small, intentional changes like the chutney recipe. Let me confirm: Our summary includes your exhaustion, guilt over the lab error and perceived perfectionism, sleep disturbance, strained marriage, and the ring as a grounding symbol. You’ve added today that structured pauses and re-engaging with meaningful activities—without performative pressure—might help rebuild stability. What did I miss, or is there anything else you’d like to add before we plan next steps?

patient: There’s... another quiet alert about my parents’ health I haven’t processed yet. I keep silencing it, though. Feels like another bug I can’t patch right now.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of weight right now, and I appreciate your courage in sharing it. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to clarify or address before our next steps?

patient: I think... I’ve been silencing too many alerts. My parents’ health is a file I keep closing before I can open it. The ring helps, but most days I just feel like a system in maintenance mode. Maybe... if I could stop treating everything like an emergency, even the small things. Even the chutney. Maybe that’s the next variable to test.

interviewer: It seems like identifying small adjustments to reduce hypervigilance is a meaningful step for you. Would you like to explore one specific change we could prioritize for next week, or is there another detail we should clarify before we wrap up?

patient: Maybe... the 10-minute pause first. No screens, no lists. Just sit with the chutney instead of rushing through it. If that holds, I’ll... unpack the parents’ file later. Small steps, right? Sounds less like a diagnostic error.

interviewer: It’s clear you’re prioritizing manageable steps to rebuild stability—let’s schedule a follow-up in two weeks to assess how the 10-minute pauses and small routines are working. Before we end, is there anything else you’d like to address today about your next steps or support system?

patient: I think the 10-minute pauses are… tolerable. I tried holding my breath for ten seconds yesterday while making chutney, counted each second in my head. It helped steady my hands, though the recipe still felt like a checklist. My husband says I’m ‘methodical about healing,’ which sounds kind, I guess. I’ll note the follow-up—though I’ll need to double-check my calendar three times to be sure. Thank you for the… structured approach.
