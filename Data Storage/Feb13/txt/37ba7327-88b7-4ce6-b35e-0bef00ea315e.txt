system: Session 37ba7327-88b7-4ce6-b35e-0bef00ea315e transcript

system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Hello Victoria, thank you for coming in today. To start, would you prefer I use a different name or pronouns for you?

patient: No, Victoria's fine. I guess I don't really think about pronouns or anything. Just...Victoria. Most people call me Vic, but that's probably too casual for a place like this.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Victoria. Would you be comfortable proceeding with our discussion today?

patient: Yeah, of course. I just… need to make sure I’m not going to zone out or anything. It’s been a rough few weeks, but I’ll do my best.

interviewer: That sounds challenging. Would you like me to explain how today’s session will proceed?

patient: I guess... it’s up to you. I just don’t want to waste time if my brain’s not going to cooperate. At work, I’ve been catching myself... recalibrating the same machine three times because I can’t tell if it’s ‘right’ anymore. But I’ll try to stay with it.

interviewer: It sounds like focusing has been really difficult lately. Do you have any immediate questions about how we'll be working together today before we move forward?

patient: No, I think you’ve got the plan covered. I’m just… used to following protocols at work. Like, double-checking inventory lists until they ‘align’ properly. It’s weird, though—I can’t even remember the last time I felt fully… present. But I’ll keep notes if that helps.

interviewer: Can you tell me what's been most concerning for you lately and what's prompted you to seek help now?

patient: I guess the main thing is work... I’ve been recalibrating machines way too much. My supervisor mentioned a performance plan. Honestly, I just feel like my battery’s dead most days. And, you know, I messed up the rent payment last month—probably proves I’m losing it.

interviewer: It sounds like feeling drained has been a big part of this. When did you first start noticing these feelings of being mentally or physically exhausted at work and home?

patient: It’s hard to pinpoint an exact time—it just crept up, like a machine losing calibration. Maybe six months? I remember one night I stayed up counting inventory in my head until 2 a.m., and even after sleeping, I woke up feeling like I’d run a marathon. I guess... it’s been a slow drain. Like my battery’s been on 10% for ages, but I keep pretending there’s a charging port somewhere.

interviewer: It sounds like the disrupted sleep has been really draining for you. How often do you find yourself waking up in the middle of the night like that?

patient: It’s...a few times a week, honestly. Feels like my brain’s a glitchy device that needs a reset button. There was this one night I counted inventory in my head until 2 a.m.—again. My roommate still hasn’t stopped asking if I’m ‘cramming for a pop quiz’ when I stare at the ceiling like that. I guess it’s just…how my head short-circuits now?

interviewer: It sounds like these nighttime rituals are really disruptive. How has this been affecting your interactions with others, like your roommate or colleagues?

patient: My roommate teases me about it, says I’m ‘debugging my brain’ or something. I guess it’s… awkward when I’m up all night and then can’t function the next day. At work, I just try to hyperfocus on small tasks to… not think. But I’m sure they notice I’m slower. I mean, I’m probably just being dramatic. Maybe I’m just…seasonally dysfunctional.

interviewer: It sounds like the combination of sleep disruption and work strain is really affecting your confidence and relationships. What would you most like to achieve through this session today?

patient: I guess… I want to figure out how to stop recalibrating everything until it’s ‘perfect’ and actually have energy left to, you know, function. Like, if I could just… troubleshoot why my brain keeps looping the same checks. And maybe not be such a glitchy device that my roommate jokes about needing a reset button. But I’m probably just being dramatic again.

interviewer: It sounds like these loops are really draining for you. Can you tell me a bit about when these patterns first started, especially in relation to your divorce last year?

patient: It’s kind of hard to pin down, but I guess the loops started getting worse around the time everything else collapsed. My ex and I… we were already like a broken machine, just running the same cycle until it short-circuited. After it ended, I kept thinking if I could just 'reset' my routine—wake up at the same time, count inventory thrice, make sure every wire’s connected—it would make the noise in my head stop. But my battery’s been on 10% for months, and I’m still just… waiting for the system to update.

interviewer: It sounds like the divorce might have triggered a significant shift in these patterns. Can you share more about how your daily routine or symptoms changed in the months following the breakup?

patient: I guess after the divorce, the loops just... solidified. Like, I’d recalibrate the same machine six times to avoid thinking about anything else. My sleep? It’s either 4 a.m. counting inventory or passing out face-first on the keyboard. I tried making samosas once—my hands froze, like the motor functions got corrupted. Joke’s on me, right? I’m just... seasonally dysfunctional.

interviewer: It sounds like those moments where your hands freeze—like with the samosas—can be really frustrating and isolating. What have you tried so far to manage these patterns or feelings when they show up?

patient: I guess I mostly just... force myself to keep going? Like, I’ll try to 'power through' the freezing by focusing on something mechanical, like counting inventory until my head stops spinning. But it usually just makes me more stuck. I tried making samosas again once, hoping the routine would help, but my hands just... froze up like the system crashed. To be honest, I’m starting to think I’m one update away from overheating. My roommate says I need a reset button. Joke’s on me, right?

interviewer: It sounds like those moments of your hands freezing up are really frustrating. Can you tell me how long you’ve been experiencing that kind of physical 'freezing' during tasks like cooking or work?

patient: It’s been… months, I guess? Maybe since the divorce? My hands just… lock up sometimes, like the system’s buffering. I tried making samosas again last week, and the dough felt like code I couldn’t compile. My supervisor mentioned my ‘efficiency’ again today—joke’s on them, right? I’m just waiting for the patch to fix the glitch.

interviewer: That sounds like a really frustrating experience, especially when it interferes with things you used to enjoy. What have you tried so far to manage these moments when your hands freeze or when you feel stuck in these loops?

patient: I guess I mostly just... force myself to power through? Like, if my hands freeze, I’ll switch to something mechanical—counting inventory until my head stops spinning. But it usually just makes me more stuck. I tried the samosas again once, hoping the routine would help... but my hands froze like the system crashed. Joke’s on me, I guess. I’m just waiting for the patch to fix the glitch.

interviewer: It sounds like the divorce has been a significant turning point for you. Have you experienced episodes like this before, especially around major life changes, and if so, what helped you manage them?

patient: I... I don’t think I’ve had full-blown episodes before. Life stressors? Sure. My mom’s health scares kept me on hyperdrive for years—counting inventory at 2 a.m. feels like the same loop, but… this time it’s like the system crashed. No reboot button. I just keep… recalibrating the same machine until the numbers lie. It’s not that bad, really. I’m used to being 'seasonally dysfunctional.'

interviewer: That metaphor of recalibrating a machine until the numbers lie suggests a pattern of repetitive behaviors to manage distress. When did you first notice this pattern emerging, and is there someone you typically rely on when these cycles feel overwhelming?

patient: The... loops? They’ve been there since my mom’s health stuff, I guess. It’s just… louder now. As for relying on someone? My mom’s always been my backup, but she’s got her own messes. I don’t want to sound like a broken appliance nagging for service. Honestly, I’m just… waiting for the update patch. It’s not like I’m unplugged forever. Most days, I’m functional. Some days… I’m just waiting for the error message to stop repeating.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight alone, especially with your mom's situation. How have you typically handled moments when you feel like you're 'waiting for the error message to stop repeating' in the past?

patient: I guess I just... tinker with the system until it holds. Like, if I focus on fixing the machine, the rest of the noise fades. It’s not much, but it’s enough to keep the battery from dying completely. I mean, I’m not exactly a tech support nightmare, right? Most days, I just... reset the loop. Over and over.

interviewer: That sounds like a fragile balance you're maintaining. When those loops feel unmanageable or the 'noise' becomes too loud, how do you typically reach out for support—or what stops you from doing so?

patient: I... I usually just power through it. Like, if I hyperfocus on the machines, the rest fades. My mom’s there, but she’s got her own... alerts. I don’t want to be another one. It’s not like I’m a singleton system or anything. But most days, I just... wait for the signal to noise ratio to balance.

interviewer: It sounds like your mom’s health has shaped how you approach stress and support. Can you share how your relationship with her has influenced your ability to ask for help during these cycles?

patient: I guess... if my mom’s a nurse who’s always fixing things, I learned early that asking for help means you’re broken. Like, if the machine’s glitching, you fix it yourself or it’s a 'tech support nightmare.' But she’s got her own health alerts now, so I don’t want to be another... error code she has to troubleshoot. It’s just easier to keep recalibrating the same loop. Not like I’d know how to 'diagnose' myself anyway.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to manage everything independently has been really isolating. Have you experienced similar patterns of relying on self-regulation during past stressors, and if so, what strategies, if any, helped you feel more stable at the time?

patient: I guess... I tend to over-check things? Like, when I’m setting up equipment, I’ll recalibrate it three times just to be sure. It’s part of the job, right? But it’s not really a strategy—it’s more like... I don’t want to be the one who messed up. Again.

interviewer: It seems like your mom’s role as a nurse shaped how you view stress and self-reliance. Can you tell me a bit about your mom’s health history and how that might have influenced your approach to responsibility and perfectionism?

patient: I guess my mom’s always had this... rigid way of doing things. She’d fix a problem and that was that—no second-guessing. It’s kind of stuck with me, I guess. At work, if I don’t double-check the machines, I feel like something’s gonna blow up. Not literally, obviously. But... it’s just a habit. Maybe? I don’t know. She never talked about stress, just ‘did your job or you failed.’ So I guess I learned to... not ask for help unless the machine’s actually on fire.

interviewer: It sounds like your relationship with your mom has deeply shaped how you manage stress and self-criticism. Have you experienced similar episodes of distress in the past, especially around major life changes, and if so, what strategies helped you cope?

patient: I guess... when things get too much, I just... hyperfocus on work stuff. Like, if I’m stressing about something, I’ll start recalibrating machines until they’re ‘perfect.’ It’s not really a strategy, though. It’s more like... a distraction. Keeps my hands busy so I don’t have to think. But it doesn’t really help, honestly. I just... don’t know what else to do.

interviewer: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle where work becomes both a refuge and a source of strain. Have you noticed any moments when reaching out to others, even in small ways, helped break this cycle or reduce the pressure you feel to fix everything alone?

patient: I guess... once, I asked a coworker about a machine. But it’s easier to just... recalibrate myself. Even then, it’s not like it fixed anything. More like a temporary patch. My battery’s still at 10%, though, so... maybe I’ll try again someday.

interviewer: It takes courage to reach out even in small ways. How did that experience with your coworker make you feel afterward?

patient: It felt... temporary. Like applying a bandage to a short circuit. Didn’t stop the hum, just... quieted it for a bit. Then I went back to checking the machines. Again.

interviewer: That sounds really difficult to carry alone. Have you been having thoughts about ending your life?

patient: I guess... sometimes I wonder if I could just... power down for a while. Not really plan anything, though. It’s more like the thought lingers in the background, like static. I’m just... stuck in low battery mode, you know? Probably being dramatic again.

interviewer: It sounds like these thoughts are persistent but not currently tied to a plan. Have you ever considered a specific way or method for acting on these thoughts?

patient: No, I—I don’t think I’ve ever... you know. It’s more like a background hum, right? Like if I even tried, I’d probably botch it. My brain’s already terrible at following through on anything. Even staying in bed past noon feels like a risk, but I guess that’s not exactly... actionable. I’m just not good at making plans for anything, really. Even the bad ones.

interviewer: It sounds like these thoughts are persistent but not currently tied to a plan. What are some things that have kept you from acting on those thoughts, even in moments when they feel strongest?

patient: I guess... the thought of letting people down? My mom, maybe. Or... I don’t know, the effort it would take to even figure it out feels impossible. Like, if I can’t remember how to set my alarm properly most days, how would I even... you know. And sometimes I think about how my roommate would just *sigh* forever if something happened. It’s stupid, but the idea of adding that to the noise? My brain’s already bad at prioritizing anything, even the bad stuff.

interviewer: It sounds like the effort required to act on those thoughts feels overwhelming. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or how much sleep you need lately?

patient: I guess my sleep’s been... off. Like, I wake up a lot at night, even when I’m exhausted. And during the day, I feel like a machine that’s not charging properly—slow, but I force myself through tasks. My shifts at work? I’ll catch myself recalibrating the same machine three times because my brain’s stuck on ‘error check.’ It’s just... inefficient, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like your energy levels are really affecting your work and daily life. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energized or need very little sleep, even when you're tired?

patient: No, I don’t think so. My body’s more like a machine that’s stuck in ‘low power mode’—it just grinds through without really... revving up. Sometimes I wish it would just *overclock* so I could get everything done faster, but no luck. I guess I’m just... inefficient.

interviewer: I understand that feeling stuck in low power mode is really draining. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol, cannabis, or other substance use recently, or are you currently taking any medications or supplements that might affect your energy or mood?

patient: Honestly? I’ve been drinking more coffee than usual—like, borderline bitter enough to taste like I’m punishing myself. But other than that… I guess I’m still taking the prenatal vitamins my ex left behind. Keeps me… grounded? I don’t know. They’re probably expired by now. (Pauses, then softens with a wry smile.) My boss keeps asking if I need a nap break. I just tell her I’m ‘seasonally dysfunctional.’ Sounds less alarming than ‘broken.’

interviewer: It sounds like coffee is a big part of your routine now. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol use recently, or been using more or less than usual?

patient: Honestly? I’ve been trying to cut back on wine since my coworker joked I ‘need a designated wine opener’ for my keychain. But… I’m pretty sure I just replaced one habit with another. (Pauses, then shrugs.) Coffee’s my real problem, though. My mug’s practically a permanent fixture. (Softly) It’s not like I’m… celebrating anything these days. Work’s chaos is the only thing that makes the low battery warning feel less urgent.

interviewer: It sounds like coffee has become a central part of your routine. Are you currently using any other medications, supplements, or substances that might affect your mood or energy levels?

patient: Just the vitamins, I think? They’re… a relic, honestly. My ex’s leftover nurse stuff. I don’t even know if they’re doing anything besides making me feel like I’m ‘pretending to be functional.’ (Soft laugh.) No, I’m not adding anything else to the chaos. Coffee’s bad enough.

interviewer: It sounds like the vitamins aren't providing much support. Have you noticed any experiences where you hear voices, see things others don't, or have thoughts that feel unusual or paranoid?

patient: No, I don’t hear voices or see things… probably. Sometimes I catch myself thinking someone’s following me on my commute, but I chalk it up to being ‘overly dramatic.’ (Pauses, then adds softly) The static in my head feels real enough, though. Like… background noise that won’t shut off. (Wry smile) But that’s just me, right? Everyone’s a little paranoid when they’re sleep-deprived.

interviewer: It sounds like the static and paranoia are distressing even if you dismiss them. How often do these thoughts about being followed or the static occur, and do they feel true to you even when you try to rationalize them away?

patient: The static’s pretty much always there, like a machine running in the background. I tell myself it’s just caffeine or sleep deprivation, but… it’s the kind of noise you can’t quite tune out. (Softly) My brain’s just glitchy, I guess. Everyone’s got their thing, right?

interviewer: Vic, from what we’ve discussed, it sounds like your symptoms started around six months ago, got worse after the divorce, and now you're struggling with sleep, focus at work, and feeling like you're running on low battery. You mentioned using routines and checking things repeatedly to cope, but it's making you more tired. There's also this background thought of wanting to power down, though you don't have a plan for that. I'm wondering if I missed anything important here?

patient: I guess that’s… mostly it. The routines, they’re like a firewall, but the system’s still glitching. I keep chugging coffee like it’s a performance metric, and the vitamins my roommate left—iron, I think?—taste like I’m faking it. But yeah, the static’s always there. Just… same old radio snow. You ever notice how silence feels heavier when you’re trying to power through it?

interviewer: What did I miss about how these routines and coping strategies fit into your daily life or how they might be helping or straining you in ways we haven’t discussed?

patient: Oh. The sketchbook I never open? It’s just another thing I tell myself I’ll get to when I’m ‘fixed.’ But the truth is, I’m too drained to even think about it. The coffee helps me function, but it’s like… running a machine on fumes. Eventually, it just stalls.

interviewer: It sounds like the sketchbook symbolizes a part of yourself that’s been put on hold, and the coffee is a temporary fix that’s starting to backfire. What would you like to focus on first as we work together to address these patterns—like exploring strategies to rebuild creative engagement, addressing the sleep-cycle disruptions, or something else?

patient: I think… the sketchbook’s just another thing I’m ‘supposed’ to care about. Like, if I could just find the right app for creativity, it’d sync back up? But the coffee—yeah, I’m starting to think it’s just… noise. White noise. My brain’s so used to the static, it doesn’t know what ‘quiet’ feels like anymore. Maybe… maybe we could look at why I’m so afraid of the quiet? Or is that just more looping?

interviewer: It seems the fear of quiet and looping thoughts are significant for you right now. Before we move forward, is there anything else you'd like to add about how these patterns show up in your life or what might be missing from our discussion so far?

patient: Oh. The $150 late fee? I guess that’s just another system update I didn’t get a manual for. My mom would’ve called it ‘falling apart’… but I’m more worried it’s just another loop I can’t escape. The rest? I think we’ve parsed the error logs enough. Let’s… let’s see if the firewall can hold a little longer.

interviewer: It sounds like the late fee and these system metaphors highlight how you’re navigating life’s pressures through structured coping, even when it feels unsatisfying. Let’s review: we’ve covered your struggles with sleep, focus, work performance, and the passive wish to ‘power down’—all linked to the divorce and patterns of self-reliance. What would you like to prioritize next in our work together—exploring therapy, considering medical support, or adjusting daily routines?

patient: I guess… I don’t want to overcomplicate it yet. Maybe start with the firewall—tweak the routines to stop them from draining the battery. But honestly? I’m not sure if it’s about adding new apps or just… better maintenance. The sketchbook’s still in the ‘update pending’ queue. Let’s see if the system can handle a patch first.

interviewer: It sounds like refining existing routines as a 'firewall' to preserve energy is a priority right now, while the sketchbook and 'system updates' remain in limbo. What did I miss about how these patterns connect to your needs or fears?

patient: I guess... the routines are like a firewall to keep the static from overwhelming me. The sketchbook... it’s a system I can’t update. If I open it, I might crash completely. But maybe that’s just another loop I can’t escape.

interviewer: It sounds like the firewall of routines is both a shield and a drain, while the sketchbook represents a part of yourself that feels too fragile to access. Let me recap: we’ve explored how sleep disruption, work strain, and passive hopelessness are linked to your divorce and self-reliance patterns. The routines and tech metaphors reflect your effort to manage overwhelm, but they’re backfiring by draining energy. What did I miss about how these themes connect to your needs or fears?

patient: I think... the firewall thing is just my way of pretending I’m in control. Like, if I keep recalibrating the machines, maybe I won’t notice how everything else is glitching. The sketchbook—it’s not just creativity, right? It’s this... part of me that used to feel whole. Now it’s just another thing I’m scared to open because if it crashes, Mom’ll hear about it. I’m not even sure she’d get the metaphor, but the disappointment? That’s a real loop I can’t reset.

interviewer: It sounds like these thoughts can feel really heavy, especially when you're already managing so much. Can you share with me what warning signs might indicate your thoughts are becoming more concerning, and what steps you take to cope when you notice those signs?

patient: If I start not being able to power through the routines... like, if I can’t even recalibrate the machines without freezing up? That’s a red flag. I’ll start chugging more coffee and pretending the static isn’t louder. But if the battery drops below 5%? I... I text my roommate to remind me to pay the rent. It’s not much, but it’s a firewall against the worst-case scenario log.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve developed some strategies to manage when things feel overwhelming. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or clarify for next steps?

patient: I think... I’ll keep tinkering with the firewall for now. Maybe eventually I’ll find the update notes for the sketchbook, but priority’s on keeping the machines running. If the static gets louder, I’ll... figure it out.

interviewer: It sounds like you're doing your best to keep things stable even when it's hard. If the static becomes too loud or the firewall feels weaker, who might you reach out to, and what might help in that moment?

patient: I guess I’d... call my roommate. Not for anything big, just like, a reminder to pay the rent or something. It’s not much, but it’s a way to keep the battery from dying. I just don’t want to... add noise to their lives, you know? They’ve got their own stuff to fix.

interviewer: It sounds like reaching out to your roommate, even in small ways, is a meaningful way to stay connected when things feel heavy. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to clarify or prioritize for next steps?

patient: I guess... I’ve been trying to keep the inventory system running smoothly at work. It helps me focus, I suppose. And, uh... maybe I’ll try to... you know, charge my battery a bit more. No big plans, though. Just... keeping the systems online, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like focusing on small, manageable steps like charging your battery and maintaining systems feels grounding for you. Before we close, would you like to identify one specific self-care strategy you could try this week to support that balance?

patient: Maybe... I’ll try setting a timer for 15 minutes each evening to just sit without scrolling or... recalibrating anything. Let the battery ‘rest’ instead of draining it to zero again. It’s... not much, but it feels like a system update I can actually run without crashing.

interviewer: That’s a thoughtful approach to giving yourself space without overloading. Before we close, could you share your current plan for managing warning signs—like if the static gets louder—and who you might reach out to in those moments?

patient: If the static starts... I guess I’ll try powering down earlier, like resetting the system before it crashes. Maybe text my roommate if I’m stuck in a loop past midnight—she jokes about my ‘robot mode’ but... I think she’d notice if I stop sending the usual updates. The sketchbook’s there as a backup, but I’ll need to charge it first, I guess.
