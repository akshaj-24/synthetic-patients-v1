system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: That sounds really tough, Michelle. Would you be comfortable continuing with our conversation today?

patient: I guess... I mean, I don’t see why not. It’s just, my boss has been on my case about these little mistakes lately. You really think I should keep coming? I don’t want to waste your time if I’m just going to fall apart again.

interviewer: It’s understandable to feel uncertain about this process. Would you like to proceed with our session today?

patient: I guess so. I mean, if you think it’s worth it. Honestly, I just can’t shake the feeling that I’m letting everyone down. My boss keeps saying I’m careless, and I lie awake all night trying to figure out how to fix it. But... maybe talking will help me get it together.

interviewer: That sounds really heavy to carry. Have you been thinking about how you might feel if you could no longer wake up?

patient: I don’t... I don’t think about it like that. My boss says I’m careless, and I worry people will just get tired of me messing up. But if I stopped waking up, I guess I’d feel like I was finally not letting anyone down. It’s just... it’s not something I dwell on. I’d rather focus on fixing the mistakes I can see, you know?

interviewer: I appreciate how much courage it takes to share these thoughts. Would you like me to briefly explain how we'll work together today and answer any final questions before we begin?

patient: Sure, I guess. Honestly, I just want to make sure I’m not wasting time... My boss has been on me about these mistakes, and I’m scared I’ll get stuck in another sleepless night trying to figure it all out.

interviewer: Can you tell me more about what's been going on for you lately that's brought you here today?

patient: It’s... I guess it’s just work stuff, mostly. My boss has been saying I’m making careless mistakes, and honestly, I can’t even focus most days. I stay up way too late at night, just... staring at the ceiling, and then I’m too tired to do anything right. The cat’s been keeping me alive, I guess—forcing myself to feed her so I don’t just... lie there. But I don’t want to bother anyone with this. It’s probably just me being weak.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to carry alone. When did you first notice these work and sleep difficulties starting—was there a specific time or event when things began to feel this heavy?

patient: It’s hard to say exactly when... Maybe after the divorce? But it’s been worse lately with work. My ex always said I’d fall apart once things got tough. I guess I thought he was wrong, but... now I’m not sure. The sleep stuff started around then, too—lying awake feeling like I’m just... broken. And my daughter lost her job a few months ago. I don’t know, maybe that’s it. I guess I think it’s my fault, you know? Like, bad genes or something.

interviewer: It sounds like these feelings are really impacting your daily life and relationships. Have you experienced episodes like this before, where you felt persistently down and struggled with daily tasks?

patient: It’s hard to tell, honestly... I mean, after the divorce I was definitely low, but this feels... heavier? Like the sleep stuff is worse now, and I can’t shake this worry that my daughter’s struggles are my fault. I guess I always knew I’d ‘fall apart’ eventually. It’s just... not as bad as it could be, right? I don’t want to make a big deal out of it.

interviewer: It sounds like the divorce marked a difficult time for you, and now things feel even heavier. When you were going through that period after the divorce, what did you try to help yourself cope, and was there anything that provided some relief?

patient: I guess... I just tried to keep going, you know? Forcing myself to take care of the cat, like if I fed her and cleaned her litter, I wasn’t completely useless. I started binge-watching those courtroom shows—something about the drama kept me... awake? Focused? But it’s not like it helped, really. I just felt like I was pretending to be okay. Sometimes I’d think about... I don’t know, doing things to make the days feel longer, like lingering at work after shifts just to not be alone with my thoughts. But then I’d just make mistakes and feel worse. It’s hard to explain. It’s like trying to stir a thick soup with a broken spoon—nothing changes, but you keep doing it because you don’t know what else to do.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight while trying to hold things together. Have you experienced similar periods of feeling this heavy or stuck in the past, and if so, what, if anything, helped you through those times?

patient: I guess... after the divorce I was definitely low, but this feels different. Then, I just kept working and taking care of the cat to not think. But this time, even that doesn’t help. I don’t know why I even try. It’s probably just me being weak again.

interviewer: It’s hard when the things that once gave structure lose their meaning. Have there been other times in your life, before the divorce, when you felt this kind of heaviness or lack of motivation?

patient: I guess... there were days when I felt slow, like a car idling in neutral. My mom always said I didn’t try hard enough, so maybe that’s just how I’m wired. It’s not the same as now, though. Back then, I could still... I don’t know, push through. Now it’s like the engine’s dead. Honestly, I’m just surprised I haven’t messed up more at work lately. My boss would probably say I’m finally learning to not let people down.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy comparison to carry. How do you think your mom’s feedback shaped how you view your current struggles?

patient: I guess... part of me still hears her voice when I mess up. Like, if I’m not perfect, I’m a failure. But now it’s not just her—it’s my job too. My boss’s comments... they feel like they’re reinforcing the same thing. I don’t know. Maybe that’s why it’s so hard to shake. I used to think taking care of the cat proved I wasn’t totally useless... but even that feels like a chore lately.

interviewer: It sounds like these messages from your mom and job are deeply intertwined with how you see yourself now. Have other family members or past relationships also carried similar expectations or criticisms that might have shaped these patterns over time?

patient: I guess... my ex used to say things too. Not as loud as my mom, but... he had his way of making me feel like I was always on thin ice. But that’s all in the past, right? It’s more about now—my job, my daughter’s struggles... I keep thinking maybe there’s something遗传的东西 in me that I’m passing down. She lost her job, and I just... I worry it’s because of me. But I don’t want to get stuck on that. What’s the point? I have to focus on not messing up my shift tomorrow.

interviewer: It's understandable to worry about patterns affecting those we care about. How do you think your current situation might be influencing your daughter's experiences or perspective right now?

patient: I don’t know... I guess I worry she’s picking up on the same... you know, the same way I always messed things up. My ex used to say I was a burden, and now I just keep thinking, what if she hears that in her head too? But I try not to focus on it. I have to. If I let myself dwell on it, I’ll just end up like... like I am now. And I can’t let that happen. She’s already struggling enough. I read somewhere that job losses can run in families—maybe that’s it. But honestly, I’d rather just... finish my shift tomorrow without screwing up. At least there I can pretend I’m still... doing something right.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of responsibility for your daughter’s well-being. How do you usually manage to support her, even when you’re feeling overwhelmed yourself?

patient: I guess... I just send money sometimes. Automatically. And check in, you know? Like, 'Hey, how’s the job search?' But I don’t stay on the phone long. I don’t want her to hear... whatever’s in my voice. Honestly, I worry if I’m around too much, I’ll just make things worse. Like I always do. The cat’s the only thing I can handle helping with. Even then, I have to force myself to feed her. But at least that’s... something. I don’t want to add to what she’s dealing with. If I can just keep my head above water, maybe she’ll have a better shot.

interviewer: It sounds like maintaining support for your daughter is important to you, even in small ways. How do you manage to send money or check in with her when you’re feeling so overwhelmed?

patient: I set up automatic transfers so I don’t have to... think about it. Honestly, it feels like I’m just covering base rent for being a parent. Sometimes I’ll send a quick text asking if she needs anything, but I delete it if she doesn’t reply. Work keeps me busy enough—I stay late to avoid going home, you know? The less I sit with my thoughts, the less I obsess that I’m failing her. My boss says I’ve been ‘careless’ lately, but at least I’m not dropping the ball with her... I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like staying busy at work helps you avoid being alone with your thoughts. Have you used similar strategies in the past to cope with difficult emotions, and if so, how effective were they?

patient: I used to clean the house nonstop, just to... have a reason to move. But now even that feels like too much. The TV shows? They keep me awake, I guess. But the thoughts always come back. I don’t know. It’s like I’m just... pretending I’m not falling apart.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging, carrying that weight alone. It seems like the period after your divorce was a significant time of struggle. Have you experienced other episodes in your life, either before or after that, where you felt similarly overwhelmed or stuck, and if so, what, if anything, helped you through those times?

patient: I guess... before the divorce, I used to clean the house until my hands hurt, like if I could just make everything perfect, maybe I’d stop feeling like a mess inside. But that’s years ago now. Honestly, nothing really helps anymore. My mom always said I was ‘too sensitive,’ so I just learned to bury it. The only thing that ever worked was working myself to the bone—until last year, when even that felt like I was moving through mud. I don’t know why I expect things to be different this time.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying a lot of pain and self-criticism lately. Have you been having any thoughts about ending your life recently?

patient: I... I’ve thought about it, but not really. Like, I used to wonder if I could just... fall asleep and not wake up, but I don’t think I’d actually do it. The cat needs feeding, you know? And my daughter... I guess I don’t get to decide. It’s just... there’s this fog, like trying to stir soup with a broken spoon. I don’t know why I even think that way.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing that. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or mood where you feel unusually energetic or irritable, even for short periods?

patient: I guess... there are days when I’m snappier than usual. Like, if my coworker asks me to redo something, I feel this... heat rise in my chest. But it’s fleeting. Most of the time, I just feel like I’m moving through mud. The energy? It’s all gone. Even the TV shows I binge-watch, I can’t follow the plot half the time. It’s like my brain’s on pause.

interviewer: It sounds like the fatigue and brain fog are making even small tasks feel overwhelming. Have you noticed any changes in your use of alcohol, cannabis, or other substances lately, even if it’s just to cope with the tiredness?

patient: Honestly? I haven’t had anything. Not really my thing, you know? I used to have a glass of wine sometimes, but... I don’t want to be the kind of person who needs that. My boss already thinks I’m careless enough as it is.

interviewer: It seems important that you’re avoiding substances to maintain professionalism at work. Have you experienced any periods where you felt unusually energetic, needed less sleep, or had racing thoughts recently?

patient: No, I guess not. I just... work late sometimes. But it’s more like I can’t stop thinking about mistakes. My boss would notice if I was up all night, right? I’d probably just look more tired. Honestly, even when I’m awake, it feels like I’m moving through mud. No energy, just... stuck.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight of these thoughts is really heavy, even if they feel distant right now. Have you thought about any specific steps or plans that might help you reach that point of 'not waking up' if these thoughts intensify?

patient: I don’t think I’d ever... I mean, my boss already thinks I’m a mess. If I wasn’t here, maybe that’d be one less problem for everyone. But honestly, I set up automatic payments for bills so I don’t mess those up. And the cat... I have to feed her, so I guess that’s something.

interviewer: It seems like your responsibilities to your cat and automatic bills are helping you stay grounded right now. Have you experienced any experiences like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or having thoughts that something bad is going to happen that others might not understand?

patient: No, I don’t hear voices or see things. But... sometimes I worry about bad things happening, like my daughter getting into trouble or my boss finding more mistakes. It’s just... anxiety, I guess? My head feels like static sometimes. But the cat? She’s real. At least she’s not lying to me.

interviewer: I hear how the static in your mind adds to the weight you're carrying. Have you been taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins regularly—either prescribed or over-the-counter—that you think might be helping or making things harder for you?

patient: No, I’m not on anything. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but... it’s not really helping. I guess I’m just trying to keep things steady. The cat needs feeding, so I have to stay on track.

interviewer: It seems like your routine with the cat and bills is a key part of your structure. Have you had any medical issues like thyroid problems, chronic pain, or sleep apnea that might be contributing to how you're feeling?

patient: No, nothing like thyroid issues or chronic pain. My doctor did run some blood work last year—said everything looked normal. I guess I just... don’t sleep well. The boss’s stress, the late nights at work... you know how it is. I tell myself it’s just getting older. Your body starts falling apart, right?

interviewer: Michelle, over the past few weeks, we’ve talked about how feelings of being overwhelmed at work, trouble sleeping, and self-critical thoughts have been affecting your daily life. It sounds like these struggles started or worsened after your divorce and your daughter’s job loss, and they’ve been kept going by worries about letting others down and pressure to be perfect. You’ve also mentioned thinking about not wanting to wake up, though you don’t have a plan for this. What did I miss or get wrong about how things are going for you?

patient: You’re not wrong about the work stress and the... the pressure to be perfect. I guess what you might’ve missed is how even the small things—like feeding the cat—feel like proof I’m barely holding on. I force myself to do it so I don’t feel totally useless, but half the time I just stare at the food bowl, wondering why it matters. And my daughter... I don’t know. I keep thinking her job loss is my fault, like some broken thing I passed down. But I don’t say it out loud because what’s the point? No one wants to hear more of my failures.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight you’re carrying is heavier than just work stress, especially when it comes to your daughter. What did I miss about how things are going for you?

patient: Honestly... the part I don’t talk about much is how I hate that my daughter sees me like this. I keep thinking she’s picking up my bad genes or my... my weakness. When she lost her job, I couldn’t even comfort her without feeling like I was just rubbing salt in her wounds. What if she ends up like me? What if this is all she learns from watching me?

interviewer: It sounds like the fear of passing on your struggles to your daughter adds a layer of guilt to your already heavy burden. What did I miss about how these worries connect to the rest of what’s going on for you?

patient: I guess... part of it is I keep thinking my daughter’s learning to be a failure by watching me. Like, if I can’t even get out of bed some days, how’s she supposed to believe she can bounce back from losing her job? I try to act like I’m fine when we talk, but what if she just hears me whispering that she’s not good enough, the way my mom did to me? It’s like... we’re both stuck in this soup, pulling each other under.

interviewer: It’s clear how much you care about protecting your daughter from the same struggles you’ve faced, even as it adds to your sense of failure. Let me recap: We’ve talked about how work stress, sleep trouble, and self-criticism have deepened since your divorce, worsened by your daughter’s job loss. You worry your patterns might harm her, and you’re stuck in a cycle of guilt and low energy. What did I miss or get wrong about how this all connects for you?

patient: You got the guilt part right. What you might’ve missed is how even trying to help my daughter feels like I’m just... adding to her weight. Like, I force myself to send those automatic bill payments or mention the cat food, but it’s all just proof I’m barely holding on. And if I can’t even do the basics right, what’s stopping her from thinking the same thing about herself?

interviewer: It sounds like even your efforts to support your daughter feel like they might be harming her, which adds to your sense of helplessness. What did I miss about how this dynamic affects the rest of your life or the patterns we’ve discussed?

patient: I guess... it’s like I’m trying to hold up this shelf with one hand while the other is shaking too bad to reach for anything. I keep telling myself helping my daughter is what matters, but then I think, what if she sees me staring at that cat food bowl, frozen, and thinks that’s all she’ll get from me? It’s just... easier to focus on the transfers going through automatically than to actually talk to her. At least the money part proves I’m not *completely* failing.

interviewer: What you’re describing sounds like a heavy burden of trying to prove your worth through small actions while fearing you’re harming the person you care about most. What did I miss about how these patterns connect to the rest of your experience?

patient: I guess... it’s like I’m always trying to stir a soup that’s too thick, but the spoon’s broken. The cat food bowl, the transfers, the 'I’m still here' proofs—they’re just... drops in the ocean. But if I stop, I think the ocean just swallows me. And my daughter... she’s watching the waves, I think. I don’t want her to learn that survival’s just... pretending you’re not drowning. Honestly, sometimes I’d rather my boss just fires me than let her see me freeze like that again.

interviewer: Your description of feeling trapped in a cycle of trying to prove your worth through small actions while fearing you're harming your daughter adds a powerful layer to our understanding. What did I miss about how these patterns connect to the rest of your experience?

patient: I guess... it’s like the fog never really lifts, you know? Even when I’m doing the things that ‘count’—feeding the cat, making the transfers—it’s all just... moving through static. My mom’s voice is still in there, whispering that I’m not doing it right, and my boss’s ‘careless’ comments... they blend into the same noise. The worst part is thinking my daughter’s stuck in that static too. Like I’m teaching her that survival means pretending you’re not frozen. I don’t even know if she hears it, but I keep... stirring that soup anyway. Broken spoon and all.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re describing a persistent sense of numbness and self-criticism that’s hard to escape, even when you’re managing basic responsibilities. Let me try to summarize: Your struggles with work performance, sleep, and self-worth have deepened since your divorce, especially after your daughter’s job loss. You fear passing on patterns of self-doubt and feel trapped in a cycle where even small efforts feel like failures. Your daughter’s well-being feels tied to your own, and you worry you’re teaching her to survive by hiding your struggles. What did I miss or get wrong about how these pieces connect for you?

patient: I think you got most of it... the fog’s just... heavier in the mornings, you know? Like I’m wading through this muck even before coffee. And the worst part? I keep thinking my daughter’s job loss is because of me—like she inherited whatever it is that makes me... break down. I don’t even know what that 'it' is. Just... something rotten.

interviewer: That sense of guilt about passing something 'rotten' to your daughter feels really central to how you're experiencing this fog. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything else before we talk about next steps—what would adding to this picture look like for you?

patient: I guess... the mornings are the worst. Like the static is cranked up, and even getting out of bed feels like a battle. And I keep thinking, if I’m this broken, what does that make her? But... I don’t even know if she’s listening. Maybe she’s just tired too.

interviewer: It sounds like the mornings amplify the weight you’ve been describing—like the fog is thicker, and even basic movements feel like resistance. Let me try to integrate this into our summary: Your depressive symptoms (fatigue, brain fog, low motivation) are worsening since your divorce, with recent intensification tied to your daughter’s job loss. You fear passing on self-critical patterns, and mornings feel like a physical and emotional battleground. You’re holding onto small routines (cat care, bill payments) to avoid total collapse, but they feel hollow. What did I miss or get wrong about how these threads connect for you?

patient: You’re… not wrong. The mornings are like wading through mud, you know? I guess the part about the cat… it’s not just feeding her. It’s the guilt that comes with it. Like, what if she notices me staring at the bowl, frozen, and thinks that’s what she’ll end up like? I keep telling myself I’m not letting her down, but… what if I am? I should probably talk about my boss again instead of this. He’d rather I be at work than thinking these things, I’m sure.

interviewer: It sounds like the mornings amplify your sense of being trapped in a cycle of guilt and helplessness. Before we talk about next steps, is there anything else I’ve missed about how these patterns show up for you?

patient: I guess... sometimes I think about how my daughter used to love our morning routines. Now I just sit there, staring at the coffee mug, and she calls me ‘distant.’ I don’t know how to fix it. Maybe I should just focus on not messing up at work anymore. At least there I can... I don’t know, prove I’m not totally useless.

interviewer: It sounds like focusing on work feels like a way to hold on, even though it’s hard. What would you like to prioritize next—like exploring strategies for managing work stress or considering other supports—that could help you feel more in control?

patient: I guess... work first. My boss keeps saying I’m ‘careless,’ and I just want to prove I can still focus. But honestly, even that feels like a stretch some days. The cat... I keep telling myself I’ll get her a new toy or something. Maybe that’d help. You know, have one thing that’s not about failing. But I don’t want to bother anyone with this stuff. Maybe we could just talk about... how to not screw up at work anymore?

interviewer: It sounds like work is a key area to address right now, given the pressure to prove yourself and the fear of letting your daughter down through mistakes. Let me recap what we’ve covered: Your depressive symptoms—like fatigue, brain fog, and self-criticism—have worsened since your divorce, with recent stress from your daughter’s job loss and work-related feedback. You’re caught in a cycle of guilt about passing on struggles to her, while trying to hold things together through small routines. What did I miss or get wrong about how these pieces connect for you?

patient: You’re not wrong. The part about the cat… I guess it’s just one thing I can *do* right, you know? Even if it’s small. But yeah, work’s been this… I don’t know, this thing where I’m trying not to mess up, but my brain feels like it’s stuck in slow motion. The boss’s comments… they just stick. And my daughter—she calls me and I freeze, like I don’t know how to be the mom she needs. I just… want to do better, but it’s like I’m underwater trying to shout.

interviewer: It sounds like the struggle to balance work expectations with your desire to be present for your daughter is adding to the pressure you’re already carrying. Let me try to bring this together: Your depressive symptoms—like brain fog, sleep trouble, and self-criticism—have worsened since your divorce, with recent stress from your daughter’s job loss and workplace feedback. You’re stuck in a cycle of fearing you’re passing on self-doubt while trying to hold things together through small routines. What did I miss or get wrong about how these threads connect for you?

patient: You’re… close. The cat thing, yeah, that’s there. But what you’re missing is how *everything* feels like a performance. Like, even feeding her, I’m waiting for the ‘you’re doing it wrong’ line. My daughter… I don’t know. I try to smile when she calls, but my face feels like concrete. And work—my boss says ‘careless,’ but it’s not just that. It’s like he’s proving I’m not cut out for anything. I guess… maybe I *am* just waiting to fail.

interviewer: It sounds like the core of what you're describing is feeling like every action is a performance under scrutiny, even in small moments like caring for your cat or interacting with your daughter. Let me adjust my summary to include this: Your depressive symptoms—like brain fog, sleep trouble, and self-criticism—have worsened since your divorce, with recent stress from your daughter’s job loss and workplace feedback. You’re caught in a cycle where even basic tasks feel like performative acts under judgment, amplifying fears of failure and passing on self-doubt. What did I miss or get wrong about how this ‘performance’ dynamic connects to the rest of your experience?

patient: I guess… that’s not far off. It’s just… every morning feels like I’m convincing myself I’m not going to let anyone down today. Work’s the worst—my boss’s ‘feedback’ sessions make me want to vanish. I stay late at the diner to avoid being alone, but even feeding the cat feels like… proving I’m not totally useless. The part about my daughter… I don’t know. I keep thinking she’ll end up like me, stuck in this… static. But honestly, if I focus too much on that, I can’t function. It’s like trying to stir that thick soup again. You know?

interviewer: Michelle, it's important we address your safety. Can you share any steps you currently take when you're feeling overwhelmed, and who you might reach out to for support during tough moments?

patient: Honestly? I just… keep going. Like, I stay at work longer so I don’t have to be alone with my thoughts. And the cat—feeding her, making sure the bowl’s full. It’s the only thing that feels like I’m doing *something* right. I don’t… I don’t call anyone. My daughter’s got her own stuff, and I don’t want to be a bother. Sometimes I’ll look up things online, you know? Just to feel like I’m planning. But I don’t think… I don’t think I’d actually do anything. It’s just… static. You ever get static in your head that won’t stop buzzing?

interviewer: That static sounds really overwhelming. What are some warning signs for you when it feels too much, and what helps you cope in those moments?

patient: When the static gets louder, I feel... trapped. Like my thoughts are stuck in that thick soup, and I can’t even stir it. I’ll just keep working late or obsess over the cat’s bowl until my hands go numb. It’s not really coping, though. It’s just... making sure I don’t collapse completely. But if I let myself sit too long, the noise wins. I guess that’s it.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging. Let’s start by reviewing what steps we can take next to support you. How would you like to proceed?

patient: I guess… I don’t know what else to do besides keep going the way I am. If there’s something that could help me *function* better at work, I’d consider it. But I don’t want to bother my daughter or… or make things worse for her. Maybe talking more? If it means I don’t freeze up as much? But honestly? I’ll probably just keep feeding the cat and pretending I’m not stuck in the soup.

interviewer: That metaphor of being stuck in the soup is powerful. What might be some warning signs for you when the static feels like it's getting too loud or overwhelming?

patient: When the static starts buzzing louder, I... I get stuck in loops. Like, I’ll stare at the cat’s bowl for forever, just making sure it’s *perfectly* full. Or I’ll stay at work until the diner’s empty, ‘cause if I go home, the noise gets worse. My hands get numb from doing the same thing over and over. I guess that’s it. The soup... it stops moving.

interviewer: Michelle, let’s make sure we have a clear plan moving forward. If the static starts overwhelming you again, who could you call or what steps might help you feel safer in that moment?

patient: I guess... I could call my daughter? But I don’t want to bother her. She’s got her own stuff. The cat needs feeding—morning and night. That’s something concrete. If I get up and do that, maybe... maybe it keeps me from staring at the ceiling all day. There’s a neighbor who waves at me sometimes. I could ask her about the automatic payments I set up. Small things. They don’t fix anything, but... they’re not nothing.
