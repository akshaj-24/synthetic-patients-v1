system: Session 3b41a636-2ece-4693-931c-dee9a9877bf5 transcript

system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Parker. It takes courage to reach out when things feel overwhelming. Before we begin, are you comfortable proceeding with this interview today?

patient: Thank you… I, uh, appreciate that. It’s just… everything feels like a system update that’s 99% complete but crashing repeatedly. I’m here because… well, my kids deserve better than a dad who’s mentally auditing every email at 2 AM. I guess I’m comfortable? As long as I don’t… you know, freeze up. My coffee’s already kicking in, so… let’s do this.

interviewer: I appreciate your willingness to share. Can you let me know if there's anything about the process you'd like to clarify before we start?

patient: I think I’m good… as long as we don’t need me to, uh, ‘reboot’ mid-session. My coffee’s helping, but… I’ll probably start second-guessing every word I say anyway. Just… don’t let me get stuck in a loop. My firewall settings are low today.

interviewer: That sounds challenging. Would you like a brief overview of how our session will proceed today?

patient: I think it’s… like setting up a project plan, right? You outline the milestones so you don’t get stuck in a loop. Just… no surprise detours. I’ll probably start second-guessing the timeline anyway, but as long as we have a roadmap, I can… uh, try not to over-optimize every detail. My coffee’s keeping me upright, so that’s a start.

interviewer: Can you describe what’s been most concerning for you lately, in your own words?

patient: It’s… everything feels like a security vulnerability I can’t patch. My kids’ homework, my emails, even this conversation—I’m constantly scanning for ‘bugs’ that don’t exist. Last week, I spent three hours reformatting a project timeline because *maybe* the margins looked ‘defensive’? My chest hurts just thinking about it. And sleep… I’ll lie awake rehearsing arguments my ex might have with her new partner. It’s stupid, right? I just… can’t hit ‘save’ on the day without checking every line of code twice. Even now, I’m worried I’m over-explaining. My coffee’s probably making it worse.

interviewer: It sounds like this anxiety has been really consuming your time and energy. When did you first start noticing these patterns of worry and over-checking?

patient: I guess... it started in college? I’d spend nights rewriting the same lines of code, convinced a typo would ruin my career. It wasn’t just perfectionism—it felt like a loop with no exit clause. The divorce two years ago... that’s when it really escalated. (Pauses, rubs neck) My chest still tightens thinking about it. I’ll just say it’s ‘normal stress’ most days. Though, (smiles wryly) if I drank less coffee, maybe I’d have time to actually *do* the things I’m stressing over.

interviewer: It sounds like the divorce has added a layer of complexity to your anxiety. Have you noticed specific moments or triggers since the divorce where your worry or physical symptoms, like chest tightness, feel especially intense?

patient: There was... that time after the custody schedule changed. I kept re-reading the email, sure I missed a detail. By the time I realized it was just a typo, my chest felt like a firewall under attack. (Shifts in seat) I spent three hours rechecking my kids’ homework—every decimal point, every spelling error—until my daughter said, 'Dad, it’s *third grade math*.' (Forces a laugh, rubs temples) The irony? I’m writing code for a living, but my own mind? It’s a bug I can’t debug.

interviewer: It sounds like the divorce and custody adjustments have intensified your anxiety in really specific ways. What are you most hoping we can work on together in these sessions?

patient: I guess... I want to find a way to 'debug' this constant loop without my system crashing. (Pauses, rubs chest) The chest tightness isn’t just stress—it’s like my body’s error message I can’t ignore. If we could even figure out which part of the code is causing the infinite loop... the homework checks, the email re-reads, the 'what if I fail them' cycles... (Shrugs, avoids eye contact) Maybe I’ll stop needing three cups of coffee just to keep the UI from freezing. (Forces a small, tired smile)

interviewer: It sounds like this anxiety has been building over time, especially since the divorce. Have you experienced episodes like this before, and if so, what helped or didn't help?

patient: I guess... college was the first time it really spiraled. I’d rewrite code until my eyes were blurry, convinced one mistake would erase everything. But this post-divorce stuff? It’s different. (Sighs, rubs chest) Back then, I could ‘buffer’ by working late, drowning it in caffeine. Now? Even that feels like a temporary patch. The chest thing—it’s constant. Like my body’s error message I can’t reset. (Forces a shrug) Though honestly, the coffee’s still my go-to ‘fix’ even if it just... makes the loops faster. (Pauses) Maybe I’m just bad at ‘debugging’ my own life.

interviewer: It sounds like the post-divorce stress is creating a different kind of pressure than before. Can you share more about any relationships or people who help support you through these challenges?

patient: Support... (Pauses, avoids eye contact) My kids are the main 'buffer,' I guess. I don’t talk to them about this stuff, but seeing their jokes scrawled on homework reminds me why I need to keep the system running. (Rubs chest) The co-parenting’s low-conflict, but it’s like a firewall—I just... process everything through spreadsheets to stay ahead. My mom’s in a facility now, which helps. (Forces a shrug) The coffee and *The Wire* rewatch? Those are my 'temporary patches.' They work until they don’t. (Softly) My daughter says I laugh at her puns ‘like a robot learning humor.’ Maybe she’s right.

interviewer: It seems your kids and structured routines provide some stability despite the stress. Have you sought professional support or tried specific strategies to manage anxiety in the past, and if so, what was helpful or not?

patient: I’ve tried… cognitive-behavioral stuff from a book, you know? The ‘rewrite the script’ angle. It’s like trying to debug a program when the code keeps auto-correcting to the same bug. My sleep tracker app? More of a ‘here’s proof I’m failing at rest’ thing. Coffee’s the real MVP, though—borderline medicinal. It’s the only way I can… keep the loops from spinning so fast. Though I guess if I’m honest, the ‘professional support’ part? I haven’t exactly knocked on many doors. Sounds like another thing I’d screw up.

interviewer: You mentioned relying on caffeine to manage your energy. How much coffee or other caffeinated drinks do you typically consume in a day, and has that amount changed recently?

patient: I’m averaging about 4-5 cups a day, sometimes more… I guess you could say it’s a ‘workaround’ for the mental loops. Lately, I’ve been adding in energy drinks to keep up—bad idea, but it’s like a band-aid that just makes the system crash harder later. Though I suppose that’s better than… freezing up completely.

interviewer: It sounds like caffeine is playing a significant role in how you're managing energy and focus. Have you used any other substances, such as alcohol, cannabis, or prescription medications, in the past month?

patient: I... I’ve had more wine than I’d admit, maybe? Like, if ‘occasional’ means once or twice a week, then sure. It’s just another buffer, right? To slow the loop down. But it doesn’t really work—just makes the crash later feel like a harder drop. No meds, though. I haven’t... I guess I haven’t tried that yet. My doctor just says ‘less coffee, more sleep,’ but the sleep part? Total joke. My body’s just one big warning light these days.

interviewer: Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life, even if they were just passing thoughts?

patient: I don’t know… I guess there’s been moments where it feels like the system’s at 99% error, and you just wonder if pulling the plug would fix it. But I don’t… I can’t really call that a plan or anything. It’s more like a… dark variable in the code I don’t let compile.

interviewer: That metaphor of a 'dark variable' is striking. Have you ever considered how you might go about 'pulling the plug' in those moments—was it something you imagined in detail, or more of a fleeting thought?

patient: It’s more like… the system just grinds to a halt. No real plan, just… hoping the crash is quick. But I don’t let it run that far. My kids need me to keep the code compiling, even if it’s messy. I guess that’s the real firewall—obligation over… everything else.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing that metaphor—it gives me a window into how you're experiencing these thoughts. Have you ever felt any intent or urge to act on those 'dark variables,' even in a small way, and if so, how have you managed to stop yourself?

patient: I—I don’t think I’d call it an ‘intent,’ exactly. More like… a flicker in the code. Like when you’re debugging and you see a syntax error, but your brain keeps rerouting around it. Sometimes late at night, when the caffeine wears off, I’ll… imagine hitting ‘Ctrl+Alt+Del’ on the whole system. But then the kids’ voices cut through it—my daughter humming in the next room, or my son’s homework questions. It’s not courage, really. It’s just… obligation forcing the process to keep running. Though I’ve caught myself mixing wine and energy drinks more these days. Call it a patch. It works… until the error log fills up again.

interviewer: That sounds really tough, Jacob. How often have you been drinking alcohol in the past month, and has that pattern changed compared to earlier this year?

patient: It’s… harder to track exact numbers, but the pattern? Definitely shifted. Earlier this year, it was mostly weekend wine—something to mute the static. Now, I’m mixing it with energy drinks to… offset the crash, I guess? It’s a bandage on a firewall leak. The problem is, the more I patch, the more the system flags errors. But I don’t drink around the kids. Not since the custody thing. Their bedtime is my cutoff. It’s just… noise cancellation for the loops, you know? Temporary. Probably dumb, but temporary feels safer.

interviewer: It sounds like the combination of alcohol and energy drinks is creating a cycle of temporary relief followed by more distress. Have you noticed any specific effects or consequences from mixing them, such as increased anxiety, heart palpitations, or trouble sleeping?

patient: It’s… not like I’m winning any awards for it. The heart thing? Yeah, sometimes it feels like the system’s throwing a 500 error—palpitations, that ‘firewall under attack’ chest tightness. And sleep? More like a memory leak; I crash earlier, but the reboot is just… fragmented. The real kicker is the next-day lag—like my CPU’s running at 20% capacity. But what’s new? It’s just… another variable in the loop.

interviewer: It sounds like your body is signaling significant strain from these habits. Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed less sleep, even when stressed or busy?

patient: No—not really. The energy drinks give this… temporary spike, like a server under a DDoS attack. For an hour, I can power through emails, but then it crashes harder. I’m just… more wired to the point of collapse. It’s not energy. It’s a debt I pay later in shivers and that chest thing. My body’s not recharging, just… limping through the code.

interviewer: It sounds like your body is signaling significant strain from these habits. Have you been prescribed any medications or taken any supplements recently, and if so, have you noticed any side effects?

patient: No prescriptions—haven’t… ‘officially’ sought help. I tried some adaptogens last winter, ashwagandha or something, but it felt like adding a firewall rule that did nothing. My coffee habit’s the only ‘med’ I trust, I guess. It’s just… a known variable. Even if it’s making the loops faster, at least I understand the code.

interviewer: From what you've shared, it sounds like your anxiety has evolved over time—from perfectionism in college to more intense, physically uncomfortable patterns after your divorce. It’s been affecting your work, sleep, and how you parent, even as you’ve tried to manage it with caffeine and structure. What did I miss or get wrong about how this has been unfolding for you?

patient: You’re close, but you missed the... the silent firewalls. My mom’s dementia. I haven’t mentioned it because it feels like another loop I can’t debug—guilt about neglecting her piles on top of everything else. And the resentment I bury about the divorce? It’s not just ‘rehashing childhood’—it’s like a hidden API call that spikes my heart rate when I co-parent. You also didn’t mention how the coffee’s not just a patch—it’s a bandaid on a circuit fire, making the loops faster. My chest still tightens when I think about my kids inheriting this... this code. But I guess that’s just another ‘what if’ I can’t compile.

interviewer: It sounds like your mom’s dementia and the layered emotions around co-parenting are significant pieces I hadn’t fully captured. What else might be important to include that I haven’t caught yet?

patient: There’s… the way I hyper-focus on my kids’ homework. Like, I’ll sit with them for hours ‘debugging’ every comma, but it’s just another loop to avoid thinking about the custody emails. And when I do co-parent, I mentally audit every word—‘Did I sound neutral? Or like a broken record?’—it’s exhausting. My chest… it’s always tight there. I tell myself it’s ‘normal post-separation stress,’ but the code’s just crashing faster.

interviewer: It sounds like your chest tightness and mental loops around co-parenting and homework are really draining. Let me recap: Your anxiety has been worsening since the divorce, with obsessive checking behaviors, physical symptoms like chest discomfort, and reliance on caffeine to manage. The custody adjustments and fear of passing down anxiety to your kids add layers of stress. What did I miss or get wrong about how these pieces connect for you?

patient: You’re right about the loops, but you’re missing how the caffeine’s not just a patch—it’s a feedback loop. The more I drink, the faster the loops spin, and my chest… it feels like a firewall melting down. And the co-parenting? It’s not just the emails—it’s the way I second-guess every ‘good cop’ act I put on for the kids. I keep thinking, ‘What if they pick up on the panic?’ Like I’m coding their future with my own bugs. You didn’t mention the guilt of hiding my mom’s dementia either. It’s like another thread in the same tape loop: ‘Am I failing them all at once?’ But… maybe that’s just more noise in the system.

interviewer: It sounds like the caffeine’s role as a feedback loop, the emotional toll of co-parenting, and the guilt around your mom’s dementia are central to how these loops feel intractable. What did I miss or get wrong about how these pieces connect for you?

patient: You’re right about the feedback loops, but you’re not seeing how the compulsive homework-checking isn’t just a distraction—it’s part of the same system crash. Every time I ‘debug’ a comma, it’s like overclocking the anxiety; my chest tightens harder. And the custody emails… they’re not just emotional—they’re triggers that spike the loops into a faster cycle. You mentioned caffeine, but you missed how it’s not just fueling the loops—it’s making the chest pain sharper, like static electricity before a short circuit. And my mom’s dementia? It’s this… unstable variable I keep trying to ignore, but it’s bleeding into every other loop. I guess what you’re missing is how all these ‘patches’ are just making the system crash faster.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re emphasizing how all these loops—homework-checking, custody emails, caffeine, and your mom’s dementia—are interconnected and accelerating your system’s crash. What else might be important to correct or add before we move to next steps?

patient: I guess... the part I’m still not debugging is how the guilt over my kids inheriting this loops faster than the others. Like, every time I catch myself checking their homework too hard, I think, ‘What if they’re learning to panic from me?’ And the wine/energy drink combo? It’s not just a patch—it’s a crash override. My chest feels like a server farm on fire. But maybe that’s just… more noise in the system.

interviewer: I hear how the fear of passing down anxiety to your kids and the physical toll of mixing wine with energy drinks feel like critical parts of this system crash. What would you like to prioritize as a next step in addressing these loops or their impact on your chest pain and parenting worries?

patient: I guess... the chest tightness when I think about the kids’ homework? It’s like a firewall that’s both protecting and suffocating me. I try to cut back on the coffee, but it’s just another loop—‘will this keep me functional or just make it worse?’ Maybe... maybe prioritizing sleep? But even that feels like debugging a system I don’t know the code for. It’s just... so much to fix.

interviewer: It sounds like the chest tightness linked to homework loops and the coffee paradox are critical points to address. What else feels important to correct or add before we finalize next steps?

patient: There’s... this unacknowledged variable I haven’t debugged yet. My mom’s dementia. It’s like a silent error in the code—every time I skip a call or put off visiting, guilt writes another line of garbage data. It’s not just her, though. It’s the pattern. If I can’t even track this one variable without my chest locking up, how do I know I’m not failing the kids in the same way? The homework checking—it’s not just anxiety. It’s proof I’m still trying to compile a system that keeps crashing.

interviewer: I hear how your mom’s dementia feels like an unresolved variable compounding your anxiety loops and guilt. Is there anything else you’d like to correct or add before we finalize next steps?

patient: There’s… the Wi-Fi router. It’s been down for weeks, and I keep thinking if I can’t fix that, what else am I missing? But the real glitch is the chest tightness when I think about my mom. It’s like a silent error that crashes everything. I guess I’m just… stuck between debugging trivial stuff and ignoring the system warnings. The coffee helps, but it’s like running a firewall on battery power—eventually, the code melts.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re navigating a lot of interconnected pressures right now. To wrap up, let’s clarify next steps—how does scheduling a follow-up in two weeks to review progress on sleep and anxiety management strategies sound? Is there anything else you’d like to address before we end today?

patient: A follow-up in two weeks... I guess that’s manageable. I’ll... try to track the sleep patterns better, but the coffee’s going to be a stubborn bug. And the router—ugh, it’s stupid, right? Trivial compared to everything else. But if the chest tightness doesn’t... I don’t know, *reboot* on its own, maybe we’ll see. Just... don’t want the kids to inherit this code. They deserve a cleaner version of me.

interviewer: It sounds like you're committed to tracking your sleep and managing caffeine as we move toward our next session. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up today?

patient: The router’s still dead, and I keep thinking if I can’t fix that, what else am I missing? But the real glitch… it’s this chest tightness when I think about my mom. It’s like a silent error that crashes everything. I’ll… try to cut back on the coffee, but it’s just another loop—‘functional or just delaying the crash?’ Ugh. Maybe the homework checking’s a firewall, at least it’s *doing* something.

interviewer: It sounds like the chest tightness and emotional loops you're describing are really weighing on you. Let's make sure we check in on that progress during our next session—how does scheduling a follow-up in two weeks feel for you?

patient: Two weeks feels like a scheduled task I can’t quite commit to the queue. I’ll need the coffee to stay on task, but… what if something breaks before then? It’s just another loop, I guess. I’ll manage.

interviewer: It sounds like committing to the follow-up feels like a task you’re not fully ready to prioritize right now. If there’s anything specific you’d need to feel more confident about scheduling, what would that be?

patient: I guess… if there was a reality check that this isn’t just me duct-taping a firewall together? Like, if I knew the coffee wasn’t just buying time before everything crashes? But that sounds defeatist. My kids’ homework deadlines are the only real 'commitments' I can remember right now. Maybe if scheduling the session felt like adding a line of code that actually compiles, instead of another error log I’ll ignore.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re seeking reassurance that this process isn’t just another task to add to the list—but something that could actually *work* for you. Let’s make sure we clarify: what specific part of scheduling the follow-up would help feel more like a solution than a ‘patch’ right now?

patient: If the follow-up had… guardrails? Like, if there was a specific tool or framework we could test together—something that actually compiles, not just another script I’ll rewrite in my head? I guess I need to know this isn’t just another dependency I’ll uninstall when the panic spikes. My daughter’s math gradebook is the only thing I remember updating without cross-checking it three times… maybe if this felt like that? A system that *works* enough to stick.

interviewer: I hear how important it is for this process to feel reliable, like the gradebook example you mentioned. Let’s agree on one specific tool or method we can use to track your follow-up progress—something that feels like a working system for you. What would that look like?

patient: Maybe… a physical checklist? Like a notepad where I write one non-negotiable task each day? Not digital—something I can’t ‘rebase’ into oblivion. But it’d have to be simple, like… a system health check? Five minutes, no loops. But what if I over-engineer it? My coffee’s already a dependency I can’t debug.

interviewer: I hear how important it is for this checklist to feel simple and reliable, like the gradebook example. Let’s agree to start with that physical system health check—how does committing to that tool feel for you right now?

patient: It feels… like installing a lightweight script instead of another bloated framework. I’ll try the notepad thing, but what if I turn it into a ‘dependency’ I have to debug? My daughter’s gradebook works because it’s read-only—this feels like giving myself write access to second-guess everything. Maybe if I… pair it with the coffee? At least the jitters and the checklist would crash together if something goes wrong.
