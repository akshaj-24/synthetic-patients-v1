system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Hi Patricia, it's nice to meet you. Before we start, would you prefer a different name or pronouns?

patient: No, that's... that's fine. I guess you could just stick with Patricia. I'm forgetful enough as it is without adding to the confusion.

interviewer: I can see that being forgetful might add to the stress. Patricia, would you be comfortable moving forward with our conversation today, and is there anything you'd like to clarify before we begin?

patient: Yeah, I'm... I'm okay. Just need to keep it short, you know? My supervisor's been strict about overtime lately. I'll be fine, really. Just... tired. It's nothing that can't wait.

interviewer: I can see how important it is to keep this efficient—would you be comfortable proceeding with our conversation today?

patient: Yeah, sure. I mean, as long as we don’t... you know, get too bogged down. My break time’s kind of tight, but I’ll make it work. The coffee machine’s been acting up again, so I’ll need to troubleshoot that later. It’s just... procedural stuff, nothing emotional or anything.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to manage alone. Can you tell me a bit about when you first started noticing these feelings of being down and exhausted?

patient: It's hard to pinpoint, really. I guess... maybe around the time the night shift error happened? My supervisor was understanding, but I just started feeling like I was... slower, you know? Like my brain was stuck in neutral. And the sleep—well, I wake up at 3 a.m. most nights, and by morning I'm just... numb. But it's probably just getting older, right? You lose a little spark.

interviewer: It sounds like the night shift error might have been a turning point for you. Can you share how that incident affected your confidence or stress levels at work?

patient: I guess... it just made me more careful, you know? I started double-checking everything, holding my steering wheel tighter during shifts to stay awake. The supervisor didn’t say much, but I could feel the tension. It’s not like I’m reckless—I’ve been doing this job 12 years. Maybe it’s just getting older and slower, like I said before.

interviewer: It sounds like the sleep issues and work stress are really taking a toll. What are you most hoping we can address in our time together today?

patient: I guess... I just want to feel like I can keep up, you know? The shifts are long, and if I could sleep through them without waking up foggy, maybe I’d be less... on edge. The last mistake wasn’t a big deal, but it’s stuck with me. I don’t want to be the one holding things up anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like the disrupted sleep is adding to the pressure you're feeling at work. Can you describe your typical sleep pattern and how it affects your daily functioning?

patient: I guess... I used to think I could power through it. You know, wake up at 3, try to nap in the car between shifts, but my head just feels heavy, like sandbags. I’ll grip the steering wheel so tight my knuckles hurt, trying to stay awake. It’s not that I’m not trying to be careful—I just... foggy all the time. The coffee machine’s been broken for weeks, but I haven’t even bothered to fix it. What’s the point if I’m just going to crash again?

interviewer: Have you experienced periods in the past where you felt similarly down or struggled with energy and motivation?

patient: I guess... there was that time after my dad passed, but that felt different. More like... empty, maybe? This feels heavier, like weights in my hands even when I'm not doing anything. Back then, I just powered through, told myself it was grief. Now it's like the weights are always there, even when I'm not thinking about work or Mom's diagnosis. Hard to explain, really.

interviewer: It sounds like this feels more persistent and heavier than before. When you powered through after your dad's passing, what strategies helped you manage that difficult time?

patient: I guess... I just kept busy, you know? Focused on work, chores, anything to not... dwell. Mark would ask how I was, but I didn’t want to drag him into it. So I just kept moving, like if I slowed down, the thoughts would catch up. Doesn’t really help now, though.

interviewer: It sounds like staying busy has been a way to avoid facing difficult thoughts, but that it's becoming harder to manage now. Have you experienced other periods in your life where you felt similarly overwhelmed by low mood or exhaustion, even if the circumstances were different?

patient: I guess... there was that time after my dad passed. Not exactly the same, but I felt like I was just... going through the motions. But that’s normal, right? When something big happens? This feels different somehow. More like... I don’t know. The coffee machine breaking? It’s stupid things. You start wondering if everything’s just going to fall apart eventually. But maybe that’s just getting older.

interviewer: It sounds like this sense of instability is different from past experiences. How has your husband supported you during this time, and are there any challenges in your relationship that might be adding to your stress?

patient: Mark tries, I guess. He'll bring home takeout sometimes, or remind me to take a break. But I just... snap at him. It's not him, really. I feel like I'm not making it easy. The washing machine's been acting up again, and I can't even focus on fixing it. He probably wishes I'd just... let him fix it. But I don't want to drag him into all this.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of guilt about how you're handling things at home. How have you been managing stressors like the washing machine issue lately?

patient: Honestly? It’s just another thing piling up. The washer’s been making this weird thudding noise for weeks, but I keep telling myself I’ll look into it… later. I even wrote it down on my phone, but then I forget to check the note. Mark offered to call a repair guy, but I don’t want him spending money on something that might just need a part. Besides, if I can’t even handle fixing a machine, what does that say about me?

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to handle everything on your own. Have you ever sought professional help or therapy during past periods of low mood or stress?

patient: I guess not. To be honest, I haven’t. When things got heavy after Dad died, I just... focused on keeping things running. Mark suggested talking to someone once, but I told him I was fine. It’s not like there’s a manual for this kind of stuff, you know? You just... figure it out. Or you don’t.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: I guess... sometimes I think about how nice it would be to just... not have to worry about any of it anymore. But it’s not like that. I mean, Mark’s been through enough already. If anything, I’d hate to make things harder for him. It’s just... tired, you know? Like the washing machine—sometimes you just let it thud and hope it doesn’t flood the whole house.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight, and it's clear you care about Mark's well-being. Have you thought about any specific way or means to try to end your life?

patient: No, I... I don’t think about it like that. It’s just... tired, you know? Like my brain’s stuck in neutral. Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever feel normal again, but that’s probably just the exhaustion talking. Honestly, I’ve been so focused on keeping up with the washing machine before it dies completely... Mark’s already mentioned the piles in the laundry room, and I hate letting him see that part of me.

interviewer: I hear how heavy this exhaustion feels, even as you're holding things together for Mark. Have you been using alcohol, cannabis, or any other substances more or less than usual lately?

patient: No, I don’t drink alcohol... never really liked it. My dad had a temper, so I’ve always avoided it. I stick to black tea, though—measure it out in precise spoonfuls. It’s the one thing that feels... manageable. Like, if I can get the tea right, maybe the rest of the day won’t fall apart. I guess that sounds silly, but...

interviewer: I appreciate how you find small rituals to ground yourself. Have you used cannabis, stimulants, or any other substances more or less than usual lately?

patient: No, I don’t use anything else... never really seen the point. The tea is my... my little routine. If I mess with that, what’s left? I guess work keeps me too busy anyway—there’s always something to fix before my shift. Even the steering wheel feels more real than... than most things lately.

interviewer: I hear how your routine and work provide a sense of structure. Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins on a regular basis?

patient: No medications... just the tea. It’s the one thing that feels manageable. I guess I take a multivitamin sometimes, but I can’t even remember the last time I bothered. Work keeps me too busy—there’s always something to fix before my shift. If I stop moving, I’m afraid I’ll just... stop altogether.

interviewer: I hear how work and routine feel like anchors for you right now. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or need significantly less sleep than usual?

patient: No, not really. I mean, there are days when I’m so exhausted I can barely keep my eyes open at work... like, I have to grip the steering wheel just to stay awake. But when I do sleep, it’s not like I wake up energized or anything. It’s more like... my body shuts down for a few hours. The only thing that feels consistent is this tiredness, you know? Like a background hum.

interviewer: I hear how exhaustion is deeply intertwined with your daily functioning. Have you ever experienced periods where you felt unusually energetic or required significantly less sleep than usual?

patient: No, not really. I mean, I’ve been... tired, definitely. Some nights I lie awake until the numbers on the clock start blurring, you know? My body feels like a worn-out machine—gotta keep the steering wheel gripped tight just to stay awake at work. But energy? That’s not been part of it. If anything, I move slower these days, like I’m wading through... something thick. The washing machine’s been sitting half-full for weeks. I just can’t muster the 'why bother' to finish it.

interviewer: I hear how this persistent fatigue is affecting both your physical movements and daily tasks. Have you noticed any experiences where you see or hear things that others might not, or have beliefs that feel unusual or confusing to others?

patient: No, not really. I mean, my mind feels... foggy sometimes, like when the coffee machine’s broken and you can’t even make sense of the parts. But that’s just me being tired, I guess. I don’t... I don’t think there’s anything *weird* about it. Just... heavy, you know? Like everything takes twice as long to process.

interviewer: That sounds really tough. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions such as thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain that might be contributing to your fatigue or sleep disturbances?

patient: No, nothing like that. I mean, the doctor ran some basic tests last year—blood work, routine stuff—and everything was normal. I guess... it's just me, you know? Getting older and slower. My body's like that washing machine I can't bring myself to fix—sometimes you just let it sit because the effort feels pointless. But I'm fine, really. Just... tired.

interviewer: Patricia, from what we’ve discussed, it sounds like you’ve been feeling persistently low and fatigued for weeks, with disrupted sleep, trouble focusing at work, and strained relationships. These symptoms seem to have worsened after a recent work mistake, and you’re carrying a lot of self-criticism and pressure to manage everything alone. There’s also a history of grief and caregiving stress, but your husband Mark’s support is a key strength. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... there’s the tea. I measure each cup like it’s some kind of ritual. And baking my mom’s cookies, even though they’re crumbly. It’s the only thing that feels... normal. But I hate that even that feels like a chore now. And sometimes I think, what’s the point of waking up tomorrow? But I just... push through. The steering wheel’s got more grip than my will these days.

interviewer: It sounds like those rituals are the last threads of normalcy you’re holding onto, even as they feel like a burden now. Let me recap: You’ve described persistent low mood, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and strained relationships, with recent passive thoughts about the point of continuing. We’ve also explored how work stress, self-criticism, and a history of caregiving/grief contribute to this. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... the calls to my brother. I keep them light, just talk about his kids. Don’t want to drag him into this. And baking—my mom’s recipe. Even though they crumble. It’s... something to do. Keeps the hands busy, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like staying connected to your brother and the comfort of familiar routines are important ways you’re navigating this difficult time. Is there anything else I haven’t captured about your experience that feels important to mention before we discuss next steps?

patient: I guess the cookies... they’re not perfect, but they’re edible. My mom’s recipe, you know? It’s the only thing that feels like it matters lately. And the steering wheel—I just grip it tight, like maybe that’ll keep me from falling apart. But I tell myself it’s just tiredness. Nothing to worry about.

interviewer: It sounds like things have been really overwhelming lately, and it takes a lot of strength to keep going. Is there anything specific you'd like to make sure we address before we wrap up today?

patient: I guess... the tea. It’s the only thing that feels like I’m doing something right. Measure it just right, heat it up, and for a minute, it’s not all... static. But even that’s getting harder. The mugs are piling up again.
