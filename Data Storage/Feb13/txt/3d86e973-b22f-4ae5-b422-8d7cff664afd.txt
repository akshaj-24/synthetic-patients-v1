system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Hello Jennifer, I'm Corey Fitzgerald. To start, is there a preferred name or pronouns I should use with you today?

patient: It’s Jennifer. No preferred pronouns—I guess? Just call me Jennifer. I’m… easy like that. My coworkers say I’m the ‘model employee,’ ha. I just like knowing where I stand, you know? Less room for… mistakes.

interviewer: That sounds like a good approach to staying on top of things. Jennifer, just to set the frame, today’s session will involve discussing your concerns and how we can support you. Does that sound okay with you?

patient: Yeah, sure. I mean, I guess talking through things can help. At work, we have checklists to make sure everything’s done right… maybe this is like that? As long as we stick to the plan, I can handle it. I just… hope we don’t get stuck in loops, you know? My head’s already scrubbing tiles nonstop tonight.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about how your mind feels right now. Do you have any immediate questions about how this session will go before we begin?

patient: No, I don’t think so. The plan is… good. At work, we stick to checklists so nothing slips through, you know? I just hope we can stay on track. My head’s already on the wash cycle tonight, but I guess that’s normal? I’ll manage.

interviewer: It sounds like the fear of losing your job or pushing people away feels really pressing for you. Can you tell me when you first noticed these worries starting?

patient: It started... I guess during the pandemic? When they made us disinfect everything, not just clean. I wanted to do it 'perfectly' so no one got sick, but then my brain kept replaying 'What if I missed a spot?' Even after things eased up, the... the hyper-checking stayed. My dad used to snap, 'Worry fixes nothing!' but I guess that's just how I roll. It's like my head's stuck on the 'scrub mode' switch, you know?

interviewer: That sounds really frustrating. Can you tell me how this has affected your personal relationships or daily self-care routines outside of work?

patient: Honestly, it’s... I guess it makes me kind of a terrible hostess? My sister’s going through chemo, but I can’t even bring myself to visit without double-checking my bank account for three days straight. I started drinking more wine, but I tell myself it’s ‘social’ even when I’m just on the balcony alone with my herbs. My hands don’t always cooperate when I try to prune them, though—cramp up like I’m scrubbing tiles again. My niece says I’m ‘funny when I let myself be,’ but I mess up most days by over-apologizing or... well, just not being there. Haha. I’m a professional over-functioner, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like your body is reacting physically to the stress you're carrying. When did you first start noticing the hand cramps when you try to prune your herbs?

patient: I think it started... maybe a year ago? Around when the pandemic really took hold? I was so focused on scrubbing everything at work that my hands just... got stuck in 'scrub mode,' even when I wasn’t doing anything. Now when I try to prune my basil, my fingers lock up like I’m still wiping down doorknobs. My niece says I ‘grip like I’m cleaning a germ-infested toilet,’ which is kind of true. I guess it’s just... hard to untangle them from all the other tension?

interviewer: It sounds like your hands are carrying a lot of that stress. What would you most like to achieve through our work together?

patient: I guess... I’d like to stop gripping everything so tight, you know? Like my herbs—they don’t need me to be perfect, just present. Maybe if my hands would stop cramping, I could actually enjoy tending them instead of dreading it. And maybe... not over-checking every bill until I’m dizzy. Small things, I know.

interviewer: It sounds like the hand cramps are adding to the frustration of wanting to connect with your herbs. Can you tell me how often you experience these cramps, and are there other situations besides pruning where this happens?

patient: It’s... more often than I’d like to admit. Even when I’m just washing dishes or holding my phone too long, my fingers sort of... clench up like they’re still in ‘scrub mode.’ I guess it’s just my hands being dramatic about everything, even small stuff. My niece says they ‘remember the pandemic better than I do,’ which is probably true. I try to laugh it off, but it’s hard not to feel like my body’s stuck on repeat sometimes. Haha—do you get how that makes sense?

interviewer: It sounds like you've been managing a lot at work and home while trying to stay on top of things. Have you experienced similar episodes of anxiety or perfectionism in the past, and if so, what helped you manage them back then?

patient: I guess... I’ve always been the type to ‘overprepare’? Like, my dad used to snap at me for worrying too much, so I just got really good at double-checking everything—like, washing a doorknob seven times until it ‘felt right.’ Back then, I thought it was just being responsible. Now? It’s the same habits, but they’re like... gremlins in my head, you know? They’ll wash dishes until they’re ‘germ-free’ but then make me second-guess the bills for hours. Haha. My body’s still on ‘scrub mode,’ but my brain’s just... adding more tasks. Forever.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to carry those habits from childhood into adulthood. Can you tell me more about how your relationship with your father shaped your approach to responsibility and mistakes back then?

patient: Ugh. My dad was like... a scrub brush set to 'never stop.' If I messed up, he’d bark, 'Worry fixes nothing!' but then I’d worry harder to prove I wasn’t lazy. Now I guess I’m stuck in this loop where I over-plan my cleaning routes just to avoid 'looking bad' at work. My hands cramp from gripping the spray bottle too tight, but I can’t slow down—I’m always trying to fix things before they break. Even my sister’s chemo bills? I keep thinking, 'If I just check the numbers one more time, maybe I’ll find a solution.' It’s like my brain’s a sink that won’t stop leaking. Haha—if that makes sense?

interviewer: That sounds incredibly burdensome to carry both your own anxiety and your sister's medical stressors. How has her chemo treatment and the financial concerns around it been affecting your anxiety specifically?

patient: It’s a lot to juggle, honestly. I guess I feel... like I’m holding a bunch of plates spinning, but one’s cracked (pauses, rubs hands together). The chemo bills? I keep checking the numbers on my phone, even though I know I can’t magic money into existence. My hands get these cramps from gripping the phone too tight—it’s like my body’s trying to scrub the stress away. I hate that I can’t just... visit her more, but every day I don’t go feels like I’m letting her down. Then I tell myself, ‘Jennifer, you’re being silly,’ and take a swig of my ‘social’ wine. Haha—if that makes sense?

interviewer: I want to ask about your alcohol use. How often have you been drinking wine, and have you noticed any changes in how you use it recently?

patient: It’s… a few times a week, maybe? Like, after shifts or when the bills feel like another pass at Scrub Mode. I tell myself it’s ‘social,’ but really it’s just… softening the edges of the noise. My hands still clench the glass until they cramp, though. Haha—guess I’m just collecting wine-glass calluses instead of cleaning ones now. Not a habit I’d call ‘recent,’ but… maybe I’m using it more when the chemo numbers feel too sharp to swallow. If that makes sense?

interviewer: I hear how the wine helps you manage stress, but also notice the physical tension it brings. Have you used any other substances, like cannabis, stimulants, or opioids, either recently or in the past?

patient: No, nothing else—wine’s my... I guess you could say my ‘go-to’ for unwinding? I tried edibles once with friends years ago, but the paranoia hit harder than the relaxation. Now that sounds dramatic, right? I’m not even sure why I mentioned that. And stimulants? Please, I’m already running on fumes most days. Opioids? No way, I’d rather scrub floors forever than mess with that. Though... my hands still cramp from gripping the glass so tight. Haha—if that makes sense?

interviewer: I want to check in about your safety. Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life?

patient: No—no actual plans or anything. I guess... sometimes I wonder if it would just stop the noise, but then I think about my niece’s drawings on the fridge and feel selfish even thinking it. Haha, my hands get all clammy just talking about this. I’d rather... I’d rather scrub floors forever, really. Even if my hands cramp the whole time.

interviewer: It sounds like your niece's drawings give you a sense of purpose and motivation to keep going. Have you noticed any changes in how much you need to sleep or if you feel more energetic than usual lately?

patient: I guess my sleep’s been... jagged? Like, I’ll lie there counting the minutes until I have to get up for work. My hands cramp up sometimes, even when I’m just trying to hold a glass of wine. It’s not like I’m exhausted, but I feel... frayed? If that makes sense. Haha, I’m just being dramatic, right? It’s probably just stress from the bills and everything.

interviewer: It sounds like the frayed feeling is connected to both your physical tension and mental fatigue. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels lately—either feeling more energized than usual or more drained than typical?

patient: I guess... I feel like I'm running on, like, 30% battery most days? But I just keep hitting the 'play' button because there's no time to recharge. My hands still cramp when I'm doing dishes or holding my phone, which is weird because I'm not even lifting anything heavy. Haha, I'm just a human rechargeable, I guess. If that makes sense?

interviewer: It sounds like the physical and mental fatigue is really taking a toll. Have you noticed any times when you feel more energetic or have less need for sleep than usual, even if it's temporary?

patient: Eh, maybe when I’m in ‘scrub mode’? Like that one time I stayed up past midnight disinfecting the whole bathroom just to feel... in control? But that’s not really energy, right? More like panic with a flashlight. My hands cramp so bad after that, I can’t even text my sister back without wincing. Haha, sounds crazy, but it’s just... the way the day goes, I guess?

interviewer: It sounds like the physical strain from your 'scrub mode' energy is really impacting your hands. When did you first notice these cramps starting, and have they seemed connected to stress or specific tasks?

patient: I guess the cramps started... maybe around the pandemic? When I was, like, hyper-focused on disinfecting everything? My hands would hurt after scrubbing the same spot three times. Now it’s weird because even scrolling on my phone too long does it. Haha, I’m just... a human rechargeable with poor battery management? If that makes sense?

interviewer: It sounds like your 'scrub mode' is more about stress-driven activity. Have you ever had times when you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep, even when you weren't stressed?

patient: Nope, most days I'm just... low battery. Unless I'm in 'scrub mode,' which is more panic than energy. Haha, I guess I'm just a one-trick pony like that. My herbs? Yeah, I can prune those for hours without tiring. But that's 'cause I'm trying not to overwater them... you know, avoid mistakes. If that makes sense?

interviewer: I want to make sure I understand your current health picture. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including over-the-counter ones?

patient: No meds, really. Just... a bottle of cheap red wine to keep the thoughts from scrubbing too hard. Ha. I guess you could call it a social lubricant, if that makes sense?

interviewer: I want to make sure we cover all bases. Have you ever experienced hearing voices, seeing things that others don’t, or having thoughts that others want to control you?

patient: No, nothing like that. My head’s more like a radio that’s stuck between stations—just static, you know? I guess if I had voices, they’d be my dad’s old ‘Worry fixes nothing!’ yell. But that’s just… me, I think. Ha.

interviewer: So, to recap, you've been experiencing persistent anxiety and intrusive thoughts since the pandemic, which have led to compulsive checking and cleaning behaviors. These symptoms are causing physical strain like hand cramps and affecting your work and relationships, especially with your sister undergoing chemo. You've been using wine to cope but want to reduce perfectionism and reconnect with activities like gardening. What did I miss?

patient: Oh, um... I guess the part about my boss giving me that warning about being late? I think I mentioned it but maybe not how it feels like proof I’m one mistake from being useless. And... there’s my niece’s drawings. They’re all over my fridge, bright and messy. I tell myself that maybe things don’t need to be perfect to be okay. But then I worry I’m just setting her up for disappointment. If that makes sense?

interviewer: What did I miss?

patient: Oh—and the whole thing with my sister's treatments... I can't afford to take unpaid leave, so I just... send get-well cards. It feels like scrubbing my budget into pennies and calling it 'thoughtful.' I guess I'm the worst cousin?

interviewer: It sounds like feeling guilty about not being able to support your sister financially adds to your stress. What else did I miss?

patient: The hand cramps... they happen even when I'm just holding a coffee cup at work. And the guilt about my sister—it's like my brain's scrubbing my budget into dust, trying to find more pennies. I guess I drink more wine to... soften the edges. But my niece's drawings... they're messy but bright. Maybe they're trying to tell me something. If that makes sense?
