system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Hi Claudia, thank you for coming in today. To start, may I have your full name and pronouns if you're comfortable sharing?

patient: Claudia Cochran. She/her. I’ll just… adjust my scarf, if that’s okay? It’s been giving me a knot in the neck, like holding a brick or something. Should’ve known better than to wear it with a turtleneck. Work’s been crazy—charts, charts, charts—but I’m here, so that’s what matters, right?

interviewer: It sounds like you've had a demanding time at work lately. Are you comfortable with me proceeding with today's interview?

patient: Yes, I guess. Let me just… adjust my scarf again. It’s not helping, but maybe it’ll buy me a minute. Proceed, I suppose. I’ve just been so wound up lately—work, you know, the usual chaos. It’s not *you*, I hope that’s clear. I just… need to make sure I’m not wasting your time. Is that terrible?

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now—would you like me to explain how this session will work before we move forward?

patient: Sure, if that’s necessary. I just… I find structure helps. Like with patient charts—knowing the protocol. It’s… it’s not that I don’t trust the process, I just need to know the steps. But maybe that’s just my default setting.

interviewer: It makes sense that having clear steps can provide a sense of control. How would you feel about me outlining the approximate structure of our session before we continue?

patient: Yes, that would… that would help, actually. I appreciate it. I just need to make sure I don’t… you know, derail things with my usual overthinking. My neck’s still screaming like a stressed EKG, but at least I’d have a roadmap. Maybe I can stop circling the same worries like a broken playlist.

interviewer: I can see how having a clear plan might feel reassuring right now. To outline the session, we’ll start by discussing what’s been troubling you, then explore your thoughts and feelings, and work together to identify strategies that might help. Does that sound okay, or would you like to adjust anything before we begin?

patient: That sounds... structured, which I guess is what I need. Though my brain’s already drafting ten possible ways this could go off the rails. (Adjusts scarf, fingers lingering at the knot.) My neck’s still holding a brick, but I’ll try to stick to the plan. As long as we don’t... veer into open-ended discussions. They tend to turn into my head’s version of a sieve—everything leaks out.

interviewer: It makes sense you'd prefer structure to manage the overwhelm. Do you have any questions or need any clarifications before we move forward?

patient: Just... one clarification. When you said 'explore your thoughts,' does that mean we’ll stick to specific topics or might it... wander? (Fingers brush scarf knot, then still.) My brain’s already flagging hypotheticals about my partner’s upcoming surgery, rent deadlines, you know—routine stuff. As long as we don’t spiral into ‘what ifs,’ I can focus. Let’s say... 20-minute increments with check-ins? Like a shift report.

interviewer: I appreciate your clarity about needing structure—let’s use those 20-minute check-ins to stay grounded. Does that plan work for you, or would you like to adjust anything before we begin?

patient: Yes, the check-ins... that should help. My fingers are already itching to make a flowchart in my head. (Adjusts scarf, pauses at the knot.) As long as we... stick to the timeline, I can avoid the spiral. Though my brain just added 'landlord follow-ups' to the mental triage list. (Forces a small laugh.) Let’s assume the brick in my neck is... part of the job hazard. If we stay on script, I can focus. Maybe.

interviewer: It sounds like the constant worries and physical tension are really taking a toll on you. Can you tell me more about what’s been most overwhelming for you right now?

patient: The biggest thing? It’s like my body’s on sympathetic overdrive even when my mind knows it should rest. My neck’s still got that brick, and my chest feels like it’s bracing for a storm that might not even hit. (Adjusts scarf, fingers pausing at the knot.) I keep rehearsing scripts for the landlord conversation, for my partner’s surgery consult… it’s all ‘what if’ scenarios piling up. I tell myself I’m just being proactive, but… (exhales sharply) …the other night I stayed up calculating worst-case numbers until my head throbbed. My brain won’t file things properly. It’s like a broken playlist that loops the most stressful tracks.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. When did you first start noticing these physical symptoms and racing thoughts becoming this persistent?

patient: The neck tension? It’s been a… constant companion since residency, really. Back then, I chalked it up to long shifts. But six months ago, when Mark’s insurance lapsed, it… solidified into this brick. Like my body knew the stakes before my brain did. (Fingers brush scarf knot, then drop.) I guess I’ve always had a backup alarm for ‘what ifs,’ though. My parents’ arguments taught me to anticipate problems before they hit. Now it’s just… louder. And the fatigue? It’s not the kind from work. It’s like my brain’s running a looped emergency drill 24/7.

interviewer: It seems like your body has been holding onto stress for a long time, especially with recent worries about Mark’s health and financial stability. Can you help me understand what you consider your top one or two concerns right now?

patient: The two big ones... Mark’s health insurance situation keeps me up night—what if something happens and we’re not prepared? And then there’s this... this constant ache in my neck, like a brick stacked on top, that I can’t seem to shake. I tell myself it’s just stress from work, but sometimes I worry I’m so focused on everyone else’s stability that I’m ignoring my own breaking points.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight for others while feeling stretched thin yourself. How have these worries and physical symptoms affected your work performance or interactions with colleagues lately?

patient: It’s… it’s like my brain won’t let me focus fully, even when I’m at work. I catch myself rereading charts or emails, double-checking things that should be simple, just to feel like I’m *doing* something productive. My neck… it’s so tight some days I have to adjust my scarf constantly, like if I don’t, I’ll forget to breathe. And then there’s the meetings—my mind just blanks sometimes. Last week I snapped at a nurse about a medication dosage, even though she was right. I felt awful afterward, but the guilt just adds to the… the noise.

interviewer: It sounds like the guilt after snapping at the nurse adds another layer to the mental 'noise' you're managing. Have these episodes of irritability or difficulty concentrating been happening more frequently over time, or are they situational?

patient: They’re... more frequent, honestly. Like the insurance thing isn’t just a ‘situational’ stressor—it’s this background hum that sharpens into static whenever I’m in meetings or reviewing charts. The guilt after lashing out? It’s like adding salt to a wound that’s already bleeding. I tell myself it’s ‘just fatigue,’ but my brain won’t let me rest. Last week, I forgot to order supplies for the clinic. For me. That’s... that’s a new kind of unreliable.

interviewer: It sounds like the recent forgetfulness at work adds to your sense of being 'unreliable' in a way that feels new and concerning. What would you most hope to achieve through this therapy process?

patient: I guess... I want to stop feeling like my brain’s on loop, you know? Like, if I could just learn to ‘pause’ the endless what-ifs for five minutes, maybe my neck wouldn’t feel like it’s holding a brick. And maybe I wouldn’t snap at people I respect. I don’t want to be the one who’s always the backup plan for everyone else’s stability. But I don’t even know where to start—therapy feels like another chart I’m supposed to fill out, and I’m already late on rent.

interviewer: It sounds like your current stressors are deeply tied to both work and personal responsibilities. Have you experienced similar episodes of anxiety and physical tension in the past, perhaps during your residency or other challenging periods, and if so, what helped you manage them at the time?

patient: Residency was... similar, but different. I’d push through with structure—like treating my schedule like a patient chart. If I had a 3 a.m. shift, I’d map out every minute to avoid ‘wasting time’ panicking. But this? This feels heavier. The brick in my neck was there then, but now it’s... paired with this nagging fear that I’m failing everyone. Caffeine used to help, but now it just makes my hands shake worse. And therapy? I’m not sure it’s not just another chart I’ll mess up filling out.

interviewer: That sounds really isolating—like you're carrying this weight alone. How has your partner supported you through this, or what do you wish they could do to help with the stress?

patient: Mark… he leaves those little notes on my laptop, you know, things like 'You’ve got this' or 'Breathe, not too hard.' It’s sweet, but I feel guilty taking them seriously when I’m over-checking his coffee order for the third time today. What I wish… I don’t want to sound ungrateful, but sometimes I wish he’d stop worrying about *my* stress and just… focus on his own stuff. His health, his job—stuff that actually *matters*. But then I think, what if *my* anxiety is just his problem too? What if I’m the one making it worse?

interviewer: It sounds like you're caught between appreciating Mark's support and feeling pressure about his focus on you. Have there been times when this dynamic either helped you manage stress or added to it in the past?

patient: There was that time last winter when he started tracking my sleep patterns in his journal, you know? He meant well, but it felt like he was… calibrating me like a machine. I’d lie awake hating the fact that I couldn’t ‘optimize’ my rest, even as my neck turned to concrete. It helped? Maybe. But it also made me want to scream that I’m not some algorithm he can troubleshoot. Now he’s always… hovering, like if he focuses hard enough, he could defrag my brain. But what if I’m just a corrupted file?

interviewer: That sounds really frustrating—like you're caught between needing support and wanting space. How do you usually cope when his focus on you feels overwhelming?

patient: I... I guess I fall back on work. If I’m buried in charts or emails, there’s less time for the… the noise. But even then, my neck feels like it’s hosting a rock concert. Sometimes I’ll make these absurdly detailed lists—like, categorizing my coffee mugs by ‘risk of anxiety induction’—just to feel like I’m not fracturing. It doesn’t help, really. It just… makes me feel worse when I realize how silly it is.

interviewer: It sounds like these coping strategies, while intended to help, are adding to your distress. Can you tell me about any experiences in your childhood or family history that might have shaped how you approach stress or responsibilities now?

patient: My parents… they were always balancing on a tightrope between practicality and panic. When they argued about money, I’d… I’d force myself to study harder, like if I aced another exam, I could somehow stabilize the whole household. It’s silly, but I guess that’s where this need to ‘optimize’ everything comes from—like if I micromanage *my* world enough, nothing will fall apart. My neck feels like a vice sometimes, but I tell myself it’s just… it’s just how I’m wired.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry from such a young age. Were there other family dynamics or experiences during your childhood that you think might influence how you handle stress or responsibilities now?

patient: I... my parents always said I overreacted. If I mentioned feeling overwhelmed, they’d say, 'It’s just a test, Claudia,' like stress was something I could recalibrate. I guess that’s why I still tell myself I’m 'just wired' this way, even when my neck feels like it’s been braced for an earthquake I didn’t see coming.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging. What do you think has been one of your key strengths or strategies that have helped you manage these pressures over time?

patient: Problem-solving, I guess? It’s... it’s both a strength and a curse. I break everything down into steps, like a patient chart. If I can name the variables, it feels like I can control the outcome. But half the time my brain just keeps appending new 'complications' to the case. Caffeine helps me function, though I’m sure that’s obvious. And... I make terrible sourdough, but kneading the dough actually relaxes my neck. My partner leaves these stupid sticky notes—‘Breathe, not too hard’—which I pretend to find endearing. It’s just... it’s easier to focus on the dough or the coffee than admit I’m terrified I’ll botch everything, you know?

interviewer: That sounds really tough… Have you had any thoughts about ending your life or hurting yourself recently?

patient: No, I haven’t… not like that. I mean, there are nights when I wish I could hit ‘pause’ on my brain, you know? Like when I’m kneading dough and the noise in my head finally quiets for ten seconds. But that’s… that’s different. My patients deserve better than that kind of thinking. I guess I just… I don’t want to sound dramatic, but sometimes the weight of it all feels like that brick in my neck. It’s there, but I’m still here. Still showing up.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty... Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or need very little sleep, even when stressed?

patient: Unusually energetic? I think my body’s on a permanent ‘low battery’ setting. I mean, caffeine’s a crutch I’m not proud of, but it’s the difference between functional and... crumbling in the supply closet. The only time I feel like I’m not dragging is when I’m hyper-focused on a problem—like debugging a patient chart at 2 a.m.—but that’s just my brain overcompensating. I guess it’s less ‘manic’ and more... a human doomsday clock ticking in reverse. My neck’s still holding that brick, though, so maybe I’m not the best judge of energy levels.

interviewer: I understand how exhausting that must be... Have you been using alcohol or other substances to cope with stress or sleep issues?

patient: Occasionally, maybe a glass of wine on weekends. I tell myself it’s earned, not escapism. But I’d never do anything that might... interfere with work or reliability. Caffeine’s my real issue, honestly. It’s just... another variable to manage, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like you’re managing stress carefully while prioritizing work reliability... Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including those for anxiety, sleep, or muscle tension?

patient: No medications, not formally. I mean, caffeine’s a... work hazard at this point. And maybe a Tylenol at night for the neck tension, but that’s not exactly a treatment plan. My body’s just a cluttered chart of idiopathic fatigue and sympathetic overdrive. I’ve resisted prescriptions though—don’t want another variable complicating reliability. Though sometimes I wonder if my neck would relax if I finally admitted it’s not just ‘stress.’ But that’s probably just overthinking.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness... Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or having ideas that feel unusual or persistent?

patient: I... I don’t hear voices or see things, but my mind feels like it’s on shuffle sometimes. You know how patients present with ‘idiopathic’ symptoms? Well, my brain just... loops. Like, I’ll be in the middle of a chart review and suddenly spiral into Mark’s insurance deadlines or the landlord’s next notice. It’s not exactly *unusual*, just... relentless. My neck’s been tighter since this started, like a brick’s fused there. I guess that’s just my default setting, though. The clinic’s busy, so I can’t afford to let it derail me entirely.

interviewer: It sounds like your mind’s constant looping adds to the physical tension you’re describing... What helps you cope with stress or feel supported when things feel overwhelming?

patient: The sourdough helps, weirdly. Kneading the dough is the only thing that eases this... brick in my neck, even if it’s just for a second. Mark leaves those stupid sticky notes—‘Breathe, not too hard’—but I guilt-scroll them later, wondering if I’m just... failing him. Caffeine’s a shield, I guess. But it’s like my brain’s a broken playlist that won’t skip. I keep thinking I should just be *better* at this. At... not being a human doomsday clock.

interviewer: I appreciate how you’re finding ways to cope through baking and structure... Have you had any periods where you felt unusually driven to achieve a lot or taken risks you wouldn’t normally take, even if it meant ignoring consequences?

patient: No, not really. I’ve been... hyper-focused on work, maybe? Staying late to double-check charts, you know how it is. My neck’s killing me, but it’s just part of the job. Caffeine helps, I guess. Keeps me going. I don’t know if that counts as a risk.

interviewer: It sounds like work is a priority even with the physical strain... Have you been evaluated for any medical conditions that might contribute to your symptoms, like thyroid issues or chronic pain?

patient: My primary care ran blood work last year—thyroid panel, CBC, the usual. Everything was in range. They chalked up my neck pain to ‘occupational strain’ since I’m always hunched over charts. I guess that’s just part of the job, right? Caffeine helps me power through, but… the brick’s still there. Honestly, I avoid thinking about it too much. Mark’s insurance mess is enough to keep my head underwater without imagining some hidden pathology.

interviewer: Let me check if I’ve captured the key pieces: You’ve described persistent anxiety and physical tension—like a 'brick in your neck'—worsening over the past six months, linked to work demands, your partner’s health/financial instability, and childhood patterns of equating stress with performance. You’re struggling with concentration at work, irritability, and sleep, while trying to hold everything together but feeling overwhelmed. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You’re close, but you missed the eviction notice from the landlord. That’s… another brick stacking on top. And maybe the guilt—Mark’s notes are sweet, but I hate that he’s trying to ‘fix’ me. I guess I also don’t mention how my parents just say ‘it’s in your head’ when I try to talk about this. But… yeah, the brick analogy’s spot on.

interviewer: I hear how the eviction notice adds to your load, and it makes sense that guilt and feeling misunderstood by loved ones would compound this. What might help you feel supported right now—would structured problem-solving, exploring emotional patterns, or another approach feel most useful as we move forward?

patient: Structure... it helps, but I keep adding layers to the problem like a cruel intern. My neck feels like it's holding ten bricks now—eviction, Mark's insurance, the... the whole 'reliable person' facade cracking. His sticky notes say 'Breathe, not too hard,' but I'm still stuck in this loop of 'fix it or I'm a burden.' Maybe talking through the... the emotional stuff could help? I just don't trust myself to do it without spiraling into 'what if I fail therapy too?'

interviewer: Let me weave that into a broader picture: You’re managing layers of stress—work demands, financial instability from eviction and Mark’s insurance, and childhood patterns of equating stress with personal failure—that’ve led to physical tension, mental loops of 'fix it or I’m a burden,' and difficulty trusting therapy as a safe space. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You’re closer than I expected. Maybe the part where I... I equate Mark’s stability with my own worth? Like if his insurance is in shambles, it’s because I’m not holding things together. The brick in my neck? It’s not just stress—it’s guilt. And the therapy thing... I keep waiting for you to say ‘just breathe’ like it’s that simple. My brain’s still drafting 20 contingency plans for every ‘what if’ you mention.

interviewer: Let me try another angle: You’re describing how your sense of self-worth feels tied to Mark’s stability—like his insurance struggles reflect a personal failure to ‘hold things together’—and that guilt adds weight to the physical tension you’ve been carrying. The therapy process itself feels like another task to ‘perform’ without clear steps, which fuels the loop of ‘what if I fail this too?’ What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You didn’t miss the guilt, but maybe the... the way I equate *not* fixing everything with being a failure. My neck feels like it’s holding a brick *and* a weightlifting belt now—eviction, Mark’s insurance, the... the silent ‘I told you so’ from my parents when I couldn’t just be the perfect problem-solver. Therapy? It’s like another patient chart—I keep adding ‘complications’ to the diagnosis. ‘What if this intervention backfires?’ ‘What if I’m misreading the lab values?’ You asked if I’m spiraling... I am. But it’s in the small stuff now. Like wondering if Mark’s sticky notes are pity, not love.

interviewer: I hear how the pressure to solve everything perfectly adds to your physical and emotional weight. Would you be open to starting with structured 20-minute check-ins to explore these emotional patterns, while also mapping out concrete steps for the eviction/insurance stressors? What else feels essential to address moving forward?

patient: The 20-minute check-ins... maybe they’ll help. But I keep adding complications, like a cruel intern. The eviction notice is another brick in my neck. If we could map concrete steps for that, it might... it might take some weight off. But I’m still worried I’ll botch this too.

interviewer: I hear how the eviction notice feels like another layer in this already-heavy load, and it makes sense that the therapy process itself feels like a task you might ‘botch.’ Before we map next steps, is there anything else that feels essential to include in this picture of what’s happening for you right now?

patient: There’s the... the caffeine. I guess it’s another way I’m trying to armor up. If I don’t have that shield, the thoughts just... flood in. And I can’t let them see I’m drowning. Not at work, not with Mark. But the coffee’s wearing off faster lately, and I’m just... tired. Not the kind you fix with another cup.

interviewer: I hear how caffeine has become a temporary shield against overwhelming thoughts, but it’s no longer providing the same relief. Before we move forward, would you be open to exploring structured strategies to address both the emotional weight you’re carrying and the physical exhaustion you’re describing? What might feel most helpful to start with?

patient: I… I guess structure sounds better than just drowning in the loop, but my brain already added ten ‘complications’ to the idea. Maybe starting with sleep? Not the sourdough kneading kind, but… actual rest without counting insurance premium deadlines in my head. Though I’ll probably overanalyze the strategy itself into a new brick in my neck. You’ll have to forgive the… constant recalibration.

interviewer: I hear how caffeine’s role as a shield and the eviction notice add layers to your already-heavy load. Before we move forward, is there anything else essential to include in this picture of what’s happening for you right now?

patient: There’s… the eviction notice. I’ve been pushing it down, but it’s another brick piling onto that neck tension. And at work, I freeze during meetings now—my mind goes blank, then I get irritable afterward, snapping over stupid things. It’s like my body’s rebellion against all the mental juggling.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing all of this with me, Claudia. Before we wrap up, is there anything specific you’d like to clarify or carry forward as next steps?

patient: I think... maybe starting with sleep would help, but I’m already second-guessing if I’m approaching it ‘right.’ The eviction thing is there, but I don’t want to... derail us. If we could tackle one thing without my brain adding ten more variables, that might... that might buy me some oxygen.

interviewer: Starting with sleep sounds like a practical step. Would you like to outline a specific next step we can focus on for your sleep?

patient: Maybe… a rigid bedtime routine? Like, not just 'go to bed earlier' but actual steps—no screens by 9:30, maybe a checklist. But I’ll probably obsess over the timing, like 'Is 9:30 too early? What if I can’t fall asleep and it backfires?' My neck already feels like it’s bracing for another brick. And if the eviction thing keeps me awake… it’s a loop. Maybe start with one non-negotiable step? Even if it’s just… turning off my phone? I’ll track it in a journal, though. Data helps, right?

interviewer: That’s a solid starting point—committing to one concrete step can create momentum. Would you be ready to commit to turning off your phone by 9:30 PM this week and tracking it in your journal? Let’s note that as your first step. --FUNCTION-- end_phase --FUNCTION--

patient: I’ll… try it. Maybe start with 9:30, but I’ll probably second-guess if that’s ‘scientific’ enough. The eviction thing still feels like a brick waiting to drop, though—what if that’s the one that cracks the foundation? I’ll track the phone thing, but… my neck already feels like it’s bracing. (Pauses, adjusts scarf.) Though Mark left a note today: *‘Breathe, not too hard.’* Maybe… maybe that’s a start.
