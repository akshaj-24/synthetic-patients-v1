system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Would you prefer to be addressed by your full name, first name, or another name/pronoun?

patient: Traci... but everyone just calls me Traci. My husband insists on Traci Ramos, but I think I’d prefer just Traci here. If that’s okay.

interviewer: Traci, I appreciate you sharing that. This session is meant to understand what’s been going on for you and explore ways to help—does that sound okay to you?

patient: Yes, that sounds... reasonable. I’ve just been trying to figure out how to explain what’s been going on without sounding like I’m making a big deal of it. Most days, I go through the motions, you know? Wake up, check emails, force myself to stay focused. But there are these moments—like last week, when I realized I’d spent an hour just staring at a document without reading a single word—that make me wonder if I’m... slipping.

interviewer: That sounds really tough. Would you be comfortable moving forward with the session?

patient: Yes, I think that’s... necessary. Most days, I just go through the motions, but I guess if talking about it helps make sense of the weight, I’m willing to try. Though I’ll probably ramble about gnomes or something to avoid the real stuff.

interviewer: Thank you for being open about that. Is there anything you'd like to ask or clarify before we begin?

patient: No, I don’t think there’s anything to clarify. I just... hope we can keep things straightforward. I tend to ramble about gnomes or whatever when I get nervous. It’s my brain’s way of avoiding the real stuff, I think.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight of these feelings has been building for some time. Can you tell me when you first started feeling this way?

patient: It’s hard to pinpoint, really. I guess the project getting canceled six months ago was… a big one. Feels like everything since then has been a slow unraveling, you know? I keep thinking maybe I’m just being inefficient, like if I could just organize better or something. But the emails, they just keep piling up. It’s like… the cracks are spreading, but I’m still trying to pretend the glass is whole.

interviewer: That sounds like a significant turning point. How did the project cancellation specifically affect your work performance or daily routine in the months that followed?

patient: Well, my routine… it’s like the gears just stopped meshing. I used to lose track of time working, but now I’m staring at the same email draft for hours, wondering why the font looks off. I catch myself clicking around aimlessly—social media, news sites—anything to fill the quiet. My husband says I’m ‘spacing out’ more, but I just… can’t explain it without sounding like I’m making excuses. The gnomes, though? They’re still standing. Even when mine feel like they’re crumbling.

interviewer: It sounds like the changes in your routine are a significant part of what's been challenging. When did you first notice your routine starting to feel off?

patient: It crept in slowly, really. Maybe around the time the project ended. I started waking up in the middle of the night, staring at my phone. The emails just... pile up. I tell myself it's inefficiency, but it's more like... the edges are blurring. I used to water my plants with purpose. Now I do it just to... check off a task. Even the chardonnay tastes flatter these days, if that makes sense.

interviewer: It sounds like even routine tasks feel like a struggle now. What are you hoping to get out of this therapy?

patient: I guess... I want to feel like I’m not just waiting for the next thing to break. The gnomes, they’re still there, but I keep expecting them to topple. Maybe I want to figure out how to stop expecting everything to crumble. And... if it’s not too much to ask, I’d like to remember what it feels like to actually *do* something, instead of just... going through the motions. My husband deserves more than me nodding along like I’m fine. Even if it’s small, even if it’s slow.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure of maintaining a facade while feeling overwhelmed has been really isolating. When did you first start noticing these feelings of expecting things to crumble, and how have they changed over time?

patient: I think it started when the project ended, but it’s hard to untangle. The gnomes were the first thing I noticed—how their stillness felt like a contrast to my own unraveling. At first, it was just the art initiative, then... another weight settled in. Now it’s like I’m holding my breath, waiting for the next crack. The chardonnay used to steady me, but even that tastes like watered-down patience these days.

interviewer: The gnomes seem to hold a lot of meaning for you—how do they represent what you’re experiencing now compared to how you felt before the project ended?

patient: They just keep standing there, even when the weather beats them down. Before, I guess I saw them as... stable. Now, I notice how many cracks they have. Maybe I relate more to the cracks now. It’s strange—when the project ended, I thought I’d feel more broken. But the gnomes? They’re still up, even if they’re not perfect. I guess I’m... trying to believe that’s possible for me too.

interviewer: It sounds like the project cancellation really impacted your sense of purpose. Have you experienced similar periods in the past where your motivation or mood was significantly affected?

patient: I’ve always had moments where... things feel heavier. As a kid, my parents were really focused on my art—praising in public but critiquing in private. It taught me to second-guess everything. Lately, I just wake up a lot at night. But I’m trying to focus on the gnomes, you know? They’re still there, even with the cracks.

interviewer: It sounds like your parents' mixed feedback shaped how you see your own work. Can you share how that affected your confidence or approach to creative projects over time?

patient: It’s hard to untangle where the self-doubt starts, honestly. My parents always said I was 'efficient' with my art—focused on the rules, the structure. But when you’re taught to second-guess your own instincts, you start editing yourself before you even finish a thought. Now, at work, I’ll reread emails for hours, wondering if I missed something... trivial. It’s like I’m still waiting for the 'but here’s what’s wrong' part of the feedback, even when there is none. My sister’s work... well, she takes risks. I guess I’m still trying to prove that 'safe' can mean something too. It’s just... harder to believe that now.

interviewer: It sounds like trying to prove the value of 'safe' work is really challenging for you. Have you experienced similar periods in adulthood where your motivation or mood was significantly affected?

patient: There was... the time with the community center renovation. The budget kept shifting, and I spent weeks reworking plans no one asked for. I told myself it was just pressure. This feels different. Like the ground’s not just shifting—it’s missing. I catch myself staring at my laptop, wondering if 'efficient' even matters anymore. The gnomes? They’re still standing, but I keep expecting the wind to finally knock them over.

interviewer: It sounds like the community center project really took a toll on your confidence. When you faced that situation, what did you find most helpful in managing those feelings of uncertainty or doubt?

patient: Honestly? I don’t know that I did. I just... kept showing up, I guess. Like the gnomes—standing there even when the rain leaks through the cracks. Some nights, the wine helps me stop rewinding every email. And the succulents... I tell myself if I can remember to water them, maybe I’m not completely broken. It’s not really helping, but it’s something to do that doesn’t require thinking too hard.

interviewer: It sounds like caring for the succulents is one way you're trying to stay grounded. Are there any people in your life who help you feel supported during tough times?

patient: My husband—he tries, I guess. We have routines, like he makes coffee each morning. It’s... efficient. But I don’t want to overstate it. The gnomes? They just keep standing there, really. Even when the cracks spread, they don’t fall.

interviewer: I want to ask about your safety. Have you been having any thoughts about ending your life?

patient: I guess I’ve thought about... the quiet option. But it’s not really a plan. Like the gnomes, they just keep standing there. I don’t want to alarm anyone, including him.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry... Have you been having specific thoughts about how you would do this, even if it doesn’t feel like a real plan right now?

patient: I... I don’t think I’ve gone that far. It’s more like imagining a door being open, but not stepping through. The gnomes—like, even when their cracks spread, they don’t actually fall over. I guess I’m just... waiting for the ground to give way. But I can’t even fix the phone screen, so planning anything concrete? That feels... excessive. My husband keeps saying I’m overthinking, but maybe he’s right. Maybe I’m just inefficient at breaking.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy weight to carry... Have you ever felt like taking steps toward making that door a reality, even if just a small step?

patient: No, not really. It’s more... like checking the hinges on a door that’s already locked. The gnomes would notice, I think. They’re pretty persistent. I guess I’m just... inefficient at breaking things. Even my phone screen survives, cracked as it is.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry... Have you been having any thoughts about wanting to die, even if just briefly?

patient: I guess... I’ve wondered what it would feel like, but it’s more like watching the sunset through a storm. You see the light, but you don’t reach for it. The gnomes... they don’t fall, even when the ground shifts. My husband makes coffee every morning. It’s efficient. I guess that’s enough.

interviewer: From our conversation, it sounds like you've been feeling deeply disconnected from your work and relationships for several months, with sleep disturbances, low motivation, and a sense of being 'cracked' but holding things together. We also talked about how past experiences with parental feedback might be contributing to self-doubt, and how your husband's presence offers some stability. What did I miss or get wrong in that picture?

patient: I think you captured the essentials. Maybe you missed how much I... overcompensate with routine? Like the succulents—I water them every morning, even though they’re clearly past saving. It’s just something to do. And the podcasts... they’re about crime, you know? The way things always resolve, predictably. It’s comforting, in a strange way. Not sure if that matters.

interviewer: It makes sense that routines like caring for your succulents or listening to crime podcasts feel like a way to regain control when everything else feels uncertain. Would you agree with adding that to the picture, or is there something else I’ve missed?

patient: Yes, I think that's right. The podcasts, the plants... they're like my quiet way of keeping score. Even my phone screen—cracked but still working. It's weird how something broken can feel like proof you're still in the game.

interviewer: It sounds like routines like your podcasts and plant care are helping you feel grounded even as things feel fragile. What would you like to explore next in terms of support or changes that could help you feel more in control?

patient: I’m not sure. Maybe... finding a way to work without hating the hours I’m spending there? I keep thinking if I could just make the tasks feel less like they’re... I don’t know, mocking me. And maybe talking to my husband about the gnomes. He laughs, but maybe if I explained why they’re so annoyingly persistent in my head... though I’d probably chicken out. It’s strange, right? Wanting to fix the cracks without fixing myself.

interviewer: It makes sense that wanting to adjust your work experience and communicate with your husband about the gnomes could be important next steps. What other steps feel manageable to take, and is there anything else I haven’t asked about that matters to you?

patient: Maybe... small adjustments, like not forcing myself to water the succulents every single day? Letting them 'rest' if I need to, without feeling like I’m failing. And there’s my dad’s diagnosis. I haven’t brought it up much, but it’s another crack in the glass, I guess. It’s easier to ignore it by overloading with work emails. Not sure how else to... process it. It just is what it is.

interviewer: It sounds like your dad’s diagnosis has been another layer of stress that’s been hard to process. How has this been affecting you, or what does this mean for you right now?

patient: It’s... another stressor, I guess. It’s hard to process without... without feeling like I’m adding to the mess. My dad’s confusion, the way he sometimes doesn’t recognize me—it’s just easier to bury myself in work emails. I’m good at managing, right? Efficient. But some days, I worry I’m just... delaying the inevitable. Like the gnomes. They don’t change, but you keep staring at them, hoping they’ll make sense.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight right now. Would you feel comfortable sharing a bit about what your plan is for managing those moments when the thoughts of feeling overwhelmed or disconnected feel harder to hold?

patient: I... I guess I rely on routines, things that feel predictable. Like watering the succulents every morning, even though they’re barely holding on. And the podcasts—I like that the crimes have clear endings, you know? They give me something to focus on. My husband says I need to 'take breaks,' but sitting still feels safer than... than thinking about everything else. I suppose the wine helps, too. It’s not really a plan, just... accounting for the quiet moments.

interviewer: It sounds like your routines and podcasts are important ways you're managing the quiet moments. Let's talk about next steps for how we can support that moving forward. What would you like to prioritize?

patient: I think... maybe just keeping the structure intact. The succulents, the podcasts—they’re not much, but they’re something I can manage without... overcomplicating it. My husband keeps suggesting new things, like exercise or social stuff, but I’m better off sticking to what works, you know? Even if it’s small. And the wine? It’s not a solution, just... accounting for the taste. I guess I’m afraid if I add too many new pieces, the whole thing might collapse. It sounds trivial, but maybe that’s where I should focus—for now.
