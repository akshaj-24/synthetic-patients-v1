system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Hello, Sarah. My name is Jesse Matthews, and I’ll be conducting this interview with you today. To start, is ‘Sarah’ the name you’d prefer, and are there any pronouns you’d like me to use? Once we have that settled, I’ll briefly explain what to expect from today’s session and check if you’re comfortable proceeding.

patient: Yes, Sarah McKinney. She/her, please. Look, I suppose I should explain I’m a bit… restless today. My clinic had a complicated differential last week—you know, the kind that keeps you up recalculating dosages? It’s nothing, really. I just need to… check the lab results one more time. Would you like me to sign the consent form before we begin?

interviewer: That sounds really tough... Are you comfortable proceeding with today’s session?

patient: Yes, I suppose so. It’s just… the lab results, you know? I need to verify them again. If I can just focus on that, I think I’ll be alright. The differential was so complex—still is, honestly.

interviewer: That sounds really tough... Before we move forward, do you have any questions about what today’s session will involve?

patient: No, I think... everything’s covered in the consent form. Just, you know, the usual protocol. I’ll need to double-check the lab results later, though. My hands are a bit tense—should I... loosen my collar? Helps me focus.

interviewer: Can you tell me more about the concerns that have been most troubling for you lately?

patient: It’s… the usual, I suppose. My clinic’s been swamped with these complicated differentials—lab results that demand precision, you know? I find myself… checking them repeatedly, just to be sure. And then there’s my husband’s brother in hospice. It’s not my place to dwell on it, but I can’t stop overprocessing everything. My hands are always clenched, even when I’m trying to sleep. I wake up exhausted, like my brain’s been running calculations all night. Do you think the lab results might take long to finalize?

interviewer: It sounds like the hospice situation adds to your stress even though you feel it's not your place to dwell on it. When did you first start noticing these worries affecting your daily life?

patient: I suppose it's... you know, it's hard to pinpoint exactly. I've always been meticulous, right? But lately, even routine things—like verifying lab decimals—feel like landmines. The hospice... it's new stress, but the worrying? That's been there forever. You know, like my mother taught me to check every red pen mark... even in margins. I catch myself redoing tasks at work just to... I don't know, quiet the loop? My hands are always clenched at night, trying to 'unworry' but it never sticks.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to be perfect has been a long-standing part of your life, and the hospice situation added new stress. When did you first notice this combination making things harder for you?

patient: I think it's... the past few months, really. The hospice situation has just made the usual... the usual hyper-checking feel even more necessary. I find myself redoing things at work, like lab results, even when I know I've done them right. And my hands—my hands are always clenched, even when I'm trying to sleep. It's like my body can't... relax, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like your body’s tension and need to control details have become overwhelming. Can you share an example of how this has affected your interactions with your husband recently?

patient: I’ve been... short with him sometimes. You know, when he tries to talk about the hospice, I get... I suppose I shut down. My hands clench, and I just start talking about work—labs, dosages, anything to steer clear. He doesn’t push, which I appreciate, but it’s like I’m failing both of us. I mean, he’s the one holding it all together, and I’m just... here, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to manage everything perfectly, which must be exhausting. What are you hoping to achieve through this process?

patient: I suppose... I just want to stop feeling so keyed up all the time. You know, my hands are always clenched, even when I try to sleep. If I could, I guess I’d like to trust that I’m not going to miss a decimal point in a lab result, that I can... relax enough to let the day unfold without checking everything three times. But I don’t know. It feels like if I let my guard down, something will go wrong.

interviewer: It sounds like this pattern of worry has been building for some time. Have you experienced similar episodes of worry or anxiety in the past, and if so, what helped you manage them?

patient: In the past, I’d... I suppose I’d throw myself into work, you know? Like if I focused harder on the labs, the rest would... settle. But now, even that doesn’t quiet it. My hands are still clenched at night, even after a long day. I try the wine, but it’s just... a glass that sits there. Doesn’t really help.

interviewer: Have you used any other substances besides alcohol, such as cannabis, prescription medications, or stimulants, in the past year?

patient: No, not really... I mean, nothing prescription. Maybe some antacids, you know? For the stomach stuff when work’s busy. But that’s it, honestly. (Fidgets with hands, knuckles whitening slightly.) I suppose I could use a sleeping pill sometimes, but I— I don’t like relying on things. It’s just… the labs, the hospice calls, the what-ifs. They keep me up. (Voice cracks imperceptibly.) My husband says I’m overthinking, but how can I not?

interviewer: I hear how overwhelming it feels to carry all that weight. How has your alcohol use been in the past year—has it changed from what you described earlier?

patient: It’s... pretty much the same, I suppose. One glass most nights, just to unwind. But lately, even that feels like it’s not enough. The labs, the hospice calls—they keep me wired. (Pauses, fingers tapping the armrest.) I know I should probably cut back, but how do you choose between that and... (gestures vaguely) everything else? My hands shake if I skip it now. (Forces a tight smile.) You understand, right? It’s just... management.

interviewer: It sounds like the stress from work and personal responsibilities is really taking a toll. Can you tell me about any medications or supplements you're currently taking, including over-the-counter ones like antacids or sleeping pills?

patient: The antacids, yes—I take those when the stomach… tightens up, you know? And maybe a sleeping pill occasionally, though I hate feeling like I need it. (Kneads her temples.) My husband says I overdo it, but how else do I quiet the… the what-ifs? They’re always there, even when I’m trying to rest. (Forces a dry laugh.) It’s just management, right? You understand that part, don’t you?

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure is really weighing on you... Have you had any thoughts about ending your life or harming yourself recently?

patient: No, I haven’t… I mean, not like that. (Pauses, fingers digging into the armrest.) But sometimes when I’m up at 2 a.m. checking lab results again, the weight of it all… (Swallowing hard.) It’s the what-ifs that wear you down, you know? Not the big things, just… the endless decimal points. (Forces a brittle laugh.) My husband says I’m a doctor, not a suicide. He’s probably right.

interviewer: I can see how the pressure of your responsibilities is really weighing on you. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns lately—like feeling unusually energetic or needing less sleep than usual?

patient: Energy? I suppose not as much as I used to. My shoulders are always… clenched, you know? Like they’re holding the weight of every decimal point. Sleep—well, I’m up at 2 a.m. rechecking lab results again. (Forces a tight smile.) My husband says I’m ‘addicted to insomnia,’ but how else do you manage… everything? (Fidgets, hands trembling slightly.) The pills help sometimes, but not enough. You understand, right?

interviewer: It sounds like your mind rarely slows down, even when you're trying to rest. Have you experienced periods where you felt unusually energetic or had a decreased need for sleep, even when you were tired?

patient: I suppose... I’ve been at the office late, you know? Double-checking lab results, recalculating dosages. But it’s just part of the job, right? My husband says I’m ‘addicted to insomnia’—laughs like it’s a joke—but my hands… they’re always clenched, even when I try to sleep. I’ll lie there, mentally revising a patient’s chart instead of… counting sheep. But I’m exhausted, obviously. You can’t function on three hours a night, even if you tell yourself it’s ‘efficiency.’

interviewer: It sounds like your mind rarely slows down, even when you're trying to rest. Have you noticed any unusual thoughts, sensations, or beliefs lately—like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or feeling strongly that something unusual is happening around you?

patient: Unusual thoughts? I suppose not… just the usual storm of decimals and ‘what ifs.’ You know, my mind’s hyper, but it’s always been this way. My hands… they tremble when I try to explain it all. No, nothing *strange*—just the same loops about lab results, hospice calls… the usual. My husband jokes I’m ‘addicted to stress,’ but it’s not like I can just… turn it off.

interviewer: It seems the pressure of your responsibilities is really wearing on you... Have you experienced any periods in the past where you felt unusually energetic or needed significantly less sleep, even when you were tired?

patient: Unusual energy? No, I’m just… exhausted. You know, the lab checks, hospice calls—it’s all so draining. My hands… they’re always trembling, even when I try to rest. I’m not sleeping well, but it’s not like I have the energy to do anything but… keep checking.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly draining to carry that weight constantly. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, like feeling more irritable or restless than usual, even when trying to rest?

patient: I suppose… I’ve been shorter with people lately. You know, the nurses in the clinic, my husband—little things set me off. My hands… they won’t stop fidgeting, even when I’m trying to focus. I’ll start counting decimal points in a lab report just to… calm down. But it’s exhausting. I feel like I’m one missed call away from losing it.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly draining to carry that weight constantly. Have you experienced any periods where you felt you didn’t need as much sleep as usual, even when you were tired?

patient: I suppose… no, I’ve never felt like I *needed* less sleep. It’s more like I can’t shut off the mental noise. You know, the lab results, hospice calls—they follow me into bed. My hands… they’re always twitching even when I’m trying to rest. I’ll lie there recalculating dosages at 2 a.m. until my eyes burn, but it’s not like I *want* to stay up. My body’s just… stuck on overload. My husband jokes I’m ‘addicted to stress,’ but that’s about it.

interviewer: It sounds like your mind rarely slows down, even when you're trying to rest. Have you noticed any changes in your thoughts, like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or feeling strongly that something unusual is happening around you?

patient: No, nothing like that. It’s more... my mind just races, you know? I’ll be going over lab results in my head at night, and my hands... they tremble even when I’m trying to rest. My husband says I’m too hard on myself, but work demands it, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like your mind rarely slows down, even when you're trying to rest. Have you had any medical conditions or issues in the past that might be related to your current symptoms, such as thyroid problems, chronic pain, or sleep apnea?

patient: I suppose... my thyroid was checked a few years back. They said it was normal. I take antacids sometimes, but that’s just stress, right? You know, the pills the hospital gave me after the hospice calls started... well, I maybe still have a few left. But it’s the checking, the rechecking—that’s the real problem, not some test result.

interviewer: It sounds like managing your symptoms with what’s available has been challenging. Can you list all the medications or supplements you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter items like antacids or sleeping pills?

patient: I suppose... antacids, yes, and there are a few sleeping pills left from the hospital. They said my thyroid was fine last time. It’s just... the checking, the rechecking—that’s the real issue, not the pills. I’ve been trying to cut back, but it’s hard when the numbers won’t stop swirling.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure of your responsibilities is really wearing on you... Have you experienced any periods in the past where you felt unusually energetic or needed significantly less sleep, even when you were tired?

patient: I suppose... no. I’m always tired, really. The hospice calls, the labs... they keep me up. My husband jokes I’m addicted to stress, but it’s just the checking, you know? My hands still tremble when I try to fall asleep. There’s no energy—just... the same storm.

interviewer: Sarah, based on our conversation, it sounds like your anxiety has been building for years, worsened recently by the stress of hospice care for your husband’s brother and high-pressure work demands. You’ve managed it by overworking and checking details, but now you’re exhausted, irritable, and struggling to sleep, which is affecting your relationships and medical work. The formulation we’re considering includes longstanding perfectionism, recent stressors, and coping patterns that now feel overwhelming. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You’re not wrong, but you missed the... the decimal points, I guess? How I’ll lie awake at night rewriting patient charts in my head because what if a misplaced comma costs someone their life? And the hospice—it’s not just the calls. My husband’s brother’s chart is in my head too, you know? I keep recalculating his survival odds like it’s a differential I can solve. The pills help, but they’re just... antacids for the anxiety. The real problem is the loop. It never ends.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to avoid even minor errors in patient care, along with the emotional weight of the hospice case, adds a layer of anxiety that’s hard to break free from. What did I miss?

patient: I think what’s… I suppose it’s the way my mind just loops, you know? Even when I’m trying to rest, I catch myself rechecking medication doses in my head. My hands are always clenched at night—my husband jokes I’m ‘training them for a vice grip.’ And the wine… well, it’s not really a vice, just… something to dull the edge of the decimal points, I guess. You know how it is.

interviewer: Sarah, based on our conversation, it sounds like your anxiety is tied to perfectionism and hypervigilance in your work, worsened by the emotional weight of your husband’s brother’s hospice care. You describe mental loops over patient details, physical tension at night, and using wine to cope. The formulation includes longstanding perfectionism, recent stressors, and coping patterns that now feel unmanageable. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: I think you’re… I suppose you’re right about most of it. What I maybe didn’t say enough is how my body’s always tight, even during the day. My shoulders feel like concrete by noon, and my hands… they shake when I write prescriptions. It’s not just the labs at night—it’s like my whole body’s stuck in overdrive. And the wine? It just… it numbs the edge but not the loop. The loop’s always there.

interviewer: It sounds like the physical tension and shaking are adding to the emotional weight you’re carrying, especially with the demands of your work. What did I miss in summarizing how these layers interact?

patient: I think you’re right about the body tension feeding into it all... My legs feel like they’re made of coiled wire by the end of the day—it’s not just my hands. The hospice calls? They’re like... a constant hum in the background, making every decimal point feel like a cliffhanger. The wine helps me fall asleep, but the loop just restarts at 2 a.m. with the same questions. I suppose... I’ve become a walking paradox of ‘I’m fine’ and ‘what if I’m not.’

interviewer: Sarah, based on our conversation, it sounds like your anxiety is tied to physical tension (legs feeling coiled, hands shaking), the emotional weight of hospice care, and mental loops over work details that restart at night despite wine. You’ve described feeling trapped between ‘I’m fine’ and fear of failing yourself or others. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: I think you’re… you’re not wrong, but maybe you missed how the tension isn’t just in my body—it’s in my *thinking*, you know? Like, even when I’m at the clinic, I’ll catch myself double-checking a blood pressure reading and realize I’ve been holding my breath for three minutes. The hospice calls… they’re not just a hum. They’re like a second shift I can’t clock out of. And the wine—well, it’s not that it’s useless, it’s just… it lets me sleep, but the loop’s still there, whispering. I suppose what’s worst is how I convince myself I’m ‘handling it’ until my hands start trembling over a patient’s chart. Then I have to pretend I’m just… you know… precise.

interviewer: Sarah, you’ve described how your anxiety is deeply tied to mental loops over work details, physical tension that doesn’t relax even at rest, and a sense of being trapped between ‘I’m fine’ and fear of failing yourself or others. What would help you feel more supported in breaking free from this cycle?

patient: I suppose… if there was a way to… I don’t know, *pause*… have someone else double-check the decimals for me? Just so I could stop… holding my breath every time. And maybe… you know… if the hospice calls didn’t feel like they were happening *through* me, like I had to solve everyone’s grief at the same time as their lab results. But that sounds selfish. What helps most is when my husband says, ‘The charts can wait,’ even though I hate letting them sit. My hands still shake over the pen, though… you know how it is.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight of holding everything together—both the decimal points and the emotional burden of hospice—has become unsustainable, even with your husband’s support. What did I miss in summarizing how these layers contribute to the cycle you’re describing?

patient: It’s… the way the hospice calls bleed into my work hours, you know? I’ll be charting a patient’s blood pressure and suddenly fixate on whether the nurse called about Mr. Thompson’s morphine dose last night. My hands clench so hard I think I’ll snap the pen… then I have to double-check *everything* just to shake the knot in my shoulders. And the antacids—my husband jokes I’m addicted to them, but it’s the loops, right? What if I missed a symptom? What if… it’s all just… tangled.

interviewer: Sarah, based on our conversation, it sounds like the hospice calls are creating a relentless backdrop that intrudes on your work focus, fueling loops of overchecking and physical tension. You’ve described a cycle where even small tasks feel high-stakes, and coping strategies like wine or antacids offer only fleeting relief. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: It’s the way… the way my hands can’t stop trembling even when I’m trying to focus. You know? Like, even when I’m at home, my fingers are always… clenched. And the antacids—my husband’s right, I probably take them too much, but what else am I supposed to do when the loops won’t stop? It’s like… like the hospice calls and the lab results are both screaming for attention, and I’m just… trying to keep up without missing a decimal point. Even when I know I’m overdoing it, I can’t stop. You know?

interviewer: Sarah, based on our conversation, it sounds like your anxiety is deeply intertwined with physical tension (clenched hands, trembling), mental loops over work details, and the emotional weight of hospice care—creating a cycle where even small tasks feel high-stakes. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: I suppose… you didn’t mention how the weight of it all makes my shoulders ache, like they’re carrying the whole hospital on one side and the hospice files on the other. You know? And the wine—well, it’s just… it’s not really a vice, is it? It’s more like a… a doctor’s right to one thing that doesn’t require double-checking. But you’re right about the loops. I’ll fixate on a lab result at 2 a.m., then snap back to a hospice call and forget my own name for a second. It’s all just… tangled.

interviewer: The weight you’re carrying—both physically and emotionally—sounds incredibly heavy, especially with the overlapping demands of your work and the hospice care. What would you most want to address or change as we think about next steps for support?

patient: I suppose… I’d want to stop feeling like my hands are always in a vice grip, you know? Even when I’m not at work, they’re clenched. And the loops—what if there’s a way to… quiet them long enough to actually rest? Not just with wine, but… I don’t know. I keep thinking if I could just organize the hospice notes better, maybe the rest would untangle. But it’s not like that, is it?

interviewer: Sarah, based on our conversation, it sounds like your anxiety is deeply connected to physical tension (clenched hands, trembling), mental loops over work and hospice details, and a need to regain control through meticulous organization. What would be most helpful for us to prioritize next—exploring strategies to quiet the mental loops, addressing the physical tension, or another approach?

patient: I suppose… if there’s a way to loosen the grip on my hands without… without making me feel like I’m losing control? Because the loops—they just… they follow the tension, you know? If I could untangle even one thread, maybe the rest would quiet down. But how do you fix something that’s part of the job, part of being a doctor? You can’t just… stop double-checking, can you?

interviewer: That sounds really challenging—holding so much together while the loops keep tightening. If we were to start untangling one thread, would you prefer to focus first on strategies to ease the physical tension in your hands and body, or on addressing the mental loops around work and hospice details?

patient: I suppose… if we had to pick, the physical tension is the most obvious thread, you know? My hands are always clenched, even when I’m trying to rest. It’s like my body’s stuck in this… problem-solving mode. But honestly, the hospice calls and the lab results—they all braid together. I can’t untangle them without feeling like I’m dropping something. Maybe starting with the hands would help me stop checking those decimal points at 2 a.m.

interviewer: It makes sense to start with what feels most tangible—the clenched hands and body tension. What strategies or support would you most want to explore first to address that physical tightness and its connection to the mental loops?

patient: I suppose… I’ve tried progressive muscle relaxation before, but it feels like telling a storm to calm down. My hands still clench when I’m on the phone with hospice, you know? Maybe if there was a way to… untangle the checking from the actual task? Like, a structured approach to let go of the decimals after a certain point. But I don’t know if that’s even possible when the what-ifs are part of the same… system.
