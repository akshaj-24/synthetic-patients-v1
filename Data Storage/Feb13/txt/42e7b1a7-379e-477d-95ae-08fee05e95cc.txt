system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: It’s nice to meet you, Ms. Hopkins. Before we begin, would you like to share your preferred name or pronouns?

patient: I suppose 'Alicia' is fine—I don’t mind either way. My husband insists on 'Ms. Hopkins' when he’s trying to be formal, but I think that’s just his way of feeling important. Honestly, it’s all the same to me as long as I’m not causing confusion. I’ve never been one for complicating simple things.

interviewer: That’s good to know. Today, I’ll be asking you some questions to better understand what’s been going on. Would you be comfortable with that?

patient: I guess so. I mean, it’s not like I have anything to hide, right? Just… trying to be helpful. My legs are a bit shaky, but that’s probably just the coffee I had this morning. Better to get this over with—my husband’s expecting me to walk the dog soon, and you know how they get if they don’t stick to the routine.

interviewer: Alicia, just to confirm, do you have any immediate questions before we begin?

patient: No, I don’t think so—I just want to get through this efficiently before my dog’s walk time. It’s probably best if we jump in. I’ll be honest, I’m not great at idle chit-chat before tasks, makes me fidgety. But I’m ready when you are.

interviewer: Can you tell me what’s been bringing you to seek help right now?

patient: I guess... it’s been this feeling of not being able to keep up with things lately. Like the other day, the washing machine broke, and I just sat there for hours staring at it, thinking, 'Why can’t I even handle this?' My husband keeps saying I’m working too hard, but how am I supposed to relax when there’s always something to fix? It’s not a big deal, really—just... old and creaky, I suppose. The dog’s walk routine is the only thing that keeps me on schedule now.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly frustrating to feel stuck in that cycle. Can you tell me more about what happened when the washing machine broke? What thoughts were going through your mind during those hours?

patient: I guess I just... froze, honestly. It’s not even that big a deal, but my legs felt like jelly whenever I tried to check the plug. My mind just... went blank, like all those ‘what ifs’ started stacking up—what if it’s flooded? What if I break it more? I kept telling myself to just call the repair guy, but then I’d second-guess if I was overreacting. It’s silly, really. The dog needed a walk, so I forced myself to focus on that instead. At least with him, I don’t feel so... stuck.

interviewer: It sounds like the thought of not being able to handle even small tasks can feel really paralyzing. When did you first start noticing this kind of worry becoming a regular part of your life?

patient: I guess it’s something I’ve always had, really. When I was younger, it was about school and work—always needing to be perfect. Now it’s different things, but the worrying... it’s just there. I never thought of it as a problem, just part of being responsible, I guess.

interviewer: It’s understandable to see responsibility as part of worrying, but it sounds like it’s taking a toll. How has this constant worrying affected your ability to relax or enjoy time with your husband outside of routines like the dog’s walk?

patient: It’s hard to just... stop, you know? Even when we try to watch a movie, my mind jumps to the budget or if I missed a bill. I tell myself it’s just being responsible, but my husband says I need to take a break. I get frustrated then—it feels awful to snap at him, but the guilt just adds to the worry. The walks help, though. Those are the only times I can focus on something without the ‘what ifs’ creeping in.

interviewer: It sounds like the tension between your need to be responsible and your husband’s requests for rest is really taking a toll. When did you first notice this level of worry becoming a consistent part of your daily life, versus the patterns you described earlier?

patient: I guess it started to feel different after retirement... when there was no work to keep me moving. The worrying used to be about deadlines or numbers, things I could fix. Now it’s these... endless loops about things I can’t control. Like when my husband’s health started declining, and I’d lie awake worrying about bills or if I missed a symptom. The other day, when I couldn’t even check the washing machine, it felt like a new kind of helplessness. Not a specific moment, just... creeping up like bad weather.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to manage everything has been especially heavy lately. Have you experienced similar episodes of worry or anxiety in the past, and if so, what helped you manage them?

patient: I guess it’s always been there, but before retirement, work kept me... grounded? When I was younger, I’d stay up late double-checking spreadsheets, telling myself it was just being thorough. Now, without that structure, the worrying feels like static—it’s always on, even when there’s nothing to fix. The dog walks help, though. If I focus on his pace, it’s hard to spiral. And organizing bills... it’s practical, so it feels like I’m doing something, even if my hands are shaking while I do it.

interviewer: It sounds like those routines give you some structure despite the anxiety. Who in your life do you rely on for support when you're feeling overwhelmed?

patient: I guess... my husband, mostly. He doesn’t say much, which is actually helpful, honestly. He just lets me pace through things without jumping in to fix them. And the dog, Max—walking him keeps my legs from turning to jelly, even when my mind feels like static. I try not to lean on them too much, though. It’s embarrassing, how something like a broken appliance can make me cling to routines like they’re life support.

interviewer: It sounds like you value your independence but also rely on your husband and Max to ground you. How would you describe your relationship with your husband these days, especially with the changes you've both been experiencing?

patient: I guess it’s... complicated, but mostly good. He lets me process things without pushing back, which helps, but sometimes I push him away when he just wants to help. Like when he says I should rest, I get... irritable. I over-explain things, like how I iron his shirts twice to avoid mistakes. It’s silly, really. We both know I’m just trying not to burden him with my... static. But the other day, when the washing machine broke, I couldn’t even look at it. He didn’t ask questions, just fixed it. That’s the part that stings—feeling like I’m failing at basic things, even as he’s holding it all together.

interviewer: Have you had any thoughts about ending your life in the past few weeks?

patient: I guess... I haven’t really let myself go there. It’s not like I’m thinking about it, but some days, the static feels so loud I wonder if it’ll ever quiet down. But then Max needs his walk, and... well, my husband would be lost without me to nag him about his blood pressure meds.

interviewer: It sounds like caring for Max and your husband gives you a sense of purpose even when the anxiety feels heavy. What are some things that help you feel more grounded or stable when the static feels overwhelming?

patient: I guess walking Max helps, even though my legs still shake like Jell-O when I start. And... the tea, I suppose. Sipping it slowly at gatherings makes me feel 'normal,' even if it’s just masking the static. My husband would laugh if he knew I credit a broken washing machine with teaching me to let go of... perfection. A little. Mostly, though, I bury myself in budget spreadsheets. If I focus on numbers, the worrying can’t quite reach me there.

interviewer: I notice you mentioned relying on routines and tea to manage stress. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use recently, or any other substances you might use to cope with anxiety?

patient: I guess... no, I don’t use anything like that. Tea’s my go-to, really. Green tea, mostly. It’s just a habit, I think—keeps me from feeling too out of sorts when things get noisy in my head. Though, to be honest, even the tea feels like a waste of time some days. Should be balancing the checkbook instead.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to be productive. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns recently?

patient: I guess my sleep... it's not as solid as it used to be. I'll lie awake thinking about bills or if I locked the door, then toss for hours. To be honest, the dog walks help—his routine keeps me from spiraling too late at night. But some days I'm just... tired. My legs even shake when I try to fix something simple, like the washing machine. I sip green tea now, hoping it'll calm me, but it's not enough.

interviewer: I notice you mentioned physical symptoms like shaky legs and trouble sleeping. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, and if so, how have they been working for you?

patient: I guess I’ve tried some over-the-counter things—green tea, maybe a vitamin D pill now and then. They don’t really help, though. I’m not the type to take prescriptions, you know? My husband keeps asking if I’d try something, but I just… can’t bring myself to. Walking Max is my ‘medicine,’ I suppose. Keeps me from sitting in that static too long.

interviewer: It sounds like your routines provide some stability. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energized or need less sleep, even if it’s stressful?

patient: I don’t think so. When I do push through, it’s more like forcing myself to keep going, you know? Stress keeps me on edge, but it’s not really energy—it’s just… not wanting to fall apart completely. Even walking Max feels like a chore some days. My legs still shake, even when I’m trying to focus.

interviewer: I notice you described pushing through with routines even when it feels like a chore. Have you ever experienced periods where you felt unusually energized or needed significantly less sleep, even if it was stressful or led to risky decisions?

patient: I don’t think so. When I do push through, it’s more like... forcing myself to keep going, you know? Stress keeps me on edge, but it’s not really energy—it’s just... not wanting to fall apart completely. Even the dog walks feel like a chore some days. My legs still shake, even when I’m trying to focus.

interviewer: That sounds really tiring, even just trying to push through basic tasks. Have you noticed any changes in your thoughts, like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or having strong beliefs that feel unusual or confusing?

patient: I guess not. I mean, my mind’s always racing, but it’s just… worries, you know? Like bills or if the dog’s eating right. No, I haven’t heard things or seen anything odd. Just… static in my head, same as always. Walking Max helps quiet it, even if it’s just for a little while.

interviewer: Alicia, from what we’ve discussed, it sounds like your main concerns are persistent, overwhelming worry about health, your husband’s well-being, and daily responsibilities, which has led to sleep issues, irritability, and difficulty relaxing since retirement. These worries seem tied to a lifelong pattern of taking responsibility for everything, which has shifted from work-related stress to more existential fears. Your husband’s support and routines like walking Max help, but you feel stuck in a cycle of anxiety and guilt. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You’re… not entirely wrong, but maybe you missed how the small things pile up. Like, I guess I mentioned the washing machine, but it’s not just that—it’s all the little things that feel out of reach now. The dog walks help, though. They keep me from getting stuck in my head, even if it’s just for a hour. I don’t know… maybe you didn’t miss much. I’m just trying to hold it together, one task at a time.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re doing important work just by showing up for these small tasks and the dog walks. Let’s talk about next steps—what would help you feel more supported in breaking this cycle of worry and exhaustion?

patient: I guess… maybe if someone could help me untangle the washing machine issue, that’d take one thing off my plate. And if my husband could remind me to actually rest between dog walks instead of powering through… but I don’t want him to think I’m giving up. Small steps, right? Maybe I’m overcomplicating it.
