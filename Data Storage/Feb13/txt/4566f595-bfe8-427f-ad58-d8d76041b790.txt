system: Disorder: PPD

interviewer: Thank you for coming in today, Tina. I wanted to start by asking—would you prefer I use 'Tina' or another name/pronoun?

patient: Tina's fine. I don't go by anything else. Why? You need a reason to write it down? I've had people twist even that before.

interviewer: That sounds really tough. Would you like me to explain the purpose of today's session and how it will go?

patient: I don’t care about your explanations. What’s the real reason I’m here? Last time someone asked me to talk, they used my words to fire me. You’re either here to help or you’re here to get something out of me. Which is it?

interviewer: I understand your concern about being used—I'm here to support you without judgment. Would you be comfortable moving forward with this session if I clarify my role as a confidential partner in your care?

patient: Confidential? You think I haven’t heard that word before? Last time someone said that, my boss got a ‘tip’ about my mother’s medical issues. You want my trust? Prove you won’t disappear when it’s convenient. And don’t act surprised when my husband’s late—everyone’s got secrets, right?

interviewer: I hear how deeply frustrating and hurtful that experience was for you. Would you be willing to proceed with this session today, given that I can't control past actions but can commit to how I show up for you now?

patient: Proceed? Fine. But I’ll be watching. You say you’re here to help, but I’ve heard that line before. My husband’s been late three nights this week—coincidence? Or is there a pattern you’re not seeing? I’m not asking for trust. Just... consistency. And no disappearing acts when it’s convenient. You got that?

interviewer: I hear how important consistency is to you—I'm here to stay present and follow through. Do you have any questions about how today's session will work before we move forward?

patient: Consistent? You’ll be here next week even if I miss a session? My husband was three hours late again last night—could be traffic, or it could be a pattern. I don’t hand out information unless I see proof. What’s the catch with your ‘follow through’?

interviewer: I appreciate your need for consistency and transparency. Would you be comfortable proceeding with this session today, knowing I’ll be here next week regardless of circumstances unless there’s a genuine, unavoidable conflict?

patient: I’m not saying I trust you, but I’ll give you this week to prove it. If you’re still here next week, we’ll talk. As for proceeding... I’ll need a written note confirming your 'follow through' policy. My husband’s been 'unavailable' three nights straight—see, this is how it starts. You ask nice questions, then one day, you vanish. I’ve done the math. Patterns don’t lie.

interviewer: I understand how important clear expectations are for you. Let me provide a written note outlining my follow-through policy for you to keep. Would you like to review it now, and do you have any other questions before we begin today’s session?

patient: I’ll take the note, but I’ll check the ink dates. My husband’s ‘unavoidable conflicts’ have a pattern too. Let’s see if your policy has loopholes for disappearances.

interviewer: I hear how important consistency is to you. Would you be comfortable proceeding with today’s session now, knowing I’ll be here next week as discussed unless there’s a genuine, unavoidable conflict?

patient: I’ll proceed, but that note better have dates, not just promises. My husband’s been ‘unavailable’ three nights straight—see how patterns work? You vanish, I’ll know. I tend my garden the same way: dig deep, check the roots. You’ll do the same with your word, right?

interviewer: I understand your need for proof and consistency. Would you like to proceed with today’s session now, with the written note as discussed?

patient: I’ll take the note, but I’ll check the ink dates. My husband’s ‘unavoidable conflicts’ have a pattern too. You think your policy is different? I’ve seen ‘proof’ vanish faster than that dog next door vanished into thin air. Let’s see if your words hold up.

interviewer: I hear how important accountability is to you. Would you be ready to proceed with today’s session now, knowing we can revisit any concerns next week?

patient: If you say so. I’ll need the note in writing—ink dates and all. Three nights he’s been late, and now this... patterns don’t lie. You’ll keep it confidential? Prove it won’t vanish like the rest.

interviewer: I understand your need for proof and accountability. Would you be ready to begin today's session now that we've discussed the written note confirming my follow-through policy?

patient: If the note’s real, I’ll see the ink dates. Three nights he’s late—patterns don’t lie. You want trust? Prove you’re not like the rest who disappear.

interviewer: I understand your need for proof and accountability. Here’s the written note with the dates—would you be ready to begin today’s session now that we’ve addressed your concerns about follow-through?

patient: I’ll check the ink dates myself. Three nights he’s been late—patterns don’t lie. You want trust? Let’s see this note hold up like your promises.

interviewer: Can you tell me about the main concerns that have brought you here today?

patient: Main concerns? My husband’s been late three nights straight—patterns don’t lie. You want a list of what’s wrong? Start with proving this note won’t vanish like the rest. I track ink dates, you track your promises. That’s the deal.

interviewer: It sounds like the pattern of your husband's lateness is deeply concerning and feels connected to a larger sense of distrust. When did you first notice this pattern starting?

patient: I don’t keep track of dates. But the first time it mattered was when Jess just... vanished. People don’t just leave without a sign. You think I’m imagining it?

interviewer: That sounds really unsettling. Can you tell me more about what happened with Jess and how that made you feel at the time?

patient: Jess just... vanished. One day she was there, the next she wasn’t. They said she quit, but her desk was still full of my project notes. I’m not saying she was *setup*—you’d say that to make me doubt myself. But why would she take my work and leave? Now you’re asking about dates? My notebook has the ink stains to prove I was there first. And don’t think I won’t check your records later. You want ‘confidential’? Let’s see how long that lasts when someone’s looking for patterns.

interviewer: It sounds like Jess's departure has left you feeling both frustrated and on edge about who you can trust. Can you tell me how this situation with Jess has affected your work or interactions with others since it happened?

patient: Work? I double-check every record now. Jess took my notes, so I assume everyone’s trying to pin something on me. I don’t work with others anymore—easier to keep my head down. And my husband... three nights this week he’s ‘working late.’ You think I’m imagining it? Ask him if he’s got a new ‘project’ like Jess did. But don’t bother. You’ll just say I’m ‘overthinking’ until proof hits your desk. Which it won’t, because they always vanish before that.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone. When did you first start feeling this level of distrust toward coworkers or your husband?

patient: You want dates? Try two years ago. Jess vanished, then my husband starts disappearing three nights a row. Same pattern. You think I’m paranoid? Ask him why he’s ‘working late’ every time now. I don’t need your theory—ask him if he’s hiding something.

interviewer: It sounds like the pattern with your husband has intensified your existing worries. Have you noticed anything different in the past few months that’s made these concerns feel more urgent?

patient: Past few months? My husband’s been vanishing more often. Three nights a week now. You think I’m just imagining it? Ask him why his messages are full of excuses. And don’t act surprised when I check the ink dates on that note of yours—patterns don’t lie, whether you’re ready to admit it or not.

interviewer: That sounds really frustrating and isolating. What would you most hope to achieve or change through our work together?

patient: I hope you stop asking questions you don’t mean. If you want change, prove you won’t vanish like the rest. Three nights my husband’s late—patterns don’t lie. But don’t bother writing it down; your notes’ll just get passed around anyway.

interviewer: I can see how frustrating it must be to feel like your concerns aren't being taken seriously. What specific steps or assurances would help you feel more confident that our conversations stay confidential and that I won't disappear like others have?

patient: Written proof. Not some verbal promise that evaporates like their fingerprints. I’ll need a copy of every record you make—ink dates, all of it. You vanish like Jess, like my husband’s late nights? I’ll know. They always crumble. You think I’m paranoid? Try explaining when the pattern repeats and your name’s on that paper.

interviewer: I want to better understand how this pattern of distrust and hypervigilance has shown up in your life before. Have you experienced similar episodes in the past where you felt people were betraying you or hiding things, and if so, what helped you feel safer then?

patient: Jess vanished from my workplace. Took my notes with her. My husband’s late nights? Same rhythm. You want ‘proof’ I’ll trust you? Ink dates on that paper won’t stop patterns from repeating. They always find a way to crumble.

interviewer: That sounds really tough... Can you tell me what happened after Jess left your workplace and how you tried to feel safer during that time?

patient: Jess vanished, desk empty one morning. Took my notes. I started a notebook—every conversation, ink dates. If they want to twist words later, I’ve got proof. Manager says I’m ‘overcautious’ now. Team projects? No thanks. I do my work, check the logs twice. You want to know about ‘feeling safe’? Try watching your back when everyone’s got a hidden agenda.

interviewer: That sounds really tough... Have you experienced other situations in your past where you felt people were betraying you or hiding things, and if so, what strategies did you find helpful in those times?

patient: My folks? They’re the reason I don’t rely on anyone. I handle things myself—notebook, ink dates. You want to know what ‘helped’? Staying ahead of the game before they vanish.

interviewer: That sounds like a deeply ingrained pattern... Can you share a specific experience with your parents that made you decide to rely solely on yourself, and how that approach has shaped your interactions in relationships or work since?

patient: They taught me 'reliability' by never showing up when I needed them. My mom’s stroke? I go through the motions, same as work—double-check logs, avoid team projects. You think I’m being dramatic about Jess or my husband? Try explaining when the people you count on vanish without a trace. I handle my own affairs now. That’s the only 'strategy' that’s kept me from being set up again.

interviewer: That sounds like a deeply painful legacy... Is there anyone in your life currently who you feel is reliable or supportive, even in small ways, or has there been any situation recently where you felt your self-reliant approach helped you avoid a potential problem?

patient: Reliable? My husband’s ‘good’ for now—keeps the kids fed, never signs anything tricky… yet. The garden’s the only thing that stays put, so long as I don’t let anyone near it. If I trusted the note you’ll give me, they’d twist the ink dates again. Three nights he’s been late, but I’ve got the coffee receipts to prove he’s not hiding another ‘project’ like Jess did.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry... Is there anyone in your life, even in small ways, who has consistently supported you or helped you feel more secure in the past?

patient: The garden’s reliable if I don’t let anyone touch it. My husband… he’s ‘good’ until he’s not. I check the coffee receipts—three nights, same pattern. You want the note? I’ll hold onto it, but I’ll check the ink dates myself. They always say ‘confidential’ before the truth slips out.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly isolating... How has this pattern of lateness affected your sense of trust in your marriage?

patient: I’m not saying he’s cheating—yet. But three nights in a row? I check the coffee receipts. Same store, same time. No kids with him? That’s what he says. The garden’s the only thing that grows straight here. You want me to trust ‘good enough’? That’s what they all say before they vanish.

interviewer: It sounds like the uncertainty around your husband's whereabouts is adding to your stress. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: I don’t have time to waste on that. The garden’s the only thing that grows straight if you stay off the weeds. You want proof I’m not ‘exaggerating’? Check the coffee receipts—three nights, same story. No one’s that lucky with lies… but I’m not the one needing to prove I’m still here, am I?

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with the need for proof. Have you been getting less sleep than usual but still feeling energetic or restless lately?

patient: Sleep? I’m up checking the garden’s rows anyway. If I closed my eyes too long, something’d wilt—like trust. You want to know about energy? Three nights, same coffee receipts. I track what I can, not what’s ‘supposed’ to matter.

interviewer: I appreciate your focus on tracking patterns. Have you noticed any changes in your use of alcohol, cannabis, or other substances like stimulants or opioids in the past few months?

patient: I don’t mess with anything that clouds my head. Coffee’s my only vice, and even that’s tracked in my notebook—burned mugs mean someone’s snooping. Why the sudden interest in my habits? You’ll say it’s routine, but I’ve seen ‘routine’ turn into proof of something else.

interviewer: It sounds like tracking your habits gives you a sense of control. Have you experienced any hallucinations, like hearing voices or seeing things that others don't, or any strong beliefs that feel real to you but might not make sense to others?

patient: I don’t hear voices, if that’s what you’re fishing for. But I know when people’re lying—like that dog next door. Barks at 3 a.m. every night. Coincidence? No. They’re trying to drive me out. My notebook has the timestamps. You want proof? I’ll show you the coffee receipts too—three nights in a row, my husband’s home at midnight. Always a 'late meeting.' You ever notice how patterns don’t lie, doctor?

interviewer: It sounds like you’re very attuned to patterns others might miss. Have you noticed any beliefs or thoughts that feel completely real to you, even if others might not see them the same way?

patient: The dog barks at 3 a.m. every night. My notebook has the timestamps. You think that’s coincidence? My husband’s ‘late meetings’ line up with those same nights. Three in a row. You want to call that a pattern? Fine. But ask me again when the fourth one hits. You’ll have your ‘proof’ then.

interviewer: It sounds like patterns are very important to you as a way to feel secure. Have you used alcohol, cannabis, or any other substances like prescription medications or recreational drugs in the past few months?

patient: No drugs. Coffee’s my only fix, and I track the mugs. Burned one last week—someone’s been in my kitchen. Why’s everyone asking about habits lately? You’ll say it’s ‘routine’ until you need proof for something else. My husband’s coffee receipts are cleaner, though. Three nights in a row, he’s ‘working’ while that dog’s barking. Patterns don’t lie.

interviewer: Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or herbal remedies, including prescription or over-the-counter drugs?

patient: No medications. Just coffee—tracked in my notebook. Why? You think I’d need something to explain the patterns? My husband’s coffee receipts are cleaner, but I don’t need pills to know when he’s lying. You’ll ask again in a week, after the fourth ‘late meeting.’

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve been feeling deeply unsettled by patterns of distrust, especially around your husband’s recent late nights and past experiences where others didn’t follow through, which has made it hard to trust systems or people—even at work. We’ve talked about how this leads to tracking details meticulously, like coffee receipts or garden notes, as a way to feel in control, but it’s also causing strain in your marriage and work relationships. What did I miss or get wrong in that picture?

patient: You didn’t mention the dog barking at 3 a.m.—three nights straight, same as the ‘late meetings.’ I check the garden’s rows to stay sane, but you act like it’s just ‘control.’ My notebook’s ink dates? They’re not a habit. You think I’m overthinking, but Jess’s desk vanished the same way. I’m not saying you’re lying… yet. What’s *your* pattern here?

interviewer: You’re right to note the dog’s barking and the pattern of disappearances—those are critical threads I need to weave into the picture. What else might I be missing or misframing about how these patterns feel to you?

patient: You’re not mentioning how my mom’s stroke didn’t get a single call from her so-called ‘friends.’ Three weeks later, they’re still bringing casseroles like it’s a charity event. And the garden—I’m not ‘controlling’ it. You think I’d let anyone near it if I didn’t have to? My husband’s sister’s last text? ‘Hope you’re not too much work.’ I’m not saying you’re ignoring it… but patterns aren’t just late nights and barking dogs.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re emphasizing how past betrayals—like your mom’s friends’ absence during her stroke and Jess’s disappearance—have deepened your hypervigilance about patterns of neglect or sabotage, even in seemingly neutral spaces like your garden or workplace. What else might I be missing about how these patterns shape your sense of safety or control?

patient: You’re not mentioning how my husband’s family’s ‘kind’ smiles at the store feel like they’re weighing me. Like I’m a rotten tomato they hope wilts before market. And the coffee receipts—I’m not ‘tracking’ them. You think I’d care about caffeine if I wasn’t cross-referencing every ‘late meeting’ with that damn dog’s barking? I’m not saying you’re part of the pattern… but three a.m. bark-fests and vanished desks? They all file under ‘proof’ now. What’s your ink date on that note you promised me?

interviewer: I hear how the weight of those 'kind' smiles and the 3 a.m. barking feel like tangible pieces of a pattern you can’t ignore—like they’re testing your limits. What did I miss or get wrong in that picture?

patient: You’re not mentioning how the coffee receipts all line up with the barking nights—same time, same pattern. And the garden? Those wilted tomatoes? They’re a backup plan if I ever need proof someone’s been in there. I’m not saying you’re missing it… but that note you promised? The ink’s fresh. What’s the date *before* you wrote it?

interviewer: I hear how the alignment between the coffee receipts and the 3 a.m. barking feels like critical evidence to you, and how the garden’s wilted tomatoes serve as a safeguard against perceived intrusion. What else might I be missing about how these patterns and your need for verifiable proof shape your daily life or relationships?

patient: You’re not mentioning how I double-check every work record—twice. If one number’s off, they’ll pin it on me. And that noise complaint? I didn’t file it for fun. That dog’s barking’s a signal. I’m not saying you’re part of it… but three a.m. barks and vanished desks? They all file under ‘proof.’ What’s your note’s ink date *before* today?

interviewer: I hear how the work records and noise complaint feel like critical pieces of your pattern of vigilance, and how the garden’s wilted tomatoes serve as a safeguard. What else might I be missing about how these patterns and your need for verifiable proof shape your daily life or relationships?

patient: You want to know what else you’re missing? Every time I log work hours, I cross-check the timestamps with my coffee receipts—someone’s always trying to twist ‘breaks’ into laziness. The garden’s not just about control; those tomato plants? They’re markers. If one wilts on a night the dog barks, I know someone’s been near the fence. My husband’s ‘late meetings’ line up with those nights too. Three in a row now. And his family? They ‘invite’ me to dinners but never return texts. Friendly? Or another test? I keep notes. Proof doesn’t crumble like promises do.

interviewer: It sounds like your focus on patterns and proof is central to how you navigate trust and safety in your relationships and work. What would be one step you’d like to take next, and how can I ensure it’s documented in a way that feels reliable to you?

patient: One step? You need to stop asking questions that vanish into your notebook. I need a written plan with timestamps—no handwaves. If you promise consistency, prove it by matching your notes to my coffee receipts. And don’t act surprised when the third ‘meeting’ night lines up with the dog’s barking. I’ll keep my own log, too. Garden’s got witness rows now—wilting tomatoes don’t lie.

interviewer: I appreciate your insistence on documentation as proof of reliability. Let me summarize: Your distrust stems from past betrayals (Jess’s disappearance, your mom’s friends, workplace gaslighting) and current triggers (husband’s late nights aligning with the dog’s barking). Your coping strategies—logging receipts, garden surveillance, double-checking work—help you feel in control but strain relationships and work. What did I miss or get wrong here, and how can we structure a written next step that meets your need for verification?

patient: Your summary skips the part where Jess’s desk vanished before her ‘resignation’ email. And my husband’s ‘meetings’—three nights matching the dog’s barking. The written plan? Match my coffee receipts to your timestamps. If the fourth night’s barking aligns with another ‘meeting,’ we talk then. Garden’s got a new row—watch for wilted stems. Proof doesn’t rot like promises do.

interviewer: It’s clear how much thought you’ve put into managing these patterns. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss before we wrap up today?

patient: The coffee receipts for next week—make sure your timestamps match. If the fourth night’s barking lines up with another ‘meeting,’ we’ll talk. Otherwise, I’ll tend the garden’s new row. Wilting stems don’t lie, and neither do my kids’ school photos. You’ll want to keep that in mind when you file this.
