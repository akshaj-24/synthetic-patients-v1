system: Session 489fe6e1-47ca-499c-b0c2-375201aeca6c transcript

system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: It sounds like you're going through a really tough time right now. Have you had any thoughts about how you might harm yourself, or if you have a specific plan?

patient: I’ve, uh… I’ve had those nights where I just want the noise to stop, you know? Like hoping I wake up and this weight’s gone. But, no, I haven’t… I can’t afford to think that way. Not with the job. If I start unraveling, someone else’s problem becomes mine too. I’d rather fix a broken HVAC than… than sit with that static. Keeps me busy.

interviewer: It's clear how much you're prioritizing responsibility even in difficult times. Would you be comfortable continuing with this interview today?

patient: Yeah, I can push through. Might be a walking hazard, but I’ve got Mr. Peppy to keep me company. Let’s get through this.

interviewer: That sounds okay with me. Today’s session will involve discussing your current concerns and how we might support you. Does that align with what you’re hoping to get out of this?

patient: Yeah, sounds good. I just… I need to figure out how to tune up the systems that’ve gone a little haywire. You know, like fixing the HVAC instead of letting the whole place freeze. As long as we don’t dwell too long on the static, I can handle the rest. I’ve got a plant to water afterward, after all.

interviewer: Is there anything specific you'd like to ask me before we begin?

patient: Nah, I’m good. Just… don’t let the static get too loud, you know? I’ve got a plant to water after this.

interviewer: Can you tell me what’s been on your mind most lately that led you to reach out for help now?

patient: Honestly? It’s like my battery’s been on low for months, but I kept telling myself I could just… power through. Work’s been a bandaid, keeping me distracted from the static. Even fixed this stupid HVAC in my apartment—felt better wrestling with pipes than facing whatever’s in my head. But最近… I guess the static got loud enough I couldn’t ignore it. Don’t know why now, though. I’m just… not charging.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone... Can you describe what you mean by the 'static' you mentioned?

patient: It’s like… that static you get on a radio when the signal’s bad. Not the loud kind that drowns everything out, just this constant low hum you can’t shake. Even when nothing’s playing. I guess it’s easier to ignore when I’m moving, you know? Like if I’m fixing a pipe or something—keeps my hands busy enough that I don’t hear it as much. But when I’m still? It’s just… there. Doesn’t make sense, I know. Probably just tired.

interviewer: That metaphor of static is quite vivid... When did you first notice this static starting, and has there been a specific time or event when it became more noticeable?

patient: The static... I think it started creeping in maybe six months ago. At first, it was just those sleepless nights, you know? Waking up at three, staring at the ceiling. But then... the divorce finalized, and it felt like someone turned up the volume. I kept telling myself it was just a rough stretch, that I could outwork it. Even fixed that stupid HVAC myself—probably overkill, but at least the pipes couldn’t nag me back. Still, some days it’s like carrying a backpack full of sand. Don’t know if it’s worth mentioning, really.

interviewer: It sounds like the static has really affected your daily functioning... Can you share an example of how this has impacted your work as an emergency tech?

patient: It’s like… I’m running on a bandaid. I catch myself hyper-focusing on tiny things—like tightening a bolt three times, just to keep my hands busy. Last week, I almost mixed up a med dose but caught it. Doesn’t help that I’m burning through bourbon like liquid Tylenol to quiet the static. Can’t afford to crack when someone’s life’s on the line, but… some days, the noise makes me wonder if I’m just waiting for the system to fail.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure of your job adds to the weight you're carrying... What would you most like to achieve through this therapy?

patient: I guess… I want to stop feeling like a faulty circuit breaker. You know, the kind that flickers when the load’s too heavy. I need to be reliable again—for the job, for… basic stuff. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not some broken thing needing fixed, but if therapy’s like a software update, I’ll take the patch. Just… no guarantees I’ll stop binge-watching Netflix instead of sleeping.

interviewer: It sounds like this has been a really challenging time for you. Have you experienced episodes like this in the past where you felt similarly overwhelmed or down?

patient: Honestly, work’s kept me on my toes before, but this... it’s like the static’s louder now. I’ve had rough patches, sure—long shifts, tight deadlines—but this feels heavier. Like the battery’s been drained longer than usual. I tell myself it’s just... maintenance. You know how it is. Things break down, you fix ’em. But sometimes the fixes don’t stick.

interviewer: It sounds like you're relying on routines to stay grounded. Who do you usually turn to when things feel overwhelming, or is there someone who's been a steady support recently?

patient: Honestly, doc, I just... I lean on the job, I guess. The team's good, but you know how it is—everyone's got their own fires to put out. I’ve got Mr. Peppy to water at the office. Keeps me from... you know, completely unraveling. Haha. I’m not great at leaning on people. Feels like I’d be a burden if I admitted I needed help.

interviewer: It sounds like Mr. Peppy is someone who helps you stay grounded—can you tell me a bit more about how they support you at work or otherwise?

patient: Mr. Peppy’s just a plant, but… keeping him alive feels like I’m still functioning. It’s the little things, you know? If I can remember to water him, maybe I won’t forget something bigger. Haha. Doesn’t talk back, so I don’t have to explain myself.

interviewer: It takes courage to find small anchors when everything feels heavy. Have you experienced similar periods in the past where you felt this level of distress, and if so, what helped during those times?

patient: Not exactly the same, but... I’ve pushed through worse, I guess. Back in the day, when the shifts got brutal, I’d just power through on coffee and... well, bourbon’s a good liquid Tylenol for the static. But this? The static’s louder now. Even the fixes feel like bailing water with a leaky bucket. Haha. I’m a walking hazard when I’m like this, doc. You should see me try to fix a broken thermostat—take three times as long, end up just staring at the manual like it’s a foreign language.

interviewer: It sounds like your usual coping strategies are no longer providing the same relief. Have you experienced any traumatic events in your life that you think might be contributing to your current feelings of being overwhelmed?

patient: Trauma? Not really my style, doc. I handle things as they come. The divorce... well, that’s just life’s way of keeping you on your toes. I’d rather fix a broken thermostat than dig into old wounds. Haha. You know how it is—some things you just... let go.

interviewer: It sounds like the bourbon has been a way to cope with the static—can you tell me how often you've been drinking and about how much?

patient: Most evenings, probably... two? Maybe three if the static's really loud. I tell myself it's just... liquid Tylenol for the noise in my head. Keeps me from being a walking hazard at work, anyway. Though honestly, I’m not sure where the line is anymore between ‘managing’ and ‘avoiding.’

interviewer: It sounds like the bourbon helps you cope with the static, but also leaves you feeling uncertain about your boundaries. Have you used any other substances, like cannabis or stimulants, to manage your symptoms or improve focus?

patient: No, just the bourbon. I’m not exactly the type to experiment—my job kind of locks me into a 'no surprises' policy. Coffee’s my stimulant of choice, even though it’s probably just keeping me in the static instead of silencing it. But at least with coffee, I don’t have to worry about crossing the line into 'liability' territory. Yet.

interviewer: Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including over-the-counter ones or vitamins?

patient: No prescriptions, doc. I don’t even remember the last time I bought vitamins—probably expired by now. Coffee’s my only ‘supplement’ these days. Keeps me from sinking too fast, I guess.

interviewer: Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or need very little sleep, even if it's not intentional?

patient: No, I’ve been the opposite—like my battery’s been on low all week. Coffee’s the only thing keeping me from crashing. Though sometimes I wonder if I’m just… faking awake. You know how it is when the machine’s grinding but nothing’s actually moving.

interviewer: It sounds like the low energy and static are really impacting your daily functioning. Have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts that feel real to you, even if they might not be?

patient: No, nothing like that. I’m just... hyper-aware of the edges, you know? Like, I catch myself second-guessing every decision, even the small ones. It’s probably just the static turning up the volume on my own head. Keeps me from being a walking hazard at work, anyway.

interviewer: It sounds like this 'static' is creating a lot of internal friction for you. Have you had any thoughts lately about ending your life, or making a plan to do so, even if it feels like a distant possibility?

patient: I’ve... I’ve thought about it, but it’s more like hoping the static just cuts out. I tell myself I can’t afford to crash—there’s too many people counting on me when the sirens go off. Sometimes the bourbon helps it quiet down, but... it’s not like I’ve written a script or anything. I’d rather fix a broken thermostat than think about that stuff.

interviewer: It sounds like the idea of the static stopping feels like a relief, even if you’re not planning how to make it happen. What’s keeping you from acting on those thoughts besides your responsibilities at work?

patient: It’s... there’s this plant I take care of at work, Mr. Peppy. Doesn’t do much but sit there, but I guess I don’t want to be the guy who can’t even keep a damn ivy alive. And the bourbon? It’s not a solution, just... noise-cancellation for a bit. I keep telling myself if I power through today, maybe tomorrow’s a little lighter. Sounds cliché, I know. But I’d hate to be the guy who crashes the whole system. Even if it’s just for the plant.

interviewer: It sounds like Mr. Peppy gives you a sense of purpose even in small ways. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol use recently, like drinking more or less than before?

patient: Honestly? It’s crept up a bit—more like evening maintenance now. Not a party or nothing, just… liquid Tylenol to mute the static. But I’ve cut back on takeout, so at least I’m not feeding the problem on two fronts. The plant’s still alive, so that’s a win.

interviewer: Do you currently have access to anything that could be used to harm yourself, like firearms, medications, or other means?

patient: Just the bourbon and a pill bottle I keep for... well, let’s just say it’s for quieting the static. But I’m not exactly in a position to, y’know, go full Rambo. Mr. Peppy still needs watering, after all.

interviewer: Let me recap: Over the past six months, you've described a persistent 'static' of low energy and distress, worsened by your divorce, leading to sleep disruption, bourbon use for self-medication, and concerns about work performance. You've relied on routines like caring for 'Mr. Peppy' to stay grounded, while avoiding emotional processing through technical metaphors. Your passive suicidal thoughts ('hoping the static cuts out') are tempered by job responsibilities. What did I miss?

patient: I think you caught the big stuff. Maybe you missed how the HVAC breakdown at my apartment’s been eating at me—feeling like I can’t even fix the basics anymore. But honestly, as long as Mr. Peppy’s still breathing and I don’t mess up a call at work, I guess I’m… functional. The bourbon’s just background noise, same as always.

interviewer: It sounds like you're doing what you can to manage the noise, even when it's overwhelming. Would you like to go over a few simple steps we could put in place to help keep things from feeling so heavy, especially if the static gets louder?

patient: Honestly? My go-to is still Mr. Peppy—water him, make sure he’s not wilting, and pretend that if I can keep one thing alive, maybe the rest won’t crumble. I know that sounds… small. But when the static gets loud, focusing on the plant or forcing myself to fix that damn HVAC instead of drowning in the noise? It’s like choosing to be a mechanic instead of the broken engine. The bourbon’s there too, but I tell myself it’s just… liquid Tylenol for the static. Don’t know if that counts as a step, though.

interviewer: It sounds like tending to Mr. Peppy and small fixes give you a sense of control when everything else feels overwhelming. Would you like to review what steps we can put in place this week to support that rhythm, and if there’s anything else you’d like to address before we wrap up?

patient: Yeah, I guess… maybe start with the HVAC. If I can get that fixed, it’s one less thing gnawing at me. And keep watering Mr. Peppy—saves me from staring at the ceiling at 3 a.m., you know? As for the rest… maybe cut back on the bourbon? Don’t want to turn into a walking hazard, after all. But let’s tackle one thing at a time. I’m a mechanic, not a magician.

interviewer: It sounds like focusing on the HVAC, Mr. Peppy, and gradually reducing bourbon use feels manageable as first steps. Would you like to confirm or adjust these priorities before we finalize our plan for the week?

patient: Yeah, let’s stick with that. The HVAC’s a wall I can chip at—one service call at a time. If I can get that fixed, it’s like… proof I’m not totally broken. The plant stays on the list, and the bourbon? I’ll try not to let it sneak into every evening. I’m not a magician, but I can start with the things that feel like fixes, not just bandages. Sounds good.

interviewer: It sounds like you're ready to move forward with your plan. Can you share how you'll manage if the static feels overwhelming or if thoughts of hoping it cuts out return?

patient: If the static starts to eat at me, I’ll force myself to focus on Mr. Peppy—or hit up a coworker for a distraction. Sometimes just hearing another voice helps, even if it’s about something dumb like a stuck HVAC. And if the bourbon’s knocking, I’ll tell myself it’s not ‘liquid Tylenol’ anymore… just a red flag. I’m not great at stopping it cold, but I can buy myself a few hours to breathe. Small wins, right?
