system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Ms. Sanchez, thank you for coming in today. My name is Sarah Rodriguez, and I’ll be working with you today. Would you be comfortable proceeding with our conversation now?

patient: Of course, Dr. Rodriguez. Thank you for seeing me. I’m… I’m used to being on the other side of these conversations, if you will. As a physician, I know how these things go. I suppose I’m just… cautious. My hands get a bit… shaky when I’m not holding a scalpel, but it’s nothing. Old bones, you know?

interviewer: That sounds like a big adjustment. Would you be comfortable continuing with our conversation today?

patient: Certainly, I’m willing to proceed. Just... let me make sure we use the time well. My hands get restless without a scalpel, but I’ll manage. Nothing a good routine can’t handle, right?

interviewer: It’s completely understandable to feel cautious in this role. Would you like me to explain how these sessions typically work and what we’ll focus on today?

patient: Sure, I appreciate structure. In medicine, we call this... informed consent. I suppose I just want to know the parameters. How much of this is... standard protocol? My hands are restless, but I’ll stay put. Let’s make the most of the clock, if that makes sense.

interviewer: I appreciate your clarity and directness. Would you be comfortable with us proceeding with this session today?

patient: Yes, let's proceed. I just... need to make sure we stay on track. My hands tend to fidget when I'm not in the OR, but it's nothing serious. Let's not waste time.

interviewer: Understood. To make this efficient for us both, would you like to ask any immediate questions before we begin?

patient: No immediate questions, Dr. Rodriguez. I do value efficiency—I suppose that’s why I’m here, after all. Though my hands seem to have other ideas...

interviewer: That sounds really concerning for you. When did you first start noticing this worry about your patients' care?

patient: It's hard to pinpoint, Dr. Rodriguez. I've always held high standards, but the error a few years ago... Well, the system is flawed. I suppose my hands started trembling during rounds then. It's just old bones now, I think.

interviewer: That sounds really concerning for you. How did that error affect your confidence in your work?

patient: It’s... complicated, Dr. Rodriguez. I’ve always double-checked my work, but after the error, I suppose I started second-guessing even routine decisions. The system is flawed, but I can control my own vigilance—though my hands still tremble when I sign charts. I compensate by staying late, cross-referencing every order. It’s just part of the job now, I think. Though... sleep has been harder. I lie awake worrying about what I might have missed the day before.

interviewer: It sounds like the sleep difficulties are compounding your anxiety. What would you most hope to achieve through this therapy?

patient: I hope to... function more efficiently, perhaps. To not let the... the background noise consume so much time. My daughter deserves a mother who’s not... constantly second-guessing every decision. Even if it’s just that. (Fingers tap once on her knee, then still.) And maybe sleep that doesn’t feel like I’m... replaying every missed decimal point in a blood test.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry, especially with your daughter watching. When did you first notice this level of worry and tension becoming part of your daily life?

patient: It’s hard to say exactly... I’ve always been meticulous, but after the error, the checking became... more compulsive. I suppose the tension has been building for years, though. Even now, I catch myself triple-checking medication orders, even routine ones. (Pauses, fingers brush knee tap.) My mother would’ve called it ‘being thorough.’ Sleep still feels like a... battlefield. I wake up parsing every decision from the day before, like a patient’s dose might’ve slipped through.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging, especially balancing so much responsibility while feeling physically and mentally overwhelmed. Have you experienced similar periods of worry or tension in the past, and if so, what helped during those times?

patient: I suppose... structuring my days tightly has always been a comfort. Pruning my roses, replaying medical podcasts on loop while cooking—things with clear steps, you know? It’s odd, but even my sleepless nights feel... efficient. I worry less when there’s a system. Though, honestly, I’m not sure if it helps or just postpones the worry. I keep telling myself it’s just old bones and overthinking.

interviewer: It seems your structured routines provide some relief, even if they feel uncertain. Have you experienced similar periods of worry or tension in the past, and if so, what strategies helped during those times?

patient: I suppose... the routines are just placeholders. They give the mind something to do while the rest of me... catches up, I guess. The HOA fight over the fence was a different kind of structure—rules, deadlines, someone else's expectations. That kept me busy, numbed the... other worries. But even then, my hands would shake when I tried to write the letters. Still do, sometimes. (Pauses, fingers flexing on lap.) To be honest, I don’t think anything ever truly helps. Just... quieter moments.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve been using structure as a way to manage overwhelming feelings, even if it’s not a permanent solution. Have you experienced similar periods of intense worry or physical tension in the past, and if so, what did you try to cope with it?

patient: The fence permit mess was... a distraction, I guess. Filling out forms, arguing with the HOA—it gave my mind something rigid to focus on, like a puzzle. But even then, my hands would tremble when I signed my name. (Pauses, flexes fingers.) Honestly, most things feel trivial compared to the... background noise. You don’t get rid of it, just learn to parse it while you chop vegetables or memorize drug dosages. Though lately, even that feels like a performance.

interviewer: It sounds like those structured activities provided some relief, even if temporarily. Have you experienced similar periods of intense worry or physical tension in the past, and if so, what strategies helped during those times?

patient: I suppose keeping busy with my parents' affairs... but it's just practical stuff, really. Their health is... complicated. (Glances at watch, fingers tensing.) Honestly, it's the same thing: breaking tasks into steps. But my shoulders ache worse now, like they're carrying the weight of it all. (Soft, bitter laugh.) You know how it is—pretending control matters when your hands still shake over a coffee cup.

interviewer: That physical weight you're describing sounds like it's compounding everything. Who helps you manage those tasks, or who do you turn to for support when the weight feels too heavy?

patient: I suppose... I just handle most things myself. It's practical, you know? My daughter is... busy with her own life. We don't see eye to eye on much these days. (Flexes hands, glances at watch.) The HOA mess kept me occupied for a while—rules to follow, someone else's structure to navigate. But my shoulders... they ache worse now. (Soft chuckle.) You learn to carry the weight, even when it feels like your bones are made of sand.

interviewer: It seems like carrying the weight alone has become a habit, even when it’s hard. Have you ever sought professional help for anxiety or stress in the past, and if so, what did that involve?

patient: Not really, I suppose. I've always managed with routines—pruning the roses, cooking lentil stews, you know. Keeps the mind occupied. The body... well, these old bones creak a bit, but it's nothing a heating pad can't handle. I suppose you could say I'm my own case manager.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been navigating a lot alone. Have you experienced any significant traumatic events or adversities in the past that might be adding to this pressure?

patient: Traumatic? I suppose not in the way you mean. There was... a mistake at work years ago. It haunts me, but I tell myself systems are flawed. My parents’ health? That’s just life’s curveballs. And the HOA—good grief, who knew a fence could consume so much mental real estate? I keep going because routines do that, don’t they? They’re... placeholders. Though half the time, I’m just waiting for the next thing to unravel. My hands don’t like this conversation, by the way—they’ve been twitching since you mentioned ‘pressure.’

interviewer: I want to ask about any changes in your alcohol, cannabis, or other substance use recently. Have you noticed any shifts in your use patterns or amounts over the past few months?

patient: I suppose a glass of wine with dinner helps the medicine go down, if you will. It’s not...excessive, just a little ritual. The HOA hearings are so exhausting, you know? But I wouldn’t call it a change. My parents’ health does keep me up, though. More than the wine, I think.

interviewer: It sounds like the wine is part of your routine to cope with stress. Have you been using any other substances, like cannabis, stimulants, or prescription medications, to help with anxiety or sleep?

patient: To be honest, no—just the wine. Though sometimes I pop a melatonin if the HOA emails keep me up. My shoulders... they’ve been tighter than a surgeon’s grip lately. I suppose you could say I’m a one-trick pony when it comes to coping. (Glances at watch, fingers tapping the armrest once.) But isn’t it remarkable how pruning rosebushes can feel like... like threading a suture? Distracts the mind, anyway.

interviewer: It sounds like the physical tension and sleeplessness are really weighing on you. Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life?

patient: Harming myself? I suppose I’ve had... dry thoughts. Like, *I wouldn’t miss the noise*, if you will. But then I think of a patient who rallied after I nearly gave up on them. Keeps me... anchored. (Glances at watch, fingers still on the armrest.) Time’s a good reminder to stay busy, don’t you think?

interviewer: It seems your connection to your patients gives you a sense of purpose. Have you ever had any thoughts of harming yourself in the past, even if not recently?

patient: I suppose... there are moments when the noise feels unbearable. But I’m not sure that’s what people mean when they ask. I once stayed up for 36 hours recalculating a patient’s dosage after a system error—maybe that’s the closest. (Picks at coffee cup, fingers trembling slightly) Dr. Rodriguez, do you check the clock a lot here? It’s just... keeping time feels like the only way to stay anchored.

interviewer: It’s interesting how timekeeping feels grounding for you. Have you noticed any periods lately where you feel unusually energetic or need less sleep, even while feeling stressed?

patient: Not really energy, but I do find myself... restless. My mind races even when I try to rest. (Fingers tap the armrest) I suppose I've been sleeping less, but it's more like my body won't wind down. The clock seems to tick louder these days.

interviewer: It sounds like the restlessness is really disrupting your sleep and focus. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually restless or like you need to be constantly moving, even when you're not trying to be?

patient: I suppose... my hands don't know how to be still when I'm in my head. (Fingers tap the armrest again) It's not so much moving as... rerouting the energy. Like trying to prune a rosebush with a scalpel. Dr. , do you mind if I... (glances at wrist, pauses) ...just adjust my sleeve? The shoulder seams are pulling something loose.

interviewer: I notice you're adjusting your sleeve—have you been experiencing any new or worsening physical discomfort in your shoulders lately that might be related to stress or anxiety?

patient: To be honest, it's not new—my shoulders have always ached with this... dull tension. (Adjusts sleeve again, fingers hesitating) Lately, they feel tighter, like after a long day in the garden pruning roses. I suppose it's just old bones, Dr. Rodriguez. (Glances at wrist, then quickly away) The HOA meeting last week didn't help, of course. Paperwork gives me the same ache in my neck.

interviewer: I notice you’ve mentioned melatonin for sleep—could you share if you’re currently taking any other medications, supplements, or vitamins, including those for anxiety, pain, or other health concerns?

patient: I take a basic multivitamin most days and the melatonin... maybe three nights a week. (Fingers brush the armrest) Dr. said the magnesium might help with the muscle aches, but I’m not sure. The rest is just... old bones, I suppose. (Glances at wrist) The HOA correspondence doesn’t help, of course. Paperwork gives me the same ache in my neck.

interviewer: It sounds like physical discomfort is a significant part of your stress. Have you noticed any other physical symptoms or medical concerns that might be contributing to your stress or anxiety?

patient: My hands still tremble when I'm not holding a scalpel, and my shoulders feel like rusty hinges by evening. I suppose the HOA drama doesn't help—keeps me up parsing every word in emails. Just old bones, though. Dr. Rodriguez, I know you're used to patients with something more... dramatic.

interviewer: It sounds like your physical symptoms are deeply intertwined with your stress. Have you been evaluated for conditions like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain that might contribute to these physical sensations?

patient: They ran a thyroid panel last year—everything was 'textbook,' as Dr. Patel put it. I suppose I could mention the sleep study I declined… too inconvenient, honestly. The HOA emails are probably the real culprit. You won’t find me at happy hour, but at least my bones creak for a reason, right?

interviewer: I want to make sure we cover all important aspects. Have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts recently?

patient: Hallucinations? Goodness, no. Though I will say the HOA correspondence does make me question if I'm misreading every 'landscape compliance update' as a personal vendetta. (Pauses, checks watch.) But that's just... old habits. My daughter teases me about being the neighborhood conspiracy theorist. I suppose if I hear voices, they're just my patients' heart rates in my sleep.

interviewer: It’s interesting how the HOA correspondence feels like a metaphor for your stress. Have you noticed any other thoughts where you feel someone is targeting you or watching your actions, beyond what might be typical for your role as a doctor or in your neighborhood?

patient: Honestly? I catch myself second-guessing every email I send to colleagues now. Like, did I misstate a lab value? Is someone waiting for me to slip up? (Checks watch.) But it’s just... my usual background noise. The same way I parse HOA letters, I guess.

interviewer: Let me recap: You’ve shared persistent anxiety about work performance and health since a past medical error, physical symptoms like tremors and tension, sleep issues, and stress from caregiving and HOA disputes. These concerns have worsened over time, impacting your focus and family dynamics. What did I miss or misframe here?

patient: I suppose you might have missed that the sleepless nights aren't just the HOA—my parents' health is... a tangled thread. But that's just old habits. (Checks watch.) And sometimes, I think... maybe my body knows to shut down the noise. (Forced laugh.) Like that patient who recovered, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like your parents’ health is adding another layer to your already heavy responsibilities, and you’re noticing your body’s reactions in ways that feel both familiar and concerning. What did I miss or misframe in summarizing how these factors fit together?

patient: You captured the parents part... I suppose. It’s just old habits, worrying about their care. The HOA fence thing is another... trivial worry that keeps me up. My hands still tremble sometimes, but it’s just old bones, right? The garden helps, though—I’ve been pruning relentlessly. Forced laughter, maybe? (pauses, rubs palms together once) Dr. Rodriguez, do we have time for the blood pressure numbers I took last week? Just a quick review.

interviewer: Let me recap: We’ve discussed how persistent anxiety about work performance, caregiving, and health has led to sleep issues, physical tension, and worries about your medical practice. A past error seems to have deepened these fears, while routines like gardening and structure help you cope. How does that align with your experience, and is there anything I’ve missed or oversimplified here?

patient: You’re... close, Dr. Rodriguez. The garden, the HOA nonsense—it all knots together, I suppose. My hands still tremble when I prune, but I tell myself it’s just old bones. (checks wristwatch, pauses) The parents’ care... it’s another decimal point in the spreadsheet of things I can’t control. You didn’t mention the coffee. Three pots a day. Keeps the shaking at bay... most days.

interviewer: I appreciate you highlighting the role of coffee in managing the shaking—it’s an important detail I should’ve included. How does that fit into how we’ve been discussing your stress and physical symptoms so far?

patient: Coffee is... the closest I have to a counterbalance. The shaking in my hands lessens, just enough to prune the roses without snapping a stem. But it’s a fragile fix—by afternoon, the fatigue settles in like sand in my veins. (glances at watch, fingers tapping the armrest once) I tell myself it’s efficiency, not dependence. The garden needs tending, after all. (pauses, rubs knuckles) You didn’t mention the migraines I get when I skip a cup. Just another decimal point in the spreadsheet, I suppose.

interviewer: Let me clarify: You’ve mentioned that your coffee routine helps manage hand tremors but also causes migraines when skipped. How does this pattern fit into our earlier discussion of stress and physical symptoms?

patient: It’s... a balancing act. The coffee sharpens the tremors into something manageable, but when I miss a cup, the migraines feel like a system error I can’t debug. (Rubs temples briefly) My shoulders ache worse then, like the muscles are keeping a spreadsheet of all the things I can’t fix. (Glances at watch) I tell myself it’s efficiency—fueling the machine to stay functional. But the garden? That’s the only ritual that doesn’t feel like a decimal point I’m constantly recalculating.

interviewer: Let me summarize what we've covered so far: Your persistent anxiety about work performance, health, and caregiving responsibilities has led to physical symptoms like tremors, migraines, and chronic muscle tension. You rely on structured routines—like your coffee ritual and gardening—to manage these symptoms, though they feel increasingly performative. Stressors like the HOA disputes and your parents' health add to the sense of being overwhelmed. What did I miss or misframe here?

patient: You’re... accurate, Dr. Rodriguez. The garden, the coffee—both are just ways to parse the noise. My daughter’s expectations add another layer, I suppose. She’d rather call me ‘resilient’ than ‘exhausted,’ but it’s all decimal points in the same equation. (Checks watch, hesitates) I force laughter sometimes... to mask the rest. The HOA, the parents—it’s all tending to the same overgrown patch. You didn’t mention the watch-checking. Habit, I guess. Keeps the minutes from... unraveling.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing so openly today, Angela. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify about what we've covered?

patient: I think we’ve covered the essentials, Dr. Rodriguez. The HOA correspondence has been... frustrating, but it’s just paperwork, really. I suppose I’ll mention the garden—pruning helps, though my hands still shake without a scalpel. Time slips, you know? I check my watch, but it’s nothing serious. Just old bones and decimal points, I suppose.
