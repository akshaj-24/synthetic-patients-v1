system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Hello Jessica, my name is Monica Hall. We’ll be discussing what’s been going on for you so I can better understand how to support you. May I proceed?

patient: Sure, I guess. Just keep in mind I’m pretty straightforward—no dramatics. To be honest, I’ve been feeling... I don’t know, like my head’s stuck on loop? Same worries just replaying. Work’s been fine, but the rest? Not great. My shoulders are always tight, and sleep’s a joke. I’ll say this though—my orchid’s thriving. Maybe that’s the only thing growing right now.

interviewer: It's interesting that your orchid is thriving amidst everything. Are you comfortable continuing with our discussion today?

patient: If you think it’s necessary... I guess we can keep going. My shoulders are still tight, and sleep’s still a joke, but I’ll power through. Just don’t ask me to ‘reflect’ too much—my brain’s already overloading. I’d rather fix the problem than dissect it.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty, Jessica. Do you have any specific questions about how this session will work before we move forward?

patient: Honestly? I’m not sure what to expect. I just... hope we don’t get stuck in circles. Last time I tried therapy, it felt like going over the same grind for hours. My shoulders are already knotting up thinking about it. If we’re doing this, I’d rather tackle the stuff that’s actually messing with my days—like why I can’t sleep or why I snapped at Mark last week. Not... abstract stuff. Keep it simple, I guess.

interviewer: It makes sense that you'd want to focus on what's most pressing for you. Would you be comfortable moving forward with that focus today?

patient: I guess... if we’re doing this, let’s keep it pointed. I don’t want to waste time if we’re just going to circle the same stuff. My shoulders are already twitching thinking about it. Let’s talk about the sleep, or why I snapped at Mark. Or maybe... how I can stop feeling like a broken IV pump that won’t shut off. But if we start with the orchid, I’m out.

interviewer: It sounds like the constant worry is really affecting your daily life. Can you tell me more about what these worries are focused on?

patient: I guess... it’s everything piling up. Like, what if I miss a symptom at work and someone gets hurt? What if the bills keep growing faster than my paycheck? And then there’s... home stuff. My shoulders are always like this tight knot. I try to tell myself it’s just stress, you know? But the thoughts don’t turn off. They just loop. Last night I stayed up until 2 am recalculating our budget in my head. My husband says I’m overthinking, but how am I supposed to relax when the ‘what ifs’ feel so real?

interviewer: It sounds like the physical tension and racing thoughts are really wearing on you... When you mentioned 'home stuff,' what specific challenges or worries have been coming up there?

patient: Home... it’s like the ticking clock that won’t stop, you know? My husband’s been between jobs, and every unpaid bill feels like another knot in my shoulders. I catch myself double-checking the locks at 2 a.m. even after we argued about money. Last week I snapped at him for suggesting we ‘breathe through it’—like I’m not already gasping. The orchid’s blooming, but it’s just... another thing I have to force myself to water. I guess I’m worried I’ll suffocate everyone with my... noise.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy weight that's hard to share. When did these feelings of being overwhelmed by worry and tension first start for you?

patient: I guess you could say it’s been building since the early days of my marriage. Trying to balance shifts, student loans, and... I don’t know, just the weight of everything piling up. My husband’s been between jobs, and I started feeling like I was treading water, you know? But it’s not just that—my mind’s always racing, even when there’s no real reason. Like, last week I stayed up replaying a conversation I had three days ago. It’s exhausting. My shoulders hurt just thinking about it.

interviewer: It sounds like these worries have been a growing part of your life for some time. What are your hopes for how we can work together to address this?

patient: I guess... I want to actually fix the things that are breaking down, not just dissect them. Like, if we could figure out how to quiet the noise in my head long enough to sleep through the night? Or stop my shoulders from being permanent concrete. My husband says I’m ‘over it,’ but how do I prove to myself that I’m not just... crumbling slowly?

interviewer: Have you experienced episodes like this before, and if so, what found to be helpful?

patient: I guess... yeah, I’ve been here before. Like when student loans first started piling up and I’d lie awake redoing the math until my head throbbed. What helped? Forcing myself to make lists. Like, writing down every single bill and just... ticking them off. Even if it was just ‘paid this week’ or ‘called about this.’ It’s stupid, but it made the noise feel... contained? My husband tries to help, but he doesn’t get that I need the chaos to have rules. Even now, I’ll stay up bucketing water from the basement in my head instead of sleeping. It’s just... easier than letting the ‘what-ifs’ win, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like the financial strain and relationship dynamics are adding to your sense of chaos. Have you experienced any past events or challenges that might be contributing to the stress you're feeling now?

patient: To be honest, I think I mentioned this before, but... my parents always handled stuff on their own during tough times. If there was money trouble or stress, they never asked for help. I guess I just learned to do the same. But now, with the loans and the marriage... it’s like my brain’s on a drip IV of ‘what-ifs.’ I can’t stop the flow. My shoulders are killing me from holding it all in. I’m not saying it’s easy, but... maybe I just hate feeling like I’m failing at being enough for everyone.

interviewer: It sounds like you carry a heavy weight of responsibility, and it's clear how much you value being there for others. How does your husband typically respond when he notices you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed?

patient: He says things like 'just breathe' or offers to take over, but it feels... dismissive. Like he can’t see how deep this goes. I guess I snap at him then, and afterward, I hate that I do. My shoulders just lock up tighter, and I end up retreating. It’s not that he’s wrong—it’s just... not enough.

interviewer: It sounds like your parents’ approach to handling stress has left a lasting impression. Can you share how you think their way of managing challenges might be influencing how you cope with your own stress now?

patient: I guess... it’s like they taught me to stitch up problems myself, even when the thread’s fraying. If they didn’t ask for help, how could I? Now, when the loans or the marriage feel like they’re unraveling, my first move is to tighten my grip—shoulders up, breathe shallow, keep going. But it’s not working. Last week, I snapped at my husband over the groceries, then spent hours bucketing basement water while he slept. The orchid’s blooming, but it feels like I’m just... patching leaks in a dam. You know?

interviewer: Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: No... not really. I mean, sometimes I catch myself thinking, 'What if I just... faded away?' But it’s not like that. It’s more like being stuck in a fog, you know? My shoulders are so tight I can’t sleep, but I’d never... do anything. The orchid’s still alive, at least. Even if I forget to water it half the time.

interviewer: Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use recently?

patient: I haven’t touched alcohol since college, really. My dad had these rare... explosive moments when he’d drink, so I just never saw it as an option. It’s not that I crave it or anything. Cannabis? Never my scene. I’d rather stay sharp, you know? Even when my shoulders are killing me, I need to feel in control. Though lately, I’ve been so tired I’m half-convinced caffeine’s seeped into my bones.

interviewer: It sounds like caffeine has become a big part of your routine. How much caffeine do you typically consume in a day, and have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or sleep since increasing your intake?

patient: I guess... it’s somewhere between 4 and 5 cups of coffee, plus a couple of energy drinks during double shifts. It keeps me from collapsing, but my hands still shake when I try to chart patient notes. Sleep? I’ll say this—since the basement flooded, I’ve been bucketing water in my dreams. My husband says ‘breathe,’ but how do you explain to someone that even when you’re not sleeping, your body’s already spent?

interviewer: It sounds like caffeine is playing a big role in managing your energy, even with the physical toll. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, and if so, how have you been adhering to them? Have you noticed any side effects?

patient: No meds, really. I’ve avoided them—my dad’s history with anxiety makes me leery. The caffeine’s my ‘remedy,’ even though it just keeps me wired. My hands shake worse when I need to focus... but at least it’s something I control, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like caffeine is playing a big role in managing your energy, even with the physical toll. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic, need less sleep, or take more risks than usual?

patient: No. The energy’s more like... a forced wakefulness. Like my body’s on a caffeine drip, but it’s not real energy. I just push through because I have to. My hands still shake, but at least I’m not collapsing mid-shift. That’s the goal, right?

interviewer: It sounds like caffeine is helping you stay alert but causing physical strain. Have you noticed any experiences where you hear voices, see things others don’t, or have thoughts that others are trying to harm you?

patient: No. I don’t... I’ve never heard voices or anything like that. It’s more like my head’s always buzzing with the same old worries. Like a broken radio stuck on static. I guess it’s just the usual noise.

interviewer: I hear how your mind feels like it's stuck on a loop of static. Have you ever been diagnosed with or experienced any medical issues like thyroid problems, sleep apnea, or chronic pain that might be contributing to your symptoms?

patient: No. The docs ran tests last year—thyroid was fine. They said I was ‘stressed.’ My shoulders? They feel like concrete blocks. Maybe I should start wearing a neck brace to work. For humor, right? It’s the only thing that keeps me from snapping again.

interviewer: Jessica, from what you’ve shared, it sounds like your anxiety has been a long-standing challenge, especially around work, finances, and your marriage, with recent stressors like your husband’s unemployment and unpaid bills making things worse. You’ve been using caffeine to manage fatigue but it’s causing physical strain, and while you’re trying to handle things on your own, it’s taking a toll on your relationships and sleep. What did I miss?

patient: I guess you didn’t miss the part where my hands tremble so bad I almost spilled a whole tray of lab samples last week. But hey, at least the orchid’s blooming—proof I can still force life out of chaos, right? Not that it matters if I’m just... falling apart under the surface.

interviewer: Jessica, you’ve described how your anxiety manifests physically—like the tremors that nearly caused an accident at work—and how you use small acts of care, like tending your orchid, to hold onto a sense of control. If I were to summarize, your worries loop around work safety, financial stress, and strained communication with your husband, all while your body bears the weight of chronic tension and sleeplessness. What did I miss?

patient: You didn’t mention how my body feels like a coiled spring—tighter every day. The caffeine’s not cutting it anymore, and I snapped at my husband last night over something stupid. But the orchid’s blooming… guess that’s the only thing growing right now.

interviewer: Jessica, you’ve shared how your body feels increasingly tense like a coiled spring, the caffeine is no longer managing your fatigue, and recent marital conflicts—like snapping at your husband—highlight how this stress is spilling into your relationships. At the same time, the orchid’s bloom feels like a small but meaningful act of resilience. What did I miss?

patient: You didn’t ask why I keep tending that orchid like it’s some kind of... penance. Like if I nurture it enough, maybe my own life will root itself. But the soil’s always damp, you know? I’m just... afraid if I stop bucketing water, the whole house’ll collapse. And my husband says ‘breathe’ like it’s a switch I can flip. It’s not. It’s more like trying to hold my lungs underwater.

interviewer: Jessica, you’ve shared how tending the orchid feels like penance—a way to force stability when everything else feels unsteady—and how your husband’s advice to ‘breathe’ feels dismissive, like it ignores the physical and emotional weight you’re carrying. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... you didn’t ask how my hands still shake when I try to water the orchid, like I’m afraid I’ll crush it. The blooming’s just proof I can fake normalcy, you know? My husband says ‘breathe’ like it’s a fix, but my lungs feel like they’re already full of water. I’m just... terrified if I stop bucketing—literally or metaphorically—the whole house’ll drown. And I’ll be the one who let it happen.

interviewer: It sounds like the fear of losing control and the pressure to maintain things is really overwhelming for you. Is there anything else I haven’t captured about how this is affecting your life?

patient: I guess... I don’t want to sound like I’m complaining, but sometimes I feel like if I slow down too much, I’ll just... fall apart. Like everyone’s expecting me to handle it all, and if I admit I can’t, I’m a failure. My husband means well, but when he says ‘breathe,’ it’s like he’s saying I should just magic this away. I can’t even explain how it feels—like my lungs are made of concrete.

interviewer: Jessica, you’ve described the immense pressure you feel to maintain control while fearing that any slowdown will lead to collapse, along with the frustration when support feels dismissive. It sounds like the physical and emotional weight of this is really taking a toll. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... the thing you might’ve missed is how I can’t relax even when I’m not busy. My hands shake if I pause too long, like the caffeine’s holding me together. But it’s just... more of the same cracks, I guess. You know how it goes.
