system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Sarah. Would you be comfortable with me beginning by explaining how this session will go and checking if you're okay with proceeding?

patient: Sure, I guess. Whatever needs to be done. I just... I have to finish that patient file by tomorrow, so maybe we could wrap up by then? No, that sounds dramatic. I’ll just sit here and listen.

interviewer: It sounds like you're ready to get started. Would you be comfortable with me explaining how this session will work and confirming you're okay to proceed?

patient: Yeah, sure. I mean, I’m here, so... let’s get started. Just try to keep it efficient, if that’s okay? My shift starts early tomorrow, and I need to... I don’t know, mentally prepare? It feels like a grey day that just won’t lift, you know? But I’ll manage.

interviewer: Would you like to proceed with the session as we've discussed?

patient: Yeah, let’s proceed. I just need to… make sure I don’t lose track of time. It’s one of those days where the hours seem to vanish, you know? But I’ll manage.

interviewer: I appreciate how committed you are to managing your time while being here. How does focusing on understanding your current concerns and exploring support options sound to you?

patient: It sounds... practical, I guess. As long as we can keep it structured? I’ve been handling most things on my own, but maybe there are efficiencies I’m missing. It’s just that everything feels like a grey day with no end in sight. But I’ll work with what we have.

interviewer: Can you tell me about what's been bringing you to seek help right now?

patient: I guess it’s been this... grey day feeling that just won’t lift. I’m always behind on things—work tasks, even small stuff like laundry. I used to love crafting, but now it feels like another thing I’m supposed to do. I catch myself staying up late replaying conversations, wondering if I messed up. It’s not just tiredness. It’s like... time’s slipping, but I can’t catch it.

interviewer: It sounds like the disrupted sleep is adding to the weight you're carrying. When did this pattern of waking at 3 AM first start for you?

patient: It started maybe three months ago. I keep telling myself it’s just work stress—patient charts, checklists, all that. But even on days off, I lie there thinking about... nothing, really. Just can’t shake the feeling that I’m one mistake away from everyone noticing how messy I am.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure you're under is really taking a toll on your confidence. What would you most like to achieve through this process?

patient: I guess... I just want to feel like I can keep up without everything piling up. You know, stop waking up at 3 AM going over checklists in my head. If I could, uh... enjoy a hobby without it feeling like another task, that’d be something.

interviewer: It sounds like the sleep disruptions and loss of enjoyment are really affecting your daily life. When you mention waking up at 3 AM, have other symptoms like difficulty concentrating or changes in appetite started around the same time, or was there a specific event that made things feel like they crossed a threshold?

patient: I guess... the concentration stuff? Yeah, I’ve been foggy, like my brain’s stuck in slow motion. I rely on these checklists now—like, I carry them in my pocket so I don’t miss anything at work. As for appetite... I snack more, maybe? But it’s not like I can’t function. There’s no one moment that tipped it over. It’s just... the grey day getting a little darker, I guess. Doesn’t that sound dramatic?

interviewer: It sounds like the checklists are helping you stay on track at work. Have you found any other strategies that help manage the foggy thinking or stress, or is it mostly the checklists you rely on right now?

patient: I guess the checklists are the main thing, honestly. They... they help me feel like I’m not forgetting something important. I, uh, sometimes have a glass of wine to, you know, quiet the thoughts? It’s not really helping, but it’s something. (pauses, avoids eye contact) My partner says I should take breaks, but I worry about falling further behind. It’s just... it’s just the way it is, I think.

interviewer: It sounds like the wine is an attempt to manage the mental pressure, even if it’s not effective. When did you first start using alcohol as a way to cope with these thoughts, and has the amount or frequency changed over time?

patient: I guess it started... maybe around the same time the sleep issues got bad? Like three, four months ago? It’s just a glass most nights, but it helps me shut off the... the racing, you know? Feels like a grey day that won’t lift. I mean, it’s not like I’m blackout drunk or anything, but...

interviewer: It sounds like the alcohol provides temporary relief but isn’t resolving the underlying distress. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or ability to function the morning after you have the wine?

patient: Honestly? My head feels like a fog bank most mornings. I power through with coffee and checklists, but... the tiredness lingers. I guess it’s part of the same grey day thing, just... thicker. I don’t want to complain, though. It’s manageable.

interviewer: That sounds really exhausting. Can you share a specific example of how the foggy thinking affected your work recently, like the medication documentation mistake you mentioned earlier?

patient: There was this one time I mixed up the dosage notes for a patient. I double-checked the checklist, but my head was so foggy... I guess I just missed the decimal point. It wasn’t a big deal—they caught it before administering—but I’ve been overthinking it ever since. Feels like that grey day just... thickens. I keep telling myself I’m just careless now.

interviewer: That sounds like a moment that really deepened the self-criticism you've been carrying. When did the foggy thinking and checklists become part of your routine—was it before or after the sleep disturbances started?

patient: The fog... I guess it started creeping in after the sleep stuff. Like, once I was waking up at 3 a.m. every night, I just couldn’t trust my head during the day. The checklists? They came later, maybe a couple months ago. I needed something solid to hold onto, you know? Even if the fog was still thick. Feels like that grey day just... weighs everything down. I don’t know. It’s not like they’re helping, but if I didn’t have them, I’d probably fall behind. Again.

interviewer: It sounds like this situation is really impacting your work and relationships—have you experienced episodes like this before, where you felt persistently low mood and struggled with daily tasks?

patient: I guess... not really? I mean, I’ve had busy periods or stress before, but this feels different. Like the grey day just... won’t pass, you know? It’s not just tiredness—it’s this fog that makes even checklists feel pointless sometimes. I keep waiting for it to lift, but three, four months in... it’s just there. Every. Single. Day.

interviewer: It sounds like this persistent fog is really affecting your daily life. How has your partner been trying to support you during this time?

patient: They’re... trying to get me to take breaks, I guess? Like, asking if I want to go for walks or just sit somewhere quiet. But I end up making checklists instead of talking about how I feel. It’s not that they’re not helpful—there’s just so much to do, you know? Sometimes they’ll mention the fog, but I just focus on the tasks. It’s easier that way.

interviewer: It sounds like focusing on tasks helps you cope, even if it's hard to talk about feelings. Have there been any significant challenges or difficult experiences in your life that you think might be related to how you're feeling now?

patient: This might sound dramatic, but... I guess it’s the little things. Like that mistake at work with the patient records—it felt like proof I’m just careless. My mom used to say I was ‘undisciplined’ when I was younger, and I still hear that in my head. The crafting stuff I used to love? It’s been years since I even opened my yarn drawer. But I don’t know... does that even matter? My landlord just raised the rent, and I’ve been so tired I can’t think straight half the time. It’s like the grey day just... won’t end.

interviewer: It sounds like your mom's words still carry weight for you—how do those feelings of being 'undisciplined' connect to how you're viewing yourself now, especially with the work mistake and fatigue?

patient: I guess it’s like... the grey day just gets heavier when I mess up, you know? That mistake at work felt like my mom was right all along—like I’m just not cut out for things. But I keep making checklists to ‘fix’ it, even though they just make me more tired. My landlord’s been bugging me about rent too, and I can’t even think straight half the time. It’s not that I don’t try... it’s like the fog’s too thick to see past the next task.

interviewer: It sounds like the financial strain from your landlord is adding to the weight of the fog you described. How has this stress been affecting your ability to manage daily tasks or stick to your checklists?

patient: It’s like... the checklists get longer, but I end up staring at them for hours. The rent thing makes me hyper-focused on details—like double-checking numbers I don’t even care about. But then I can’t sleep, so the fog’s worse. I guess the wine helps me ‘relax’ after, but it just... blurs everything more. My partner says I’m overcompensating, but I don’t know how else to keep things from falling apart. The grey day just... drags on.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone. Have you experienced similar patterns of checklists, self-criticism, or fog in past challenging times, even if not as prolonged as this?

patient: I guess... when I was in school, I’d make these study schedules that were way too tight. If I messed up one day, I’d rewrite the whole thing. It’s not the same as now, though. Back then, the fog would lift after a weekend. This time... the grey day just sticks around. Last year I could at least fake-energy my way through crafting, but now even that feels like another task. I keep thinking if I just check one more thing off, maybe the fog will... I don’t know. (Trails off, fingers fidgeting with the edge of her seat cushion.) The rent’s due again next week, and I’m already second-guessing the numbers in my head.

interviewer: It sounds like those past patterns of perfectionism and self-criticism feel different now in how persistent and heavy they are. Have you experienced other periods in your life where this 'grey day' feeling lasted for months instead of lifting after a short time?

patient: School was... I guess there were semesters where I felt that same stuckness. But it always lifted eventually. Now, it’s like the grey day just... won’t end. The checklists help, but they’re not enough anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like the persistence of this fog feels uniquely overwhelming compared to past challenges. Have the patterns in these past episodes—like the study schedule perfectionism—ever been linked to specific stressors or life events at the time?

patient: I guess... school stress was part of it. Finals week, maybe? But this time, it’s not just stress. It’s more like everything stacks up—like the documentation error at work, my mom’s comments... they just keep adding layers to the fog. I can’t even tell what started it. The checklists help me focus, but...

interviewer: It sounds like past patterns of perfectionism and self-criticism feel connected to your current struggles. Can you tell me about any other times when you noticed similar patterns of perfectionism or self-criticism, and what helped you back then?

patient: In school, I’d get stuck on study schedules... like if I missed a day, I’d obsess over catching up. But it always passed eventually. Crafting used to do that too—knitting, anything with clear steps. Now, even those things feel... flat. The checklists help me focus, I guess, but the fog just weighs heavier. It’s not the same as before. I can’t even tell what’s causing it anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like the shift from structured tasks providing comfort to feeling like a burden marks a significant change. What strategies or supports helped you manage those perfectionism patterns in the past, especially with school or crafting?

patient: In school, I guess I just... forced myself into strict schedules. Like, if I missed a day, I’d spend hours catching up. Crafting was similar—knitting, you know? It had clear steps, so I felt in control. But now... even checklists feel like another task I’m failing at. I try to tell myself it’s just burnout, but the fog just... lingers. This might sound dramatic, but it’s like the routines used to be anchors, and now they’re just weights. I can’t even finish a project without second-guessing everything. Ugh, sorry, I’m rambling. Did you say something about rent increases earlier? My landlord’s being a nightmare again.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy shift from anchors to weights. Have the strategies that helped you manage perfectionism in the past, like strict schedules or structured tasks, been something you've tried adapting recently to cope with the current fog?

patient: I guess I still try with the checklists, but they just... sit there on my phone like a to-do list from a different life. The wine helps a little, but it’s not the same as before. I can’t even finish a knitting project without hating the color choice. Did I mention my landlord’s dragging out that rent increase? It’s like the grey day has a landlord too, collecting rent on my hope.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly difficult to carry alone... Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life in the past week or so?

patient: I guess... it’s not that I want to harm myself, but some days the grey just feels endless. Like, you wake up and it’s all fog and weight. But I don’t know—this might sound dramatic. The landlord’s been giving me a hard time about the rent, and I’ve been trying to keep up with the checklists to... to stay on top of things. It’s just a lot, I guess.

interviewer: I hear how heavy that feels... How often have you been having thoughts that it might be better not to wake up in the mornings?

patient: Some days, when the rent and the checklists pile up... it feels like the grey just digs in. But I keep going, I guess. It’s not constant, but when the fog’s thick, waking up feels like... extra work. Wine helps the edges blur, but the thoughts don’t really go away.

interviewer: Have you been using any other substances, like cannabis, stimulants, or opioids, in addition to alcohol?

patient: No, just the wine, really. I guess... it’s mostly to help me unwind after the checklists and everything. Sometimes I wonder if it’s just... making it harder to think clearly, but it’s the only thing that quiets the noise for a bit. The landlord’s been on my case about the rent again, so... you know, some days it feels like the grey day just won’t lift, and the wine’s the only anchor.

interviewer: It sounds like the wine helps you cope with the weight of everything, even if it doesn’t fully ease the pressure... Have you noticed any changes in how much or how often you’re drinking lately, or have you considered using anything else besides wine to manage the stress?

patient: I guess... the wine’s been more frequent, especially with the landlord stuff. It’s just... another item on the checklist, I suppose. Helps me... you know, not think about the numbers for a bit. But no, nothing else—just the wine. It’s cheaper than therapy, right?

interviewer: It sounds like the wine has become a significant part of your routine for managing stress... Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, prescribed or over-the-counter, that you'd like to mention?

patient: No, I’m not on anything else—just the wine. It’s... the only thing that helps me unwind after the checklists. Feels like a grey day that just won’t lift, but at least it quiets the noise for a bit.

interviewer: It sounds like the wine is a key part of your routine... Have you experienced any periods in the last few months where you felt unusually energetic, needed significantly less sleep, or acted on impulses you wouldn't normally take?

patient: No, I guess not. I’ve just been... stuck in the same routine, you know? The checklists help me keep things on track. The wine is more about... winding down, not really doing anything impulsive. It’s just part of the routine now, I guess.

interviewer: I hear how the routine feels like both a lifeline and a weight... Have you noticed any strange thoughts, perceptions, or beliefs lately that feel out of character for you, even if just a little?

patient: I guess... sometimes I catch myself thinking that I’m just a burden to everyone, but then I remind myself that’s not logical. I mean, I pay my bills, I show up for work... it’s just this fog, you know? The other day I almost forgot to water my plants and felt awful, like even basic stuff is slipping. But that’s probably just stress. The checklists help, though—I couldn’t function without them.

interviewer: From what you've shared, it sounds like the past few months have brought a heavy sense of low mood, trouble sleeping, and difficulty finding joy in things you once loved, all while managing work and personal pressures. You've mentioned feeling overwhelmed by self-criticism, using routines to stay grounded, and noticing how stress and financial worries seem to make things harder. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?

patient: I think you hit most of it... the fog, the checklists, the way everything feels heavier. Maybe you didn’t catch how the nights are the worst. I’ll lie there at 3 a.m., going over every stupid thing I said or did, imagining everyone’s just waiting to give up on me. The wine... it’s not really about relaxing. It’s more like turning down the volume on the noise in my head. But I guess that’s still part of the same... grey day thing.

interviewer: You mentioned that the nights are especially hard with ruminations and that the wine helps quiet the noise in your head. What else might be part of this pattern that I haven’t caught yet?

patient: I guess... sometimes I oversleep on weekends? Like, I’ll just... collapse and wake up at noon? It’s not really rest, though. Feels like the grey day’s just holding me down longer. I guess it’s another thing to hide from my partner.

interviewer: It sounds like the weekend oversleeping adds another layer to how the 'grey day' affects your rhythm and relationships. To recap: We've discussed low mood, disrupted sleep (early waking and weekend oversleeping), fatigue, reduced interest in activities, concentration difficulties at work, self-criticism, and using alcohol to manage distress. How does this align with your experience, or what might I have missed?

patient: I guess... the landlord’s been hassling me about the rent lately. I’ve been... managing, but it’s just another thing piling on. I don’t know, maybe that’s not even relevant compared to the fog and the checklists... It’s just... heavier now, you know? The grey day feels like it’s weighing on everything, even stuff I should be able to handle. I guess that’s it.

interviewer: It sounds like the financial stress with your landlord is adding weight to the 'grey day' you've described. Before we finalize this summary, is there anything else I've missed that's important to your experience right now?

patient: It’s all part of the same grey day, I guess. The rent thing… it’s just another weight. I’ve been relying on wine more, but it’s not helping. I don’t know, it’s all the same fog. The checklists feel heavier now, like they’re not even checklists anymore—just… anchors. I can’t seem to lift them.

interviewer: To recap: Your experience over the past few months has included a persistent 'grey day' fog with low mood, sleep disturbances (waking at 3 a.m. and weekend oversleeping), fatigue, concentration difficulties at work, increased alcohol use to quiet distress, and checklists that now feel like anchors. Financial stress with your landlord and self-criticism about perceived inefficiency seem to be adding weight to this pattern. How does this align with your understanding of what’s been going on, and is there anything I’ve missed that’s important?

patient: Yeah, that’s… that’s pretty much it. The checklists used to help, but now they just feel like this weight I can’t shake. And the wine—well, it’s cheaper than therapy, I guess. My partner says I’m hiding behind routines, but I don’t know how else to… to hold things together. It’s all the same grey day, just… heavier.

interviewer: It sounds like the 'grey day' is both a backdrop and a weight, with routines and alcohol acting as temporary supports but feeling less effective now. How does this formulation align with your understanding, and what might we prioritize first in addressing this pattern?

patient: Yeah, that’s… that’s pretty much it. The checklists used to help, but now they just feel like this weight I can’t shake. And the wine—well, it’s cheaper than therapy, I guess. My partner says I’m hiding behind routines, but I don’t know how else to… to hold things together. It’s all the same grey day, just… heavier.

interviewer: It sounds like the 'grey day' is both a backdrop and a weight, with routines and alcohol acting as temporary supports but feeling less effective now. How does this formulation align with your understanding, and what might we prioritize first in addressing this pattern?

patient: It’s… it’s accurate, I guess. The checklists used to help, but now they’re just this weight. And the wine—well, it’s there, but it’s not fixing anything. I think… I think the 3 a.m. wakeups are the worst. I keep replaying stuff, you know? Proof I’m failing at… everything. My partner says I’m overcompensating, but how else do I…? (shoulders slump slightly) I don’t even have energy to explain it right.

interviewer: It sounds like the 3 a.m. rumination is a significant part of the struggle. What would you like to focus on first in addressing this pattern?

patient: I guess… the 3 a.m. thing. It’s like my brain won’t hit ‘pause’ on the checklist audits. I keep thinking if I could just fix that, maybe the fog would lift a little. But the wine helps me fall back asleep, so… (shrugs, voice trailing) It’s not like I can just stop doing that either.

interviewer: It sounds like the 3 a.m. rumination and the checklist anchors are central to how you’re experiencing this 'grey day.' If we were to start building a plan together, what kind of support or changes would feel most helpful to you right now—like talking through patterns, exploring new coping strategies, or something else?

patient: I guess... structure? Like, not just the checklists, but maybe learning to adjust them? They’re supposed to help, but lately they feel like... I don’t know, another thing to stress about. And maybe understanding why the 3 a.m. wakeups happen? I keep thinking if I could just fix that, the rest might... lighten? But I’m not even sure that’s realistic. My partner says I need to rest more, but when I try, I just end up oversleeping and feeling worse. It’s a loop.

interviewer: So what I’m hearing is that the checklists, which once helped you stay grounded, now feel like a heavy burden, and the 3 a.m. wakeups with rumination feel like a cycle you can’t break—even the attempts to rest differently just add to the frustration. Is there anything else about how this pattern feels or what might matter to include before we think about next steps?

patient: I guess... the wine. It’s not helping, but it’s the only thing that... quietens the noise for a bit. And the landlord’s been sending those late fees notices—feels like another proof I’m just... slipping. But maybe that’s just the grey day again. I’m not sure where to start fixing any of it.

interviewer: It sounds like the 'grey day' is central to how you're experiencing this period, with the wine and financial stress adding to the weight you're carrying. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is showing up for you?

patient: I think you got the main stuff... maybe the part about the weekends? When I oversleep, it’s not rest, just... another way I’m messing up. And the landlord’s notices—feeling like they’re proof I’m failing. But maybe you’re right, it’s all just the grey day. I guess sometimes I catch myself... liking small things, like how my partner’s shampoo smells, but I brush it off. Doesn’t matter.

interviewer: It sounds like the 'grey day' continues to shape how you experience challenges like sleep, financial stress, and small moments of connection. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is showing up for you right now?

patient: I think you got the main stuff... maybe the part where the checklists make me feel even more tired, like I’m working against myself. And the wine—saying it’s ‘cheaper than therapy’ sounds flippant, but it’s not funny. It’s just... another way the grey day wins. I guess sometimes I notice things, like the shampoo smell, but I tell myself it’s pointless. Like, what’s the point if it’s just another gray day? But maybe that’s just the grey day talking.

interviewer: It sounds like the grey day continues to shape your experience, including moments of connection that feel dismissed. What would you like to prioritize first in addressing this pattern?

patient: I guess... starting with the checklists? Like, if they’re supposed to help but just add to the weight, maybe there’s a way to... simplify them? And the 3 a.m. thing—figuring out if there’s even a way to stop the brain from spiraling there. The wine feels like a dead end, though. It’s not like I can just stop, but maybe... maybe that comes later? I don’t want to sound dramatic, but it’s like the checklists are the only thing holding the grey day at arm’s length, even if they’re making me more tired. I’ll worry about the rest if I can even get through one night without replaying every mistake first.

interviewer: It sounds like the checklists, 3 a.m. rumination, and financial stress are central to how you’re navigating this grey day, even as the wine feels like a temporary but unhelpful anchor. What did I miss or get wrong about how these elements are shaping your experience right now?

patient: I think you got the checklists and the 3 a.m. spirals right... but maybe what’s missing is how the landlord stuff feels like another proof I’m just bad at... managing basics. And the wine? It’s not that it’s unhelpful—I guess it’s just the only thing that makes the noise at night feel... muffled, even if it’s not quiet. It’s like the grey day has weights now, and I’m just dragging them longer. Oh, and my partner says I’m hiding behind the lists, but I don’t know how else to... hold things together.

interviewer: It’s clear you’ve been carrying a lot on your shoulders lately. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to address or clarify about what we’ve discussed?

patient: I think that’s about it... maybe just that my partner keeps saying I’m hiding behind the lists, but I don’t know what else to do. And there’s this... thing about their shampoo sometimes, the way it smells when they’re near. It’s stupid, but it feels like the only small thing that doesn’t weigh anything. But I guess that’s just me trying to find something ‘normal’ when everything else feels broken.
