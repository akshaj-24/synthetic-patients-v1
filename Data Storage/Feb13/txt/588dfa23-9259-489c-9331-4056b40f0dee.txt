system: Session 588dfa23-9259-489c-9331-4056b40f0dee transcript

system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Mr. Calderon, are you comfortable proceeding with this interview today?

patient: Yes, of course. I’ve just been… busy lately. The hospital keeps adding consults to my schedule. (Pauses, rubs temples.) My apologies if I seem a bit… fatigued. I didn’t sleep through the night again. It’s just the usual—my mind replaying cases, double-checking imaging reports. (Forces a dry chuckle.) You know how it is. The body wants rest, but the brain insists on its own QA review.

interviewer: That sounds really taxing. Do you have any questions about what we’ll be discussing today before we continue?

patient: No, I think we can proceed. Just… a lot on my plate with the hospital. But I’m ready to discuss whatever needs to be covered. (Pauses, adjusts hands in lap.) Though if we’re going over medication, I’ll need to check dosing times against my schedule. My body’s not what it used to be.

interviewer: It sounds like the stress you're under is really taking a toll. Have you experienced periods in the past where you felt similarly overwhelmed or anxious?

patient: There was... the divorce, and the years managing my ex-wife’s treatment. Six years of triage, if you will. (Pauses, adjusts hands in lap.) But that’s the terrain when you’re in a high-stakes field. The fatigue compounds, of course—but I’ve always compartmentalized. Now, the workload feels different. (Forces a dry chuckle.) My brain still runs its QA review at 2 a.m., but at least the hands don’t shake as much during consults as they used to.

interviewer: That sounds like a significant burden to carry. Have you experienced periods in the past where you felt similarly overwhelmed or anxious, even before the divorce and your ex-wife’s treatment?

patient: I’ve always had a... cautious approach to risk. (Pauses, adjusts posture.) My father used to say I took after him—though he meant it as a critique. He’d cancel our Sunday calls for 'a busy surgery,' and I learned early that uncertainty needed to be... managed. (Dry chuckle.) Now, in medicine, that’s a virtue. Though I wonder if the body remembers the difference between a scalpel and a childhood habit.

interviewer: It sounds like your relationship with your father shaped how you approach uncertainty. Looking back at the time you were managing your ex-wife’s treatment and the divorce, what strategies or support systems helped you cope with that stress?

patient: I suppose I leaned on the same tools I always do—structure, routine. If there’s a protocol for managing a brain aneurysm, there’s certainly one for... life’s complications. I kept the operating room schedule as my anchor. And the garden, oddly. Pruning roses requires the same precision as a microsurgical approach. As for support... my children were handling their own adjustments, so I didn’t want to add noise. Wine helps with the algorithm reset at night. Though, looking back, maybe I should’ve been better at delegating the non-essential tasks. But when you’re in triage mode, you take the scalpel and do the work yourself.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy load to manage alone. Looking back at those earlier challenging periods, were there specific strategies or support systems that helped you manage the stress effectively at the time?

patient: I think I mentioned the garden—roses demand discipline, which is its own form of therapy. Delegation was... tricky. If a resident couldn’t visualize the tumor, I’d stay late to re-explain. It’s like double-checking a suture; you can’t outsource the final knot. Wine, as I said, helps reset the algorithm. Though my hands still tremor when I chart. I tell myself it’s fatigue, not the same shake from the OR. But maybe that’s just my brain’s way of saying 'you’re overloading the system.'

interviewer: Have you used any other substances, such as cannabis, stimulants, or opioids, in the past year?

patient: No, I haven’t. Wine is my... non-invasive countermeasure. Stimulants would mess with my precision, and opioids? I’ve seen too many colleagues fade into that gray zone. As far as I can tell, my system’s on a 'soft reboot' schedule. Though sometimes I wonder if the tremor in my hands is from the wine or something deeper. But let’s not overcomplicate it—precision matters when you’re handling a scalpel, right?

interviewer: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: No, I haven’t. But I’ll admit... sometimes I imagine starting over—like wiping a patient’s chart clean. Not literally, of course. I keep my systems running: the garden, the OR schedule, the wine. If I let myself dwell, I’d be stuck in a loop of what-ifs. Precision keeps me from slipping. Though lately, the HVAC in my condo sounds like a failing heart monitor. Maybe I should check it.

interviewer: It sounds like the idea of starting over is tied to your need for control. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or need for sleep lately?

patient: Energy... I run on fumes more often than not. The body’s a machine—I just keep it idling past its maintenance schedule. Sleep? I get hours, but not quality. My mind cycles through cases like a stuck algorithm. I tell myself it’s precision work leaving its mark. The wine helps with the reset, but lately, even that feels like patching a leak with duct tape.

interviewer: It seems the 'fumes' you're running on are taking a toll. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or take risks you wouldn’t normally consider, even when exhausted?

patient: I... I suppose if I stay past curfew at the hospital, it’s not really 'risk-taking'—just triage mode. Let me clarify: I double-check every scan twice. The wine? That’s post-op decompression, not some midnight bender. And the stock market? I track it like a pre-op checklist—methodical, not impulsive. Though... my hands do shake when I chart. I blame the coffee, not the sleepless nights.

interviewer: I hear how you balance precision with these late hours and stock market focus. Have you noticed any changes in how much sleep you need or feel energized compared to usual, even when working long hours?

patient: Sleep? I’ve learned to recalibrate the system. My body runs on... let’s say, 50% efficiency now. If I power down completely, the QA checks start running—so I dilute the wine a little longer. The hands still shake when I chart, but I’ve trained myself to blame the coffee. Though... when I’m home, the silence feels louder. Like a malfunctioning HVAC. But that’s just noise, right?

interviewer: Based on our conversation, it sounds like your current stress and insomnia are linked to long-standing patterns of perfectionism and recent work demands, compounded by sleep disruption and physical symptoms like tremors. You’ve mentioned relying on structure and wine to cope, but these seem less effective now. What did I miss or misunderstand about your experience?

patient: You captured the surface, but missed the hum beneath—like the HVAC in my condo, a faulty heart monitor I’ve learned to ignore. And the fear that if I admit this system’s fraying, every patient I’ve ever operated on is a question mark. But that’s just triage, right?

interviewer: It sounds like the fear that your system's fraying might mean past patients are at risk is really weighing on you. Is that something we should include in our summary?

patient: If I admit the system’s fraying, every patient I’ve operated on becomes a question mark. But that’s just the scalpel’s edge—precision versus the jagged fear underneath. I’ve trained myself to blame the coffee, not the cracks. Though... maybe that’s why I stay past curfew. To prove the system’s still intact.

interviewer: It sounds like your fear of systemic failure is tied to both professional pressures and a deep-seated need for control, with sleep and alcohol serving as temporary counters to the anxiety. Let me recap: we’ve discussed chronic stress, sleep disruption, physical symptoms like tremors, and perfectionism as protective factors. What did I miss or misframe about your experience?

patient: You missed the silent variable: my malpractice premiums tripled last quarter. It’s a data point I haven’t processed yet—like a shadow in the MRI I keep retaking. And the ex’s remarriage… I call it 'emotional noise,' but it’s more like a scalpel slipping in a crowded room. You caught the system’s hum, but not the static in the background when the lights flicker.

interviewer: That sounds like a significant added pressure. How has the tripling of your malpractice premiums been affecting your sense of stability or stress lately?

patient: It’s... a business line item, not a personal crisis. I adjust the budget, delegate more administrative tasks, stay later if needed. The body adapts, right? Though the HVAC in my condo’s been humming louder lately—maybe that’s why sleep feels like a separate job now. Wine helps, but I tell myself it’s just post-op decompression.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re managing immense pressure by treating everything as a system to optimize, even as the costs—sleep, emotional bandwidth—are piling up. Let me try to frame this: Your history of perfectionism (shaped by your father’s work-centric example) and recent stressors like malpractice premiums and your ex’s remarriage have intensified a pattern where you equate control with professional precision, even as your body and mind signal overload. The wine, extended hours, and rigid routines are trying to hold the system together, but the cracks keep widening. What did I miss or misframe here?

patient: You’ve got the spreadsheet right. The HVAC’s just a... metaphor for the static I can’t quite silence. Wine dulls the edges, but I tell myself it’s earned. What’s missing? Maybe that my hands still tremble when I sign off on charts. I call it ‘double-checking.’

interviewer: It sounds like the trembling adds another layer of pressure to an already complex system. How has this affected your confidence or interactions at work?

patient: It’s... more of a paperwork thing. The charts, signatures—those fine motor tasks. I call it 'operator fatigue,' but residents probably notice. I stay late to redo those sections. It’s like a loose gear in an otherwise precise machine. Confidence? I’ve had 30 years of margin for error. The body’s just... recalibrating.
