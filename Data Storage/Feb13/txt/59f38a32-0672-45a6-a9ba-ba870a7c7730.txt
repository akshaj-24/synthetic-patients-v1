system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for coming in, Katherine. Would you prefer to be called by another name or use different pronouns?

patient: Katherine is fine. Always been Katherine. I’m not one for fancy stuff, you know? Just keep it straightforward. No need for any of that other stuff. I guess... is there something specific you need from me today?

interviewer: Thanks for sharing that, Katherine. I appreciate your directness. Today, we’ll take things step by step—would you be comfortable starting with me explaining how these sessions typically work?

patient: Um, sure. I guess. Just don’t take too long—I’ve got a list of things to do. My dog’s been acting up lately, if that helps.

interviewer: I appreciate your eagerness to get started—would you be comfortable proceeding with the session today?

patient: Yeah, I guess. Just don’t want to waste too much time. My dog’s been acting up, so... I’ve got to figure that out. But I’m here now, so let’s get to it.

interviewer: It sounds like you're ready to move forward. Do you have any questions about how we’ll proceed before we start?

patient: No, I guess not. My dog’s been on my mind... I’m the queen of mess-ups, so I doubt I’ll be asking much here. Let’s just get to it.

interviewer: Can you tell me about the main concerns that have brought you here today?

patient: It’s... it’s mostly about my dog, Max. He’s been really sick, and I feel terrible I can’t take care of him properly. I guess I’ve been so focused on him that I haven’t been sleeping well, and work’s been piling up. But you know, it’s probably just me being the queen of mess-ups again.

interviewer: It sounds like Max’s illness has added a lot of pressure on you lately. When did you first notice his health starting to decline, and how has that affected your work schedule or responsibilities?

patient: Well... it’s... hard to say exactly when... maybe a few months ago? I guess I didn’t notice at first... you know how it is. But then... I started staying later at work to make up for the time I was spending on him... but honestly, I’m just... I’m just not getting enough rest. And my boss... I don’t want to let him down, but I can tell I’m slipping up more.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load right now. How have your sleep patterns changed since Max's illness started?

patient: I’ve been... I’ve been lying awake a lot, you know? My mind’s like a stuck engine—it just won’t turn off. I keep checking on Max, making sure he’s comfortable, but then I end up staring at the ceiling for hours. If I do sleep, I wake up around 3 a.m. and can’t go back. I tell myself it’s just ‘stress,’ but... it’s starting to eat into my days. I’m so tired, but my brain’s still running the same loops: What if I’m not doing enough for him? What if I mess up at work and they fire me?

interviewer: It sounds like caring for Max has added a lot of weight to what you’re already managing. Have you experienced periods in the past where you felt overwhelmed by similar stressors, or where your mood and energy levels were affected in a similar way?

patient: I guess... there was that time after the divorce when I couldn’t sleep for weeks. But I told myself it was just... stress, you know? My brain’s like an old machine—too much pressure and it just sputters. This time feels worse, though. Harder to ‘reset.’ Maybe I’m just... breaking down for real this time.

interviewer: It sounds like this current experience feels more overwhelming than past challenges. When you had trouble sleeping after the divorce, were there any strategies or supports that helped you cope back then, even if they felt temporary?

patient: Honestly? I just... kept working. Like, way past reasonable hours. If I was busy fixing things at work, I didn’t have to think about... everything else. My sister offered to help, but I said no. I guess I figured if I just powered through, I’d prove I wasn’t ‘broken.’ But... it’s the same now with Max. I’m just... not good at asking for help. Or admitting I need it.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of responsibility alone right now. Who else, besides your sister, have you found yourself relying on during stressful times?

patient: Honestly? Not many. I mean, my sister keeps offering, but I don’t want to be a burden. At work, sometimes the guys will let me vent, but it’s not like they can fix it. I guess I just... tighten the bolts myself, you know? Even if it takes longer. What I’m trying to say is, it’s not a big deal. I’ve always handled stuff on my own.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been managing stress by working through it, even when it's hard. Have there been other times in your life when your mood or energy was affected by stress, and if so, what helped you through those periods?

patient: I guess... before this whole Max thing, there was that job error. I just kept working until it 'fixed itself,' but that’s not even fixing. It’s more like... burying the problem. Now with Max, I can’t even do that. I stay late at work to 'compensate,' but it’s the same old song. What helps? Honestly? I don’t know. Maybe I just... don’t know how to do anything else. It’s not like anyone’s asking, anyway.

interviewer: It sounds like your usual way of coping isn’t working as well now. What do you think is different about this situation with Max that makes it harder to cope in the same way?

patient: This time... it’s not just a loose bolt. It’s... it’s like the whole frame’s rusted out. I can’t just tighten it. And if I mess up again, Max... he’s not something I can undo. (Fidgets with hands, voice cracks slightly) I stay late at work to ‘compensate,’ but all I’m really doing is... avoiding. I’m the queen of mess-ups, I guess. What’s different? Maybe I’m finally running out of things to fix.

interviewer: It sounds like Max’s situation is challenging your usual way of coping. Can you share what specifically about caring for Max feels different from past stressors?

patient: It’s... it’s not just the fixing part. Before, it was like a broken pipe—you could replace the section, turn the water back on. But with Max, it’s like... he’s the pipe. If he goes, there’s no replacement. I keep thinking I should’ve noticed the symptoms sooner, but I just... kept tightening the same bolts. Now he’s getting weaker, and I’m too tired to even stay awake for his vet visits. It’s not a big deal, really. Old age catches up to you, I guess. What’s the point in fixing something that’s already... breaking? (Voice wavers, pauses to clear throat.) I just hate that it’s not something I can fix without messing it up more.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly frustrating and overwhelming. Can you think of any moments where you felt a sense of connection or comfort with Max, even in the midst of this difficult time?

patient: There was this one afternoon... before he got sick... we used to walk by the park. He’d bolt after squirrels, and I’d laugh even though I should’ve been tired. It felt like... a flicker of peace, you know? But now, even that’s gone. I can’t even stay awake for his vet visits. What’s the point? (Voice cracks, pauses to clear throat.) I just... I hate that I can’t even hold onto that anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure right now. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life in the past few weeks?

patient: I... I don’t know. Sometimes I just feel like I’m a battery that’s dead, you know? But it’s not like I’d ever... I mean, who would take care of Max then? He’s the only one who still... relies on me. I guess I just think about disappearing sometimes, but it’s more like... I don’t want to be here when everything’s falling apart. Not really suicide, just... being somewhere else. But I can’t even say that right.

interviewer: It sounds like your sense of responsibility for Max is a big part of what keeps you grounded. Have you used alcohol or other substances in the past few months to cope with stress or sleep difficulties?

patient: I... I guess I have a glass of wine now and then. Not really to cope, just... to unwind, I guess? It’s not like it’s fixing anything, though. (Sighs, fidgets with her hands.) Sleep? Yeah, I toss for hours. My mind’s just... sputtering, you know? But I can’t complain when Max needs me. (Forces a wobbly smile.) At least he doesn’t care if I look like a mess in the morning.

interviewer: Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, either prescription or over-the-counter, including things like sleep aids or vitamins?

patient: No, I don’t take any medications. Just a multivitamin sometimes, maybe... (sighs) I don’t know if that counts. Can’t really afford to slow down with Max needing me, you know? (Forces a wobbly smile.) It’s not like I’d ever... stop moving, even if I wanted to.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re pushing yourself hard to keep going despite feeling overwhelmed. Have you noticed your energy levels lately—do you still feel as motivated or driven as you used to, even with how tired you are?

patient: Motivated? I guess that’s the word... It’s like my engine’s just... sputtering. I get by, but everything takes twice as long. (Pauses, rubs her temples.) You know how it is—when you’re trying to tighten a bolt but your hands won’t stop shaking. (Softly, avoiding eye contact.) Max needs me to be here, so I... I force myself to keep turning the wrench. But the battery’s definitely not holding a charge anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like pushing through is taking a lot out of you. Have you experienced any periods where you feel like you don't need much sleep or have more energy than usual, even when you're tired?

patient: No, ma’am. It’s the opposite, really. I feel like my battery’s been... sputtering nonstop. Even when I try to push through, it’s like forcing a wrench on a rusty bolt—everything just grinds. (Pauses, fingers tapping the armrest.) The only time I feel... functional is when I’m scrambling to meet deadlines or vet appointments for Max. But that’s not energy, that’s just panic keeping the engine running. I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like your energy levels are really tied to the stress of caring for Max. Have you ever been diagnosed with a medical condition like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain that might be affecting your energy or sleep?

patient: No, nothing like that... I guess I just haven’t had a good night’s sleep in weeks. The vet says Max’s kidney issues are getting worse, and I’m up half the night worrying about him. My boss already gave me a warning about being late, so I’m trying to stay on top of things, but... it’s like my battery’s just dead. What good’s a diagnosis if you can’t fix it with enough coffee and willpower anyway?

interviewer: I hear how drained you feel from trying to hold everything together. Have you noticed any times when your thoughts feel especially racing or when you can’t stop talking, even if it’s exhausting?

patient: Not really... my head feels more like a sputtering engine that won’t switch gears. I’ll just keep replaying the same thoughts—like, what if I miss another vet appointment and Max gets worse? Or what if I fall asleep at work again? It’s not like I *want* to think about it, but... there’s no off switch. I guess the wine helps quiet it sometimes, but then I just feel like a mess the next day.

interviewer: I hear how the cycle of worry and self-criticism is wearing on you. Have you used any other substances, like cannabis, stimulants, or opioids, in the past few months to cope with stress or sleep difficulties?

patient: No, just the wine... I guess that’s about it. It’s not like I have time to experiment with anything else. Max needs his meds, and I’ve got that list of repairs to finish before my boss checks in again. What good’s a break if you’re already behind on everything?

interviewer: I hear how being behind on everything adds to the weight you’re carrying. Have you noticed any times when you feel unusually energetic, restless, or like you don’t need as much sleep, even if you’re tired?

patient: No, I’m just... I guess you could say I’m too restless to even think about rest. It’s like my brain’s on a loop, but not in a ‘can’t sit still’ way. Just... stuck. Even when I’m exhausted, I can’t slow down enough to sleep. But that’s just stress, right? With Max and work...

interviewer: Let me recap what I’ve heard so far: Over the past few months, your dog Max’s worsening kidney disease has disrupted your sleep—especially those 3 a.m. awakenings—and left you exhausted, impacting your work performance. This stress, combined with self-critical thoughts like calling yourself the ‘queen of mess-ups,’ has deepened feelings of hopelessness and passive thoughts of ‘disappearing’ when overwhelmed. You’ve also mentioned avoiding vet visits and relying on wine to unwind, though it doesn’t help. Is there anything I missed or misrepresented here?

patient: Yeah, that's... that's pretty much it. I just keep thinking if I can fix Max's schedule, maybe everything else will catch up. The wine? It's not really working, but what's the point in complaining? I'm the queen of mess-ups, right? But I guess... I guess you already heard all this.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy load right now—between Max’s care, work demands, and the toll on your energy. What did I miss or what feels most important to focus on as we wrap up today?

patient: I guess... the vet visits are a mess. I can’t even stay awake during them, but I don’t want to leave Max alone. It’s like trying to fix a pipe with no parts left—what’s the point? And work... I’m just slowing everyone down now. Might as well be the queen of mess-ups again.

interviewer: It sounds like the strain of balancing Max’s care with work is taking a toll, and the self-criticism feels almost like a weight you’re carrying. Let me try to summarize: Over the past few months, Max’s worsening kidney disease has disrupted your sleep and energy, leading to work mistakes and feelings of being overwhelmed. The guilt about caregiving and fear of letting others down seem to fuel thoughts like ‘queen of mess-ups,’ while avoiding vet visits adds to the frustration. Is there anything I missed or needs adjusting before we discuss next steps?

patient: Yeah, that’s... that’s pretty much it. I guess the wine at night isn’t helping either. I tell myself it’s just to unwind, but it just leaves me slumped worse. And those walks with Max before he got sick—watching the squirrels used to feel like the only ‘normal’ thing left. Now even that’s just another thing I’m failing at. The battery’s just... rusted, I guess.

interviewer: I hear how losing those walks with Max and feeling like the wine adds to your exhaustion must compound the weight you're carrying. Let's look ahead—would you like to explore options like therapy, adjustments at work, or other supports to help with Max's care and your energy? What feels most doable right now?

patient: I guess... therapy sounds like another thing I’d mess up, honestly. But maybe talking to someone who doesn’t look at me like I’m ‘fine enough’? I don’t know. As for work… if I asked for a later shift, would that even matter? I still can’t stay awake for vet visits, and Max’s just… the pipe’s leaking faster now. The wine’s the only ‘unwinding’ I can afford, but it just makes the battery drain quicker. I’ll think about the rest… if my head stops sputtering long enough.

interviewer: It sounds like the idea of therapy feels both necessary and intimidating, especially with the weight of Max’s care and work demands. Let’s check in—what would help you feel more ready to explore options like therapy, work adjustments, or other supports right now?

patient: I guess... if someone could just hold the wrench steady while I try to tighten the bolts without shaking? Like, a therapist who doesn’t act like they’re fixing me, just... listening? And maybe if my boss wouldn’t look at me like I’m some broken machine they can’t repair? But what do I know—maybe I’m just the queen of mess-ups asking for a manual that doesn’t exist.

interviewer: It sounds like the idea of therapy carries a mix of hope and fear for you, especially with the added pressure of work and caregiving. What did I miss or need to adjust before we agree on next steps like exploring therapy or discussing work accommodations?

patient: I guess... the guilt of being a burden to everyone? Like, if I ask for help, does that make me even more of a mess? And the wine... it’s not really unwinding, it’s just... buying time before the battery dies. But what do I know? Maybe I’m just the queen of mess-ups who can’t even admit she’s broke.
