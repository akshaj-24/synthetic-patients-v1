system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Rodney. It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. Have you had any thoughts about how you might bring that sense of wanting it to stop to an end?

patient: I guess... it’s like trying to turn off a radio that’s stuck on static. You know it’s there, but you can’t find the switch. Sometimes I think about just... letting the days blur together until it all feels normal again. But then I remember the truck. If I can just fix that, maybe I’ll feel like I’m doing something right. Even if it’s just pretending.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging, Rodney. Would you be okay with us continuing this conversation today?

patient: I guess... if you think it’s worth the time. I don’t wanna waste yours. The truck’s a mess, but at least it’s something tangible. You know? Static’s one thing... but a broken engine? I can tinker with that. (pauses, avoids eye contact) Doesn’t mean I won’t still freeze up halfway through a sentence, though.

interviewer: It takes courage to share these thoughts. Would you be comfortable proceeding with our conversation today?

patient: I guess... if the truck’s worth fixing. The static don’t care if I’m here or not, but maybe tinkering keeps it at bay a little. (Shifts in seat, fingers tapping knee) I’ll sit a while longer as long as we’re not just talking circles. You know how engines are—sometimes you gotta keep turning the key till the damn thing catches.

interviewer: I appreciate your willingness to share this metaphor—it gives me a sense of your resilience. What is it about fixing the truck that feels meaningful to you right now?

patient: I guess... it’s the parts you can see, y’know? Like, the engine’s a mess, but I can take it apart piece by piece. If I clean a carburetor or tighten a bolt, it’s proof I’m not just... stuck in the static. (Looks away, fingers tapping his thigh) The truck don’t care if I mess up. It just needs the next step. Even if the next step’s tiny. (Softly) My mom used to say fixing things taught you how to live. I guess I’m... trying to remember that.

interviewer: It sounds like fixing the truck helps you feel grounded in small, manageable ways. Is there anything about how this conversation works that you’d like to ask before we go further?

patient: I guess... I just want to make sure we don’t get stuck in the static. The truck’s a... a start, you know? As long as we’re talkin’ about things that don’t make me feel like I’m back there again.

interviewer: It makes sense to focus on what feels forward-moving for you. Would you like me to explain how this session will work before we move forward?

patient: I guess... it’s up to you. Just don’t let us get tangled in the static again. The truck’s a solid starting point—mess with that engine, you can see what’s broken and maybe, just maybe, fix it. (Pauses, avoids eye contact) I’m not good with... abstract stuff. Keep it simple, I’ll follow.

interviewer: I appreciate your clarity, Rodney. Does that mean you’d like me to explain the structure of our session briefly before we begin?

patient: Yeah... if it’s like the truck, you know? Step by step. Just... don’t make it some fancy thing. I’ll lose track otherwise. (Trails off, fidgets with hands)

interviewer: I appreciate your preference for simplicity. Would you like me to outline the session’s structure briefly now—just a few key steps, like working on the truck—before we begin?

patient: Yeah... if it’s like the engine. Check the spark plugs first, then figure out what’s next. (Fidgets with hands) As long as we don’t... you know, overcomplicate it. (Avoids eye contact) I can follow if it’s step by step.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying a lot of weight lately. Can you tell me a bit more about when this started for you—was there a specific time or event that feels like the beginning of this struggle?

patient: I guess... it started creeping in after the eviction. Missed a few bills, got kicked out, and it felt like the floor just kept falling away. Then that old fishing rod my dad gave me—lost it in a move, probably. (Fidgets) And... I don’t know, the longer days just felt heavier. Like the weight on my chest... it didn’t go away. (Trails off, avoids eye contact) I guess you could say the static started then. It just... never turned off.

interviewer: That sounds really overwhelming... What would you most like to see change or improve through this process?

patient: I guess... if this could help me get that truck running again, maybe. It’s like... if I could just focus without all the static, maybe I could stop feeling like I’m stuck in reverse. (Fidgets with hands) But I don’t know. The weight’s still there, you know? Even when I’m working on it, it’s like... it’s like the bolts keep tightening themselves back loose.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight you're carrying now feels both familiar and overwhelming. Have you experienced episodes like this before, where you felt overwhelmed or stuck in the past?

patient: I guess... there was a time after my mom passed. But that felt different, you know? More like a hole than this... this static. (Pauses, looks down) I used to bury myself in work, just keep moving. Now even the truck feels like a chore. (Fidgets with sleeve) It’s like the weight’s always here, but back then... I don’t know. I had to be. (Trails off)

interviewer: That shift from action to stagnation sounds deeply isolating. When you buried yourself in work after your mom passed, were there specific strategies or supports that helped you push through that period?

patient: I guess... just kept moving, you know? Like, if there was a shift, I’d go. If not, I’d clean floors or something. (Pauses, avoids eye contact) My dad never taught me how to stop, I guess. But that was... that was before the static. Now even the moving feels like I’m just... spinning my wheels. (Trails off, fiddles with a loose thread on his sleeve)

interviewer: It sounds like your dad's influence left you with a way to keep going, but now you're facing a kind of stillness that feels unfamiliar. When you were able to push through challenges before, like after your mom passed, were there specific things—people, habits, or even small routines—that helped you keep moving forward?

patient: I guess... just kept going, you know? If there was work, I’d do it. If not, I’d clean floors or fix stuff. My sister... she’d call sometimes. (Pauses, avoids eye contact) But I guess I never really learned how to... stop. Now even that feels like noise. (Fidgets with sleeve, voice softens)

interviewer: It sounds like your sister’s presence was a steadying force even when things felt overwhelming. What did those calls mean to you during the tough times—like after your mom passed or when you were working through other challenges?

patient: I guess... those calls were like a lifeline, but I never wanted to be a burden. She’d talk about her day, you know? Just normal stuff. It kept me from... from completely falling apart. But now? (Fidgets with sleeve) Now even picking up the phone feels like trying to start that damn truck with the wrong key. I keep waiting for her to get tired of me, to say ‘Rodney, just stop.’ (Avoids eye contact) But I don’t call her anymore. Not since... (trails off)

interviewer: It sounds like your sister’s support was meaningful, and it’s hard to reach out now. What happened since... that made it difficult to keep calling her?

patient: I guess... it’s like I couldn’t stop thinking she’d be better off not hearing from me. (Pauses, avoids eye contact) Every time I’d almost call, I’d remember how she always had her act together—work, bills, life—and I just... I didn’t want her to hear how messed up I was. It’s like trying to fix a rusted-out frame with a screwdriver. You know it’s pointless, but you keep hoping maybe this time...

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone. What makes you think she might get tired of hearing from you?

patient: I guess... I don’t want her to hear the same old stuff. You know, like I’m just... stuck. (Fidgets with his hands) I tried fixing the truck last week, but I messed up the carburetor. It’s like I can’t even do that right anymore. (Avoids eye contact) And my dad... he’s been calling. I don’t answer. I guess I’m waiting for him to say it’s too late for me.

interviewer: It sounds like your dad's calls carry a lot of weight for you. Can you share more about what specific interactions with him make it hard to answer the phone?

patient: I guess... it’s the same thing he always says. You know, ‘You should’ve...’ or ‘If you’d just...’ (Fidgets, avoids eye contact). Even if he’s not here, the stroke changed him—can’t even talk right anymore. But the caregivers, they call every damn week. I keep thinking they’re gonna say something about me, like I should’ve done more or... or that this is my fault. (Pauses, voice cracks slightly) It’s like trying to fix a car with a broken frame. You mess with the carburetor, but the real problem’s rusted through. I just... can’t keep opening that door.

interviewer: Have you been using alcohol or cannabis more or less than usual lately?

patient: I guess... maybe a beer now and then. Doesn’t really help, though. Feels like I’m just... numbing the static. (Fidgets with hands) Not that it does any good. The noise’s still there the next day. Louder, even.

interviewer: I hear how the alcohol doesn't seem to bring relief, and that the static feels heavier afterward. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life recently?

patient: I guess... sometimes I think about how the truck’s just sitting there, rusting. Like maybe that’s how I should be, you know? Just... stop working. (Fidgets, avoids eye contact) But the static doesn’t go away. It gets louder, even. The beer? It’s like turning up the radio—same noise, just louder. I don’t... I don’t want to talk about it much. (Trails off, shrugs)

interviewer: That sounds really heavy to carry. Have you thought about a specific way this might happen for you?

patient: I guess... if the truck ever runs right again, maybe that’s when it’ll all make sense. But most days, I just... I don’t know. The static’s too loud to think straight. Feels like I’m just... turning the same damn key in a locked door. (Pauses, voice cracks) Sometimes I wonder if the engine’s even worth cranking anymore.

interviewer: That sounds really tough... it must feel so heavy to carry that uncertainty. Have you thought about any specific steps or plans to make the truck stop working, even if just in your mind?

patient: I... I guess I’ve just been taking parts off, y’know? Like if I strip it down enough, maybe it’ll stop being a joke. (Pauses, shrugs) But half the time I don’t even care if it runs. The static just... drowns everything out. (Avoids eye contact) The carburetor’s busted, and I can’t even fix that. Maybe that’s the point. (Forces a dry laugh) I was never any good with engines, I guess.

interviewer: I hear how the parts you're removing feel like they might not matter at this point. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or how much you're sleeping lately?

patient: I guess... nights are the worst. I’ll lie there till 3, staring at the ceiling. When I do get up, everything feels... heavy. Like moving my arms is a job. But if I’m at the truck, I can fake it. Pretend I’m not a robot. (Forces a dry laugh) Though half the time, I don’t even care if the damn thing runs.

interviewer: I hear how the truck metaphor carries a lot of weight for you. Have you thought about a specific way or time when you might act on these feelings of 'letting the truck stop working'?

patient: I guess... if I strip it down to the frame, maybe it’ll just collapse. But I don’t see the point in planning it out. The static’s too loud to think straight, y’know? (Shrugs, avoids eye contact) Sometimes I just... let the parts pile up. If it’s gonna rust out, it’ll do it on its own terms. (Softly) My sister calls sometimes. I don’t answer. Figure it’s better for her if I don’t make her listen to this static.

interviewer: I hear how the idea of the truck stopping feels like a distant possibility rather than a plan. Have you thought about any specific steps or methods you might use to make this happen, even if just in your mind?

patient: I guess... if I just let the carburetor sit, it’ll clog up on its own. No point in trying to fix it. (Shrugs) The static... it just drowns everything out. Sometimes I don’t even care if the parts rust. (Avoids eye contact) The truck’s already falling apart. Why bother?

interviewer: I hear how the truck's breakdown feels inevitable, like the parts just giving in to rust. Have you been using any other substances besides alcohol, like stimulants or opioids, that you feel might be affecting how you're feeling?

patient: I guess... not really. Just the beer, you know? A couple on weekends. Doesn’t count as much, right? (Pauses, avoids eye contact) It’s not like I’m chasing a high or anything. Just... dulls the static a little. (Trails off, shrugs) My dad used to say a drink was a drink, but I don’t think he’d understand this. (Looks out the window) The truck’s worse at keeping the noise out, though. At least the engine has a purpose.

interviewer: I hear how the beer feels like a temporary buffer against the static, even if it doesn’t resolve it. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, or have you started or stopped any recently?

patient: No... I’m not on no meds or supplements. Just the beer, like I said. (Shrugs, looks down) It’s not like popping pills. I don’t got time for that. The truck’s the only thing... (Trails off, fidgets with his hands) It’s got more sense than me, at least. Doesn’t need no fancy fixes.

interviewer: I hear how the truck's simplicity contrasts with the complexity of your thoughts. Have you noticed any times when you've felt unusually energetic or needed less sleep than usual recently?

patient: No... I guess not. Just the usual, you know? Tinkering with the truck sometimes keeps me up, but that’s just ’cause the noise won’t quiet down. (Shrugs, avoids eye contact) Doesn’t feel like energy—more like the static’s louder at night. I’d rather work on the engine than lie there counting cracks in the ceiling. (Trails off, fiddles with a loose thread on his sleeve) It’s not like I’m... hyper or anything. The truck’s just... all I’ve got left to anchor me.

interviewer: I hear how the noise feels louder but not accompanied by energy. Have you noticed any changes in how much you talk or if you've been feeling restless or taking risks lately?

patient: I guess... not really. Just the usual, you know? (Shrugs, fingers tapping the armrest) The truck keeps me steady, like if I focus on that, I don’t... (trails off, looks at his hands) I don’t do nothing reckless. What’s the point? The static’s bad enough already. (Voice softens) Talking? Maybe less than before. What’s the use if no one’s listenin’ anyway?

interviewer: I hear how the idea of the truck stopping feels inevitable, like the parts just giving in to rust. Have you thought about a specific way or method you might use to make the truck stop working, even if it's just in your mind?

patient: I guess... if the engine gives out, it just does. You can’t force it. (Pauses, fingers still tapping) But I’m still tightening the bolts, I guess. Doesn’t mean I’m not letting the rust win. (Avoids eye contact) The static... it’s already eating through the frame. Sometimes I think about just leaving it in the yard and letting the rain do the rest. (Shrugs) But the dog needs the yard. Can’t let him down, I guess.

interviewer: Have you had any periods lately where you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep, even if it wasn't restful?

patient: I guess not. I’ve been more like... stuck in the static. Nights are the worst—3 a.m. comes around and my mind just... hums. Can’t shut it off. The dog’s been waiting for me to take him out, but even that feels like another bolt on the truck I can’t quite tighten.

interviewer: I hear how the static makes even basic tasks feel overwhelming. Have you had any periods in the last month where you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep, even if it wasn't restful?

patient: I guess... no. It’s more like the static gets louder sometimes. I’ll try to stay up, thinking maybe if I fix another bolt on the truck, it’ll quiet down, but... (trails off, shrugs) My hands shake from the coffee I chug to stay awake, but it’s just me and the hum. The dog’s been waiting out there for days—should’ve taken him, but even that feels like stripping another bolt loose. (Avoids eye contact, fingers fidget with a loose thread on his sleeve)

interviewer: I hear how the noise feels louder but not accompanied by energy. Have you experienced any hallucinations, like hearing voices or seeing things that others don't, or had thoughts that someone is out to get you?

patient: No... I guess not. Just the static, you know? Sometimes it sounds like... a radio picking up noise between stations. But that’s probably just me. (Fidgets with his sleeve) The dog’s been waiting out there for days. I should’ve taken him. It’s just another bolt I let loosen.

interviewer: I hear how the dog waiting outside adds to the weight you're carrying. Have you noticed any physical health issues, like chronic pain or thyroid problems, that might be affecting how you're feeling?

patient: I guess... my hands shake sometimes. Coffee helps me stay awake, but it just makes the shaking worse. (Fidgets with sleeve) Lost some weight, but I don’t eat much anyway. The doc says it’s stress. (Avoids eye contact) The dog’s been waiting out there—probably needs to go—but even walking to the yard feels like... like trying to tighten a bolt that’s already stripped.

interviewer: I hear how the physical symptoms add to the weight you're carrying. Have you been evaluated for thyroid issues or other medical concerns that might be contributing to the shaking and weight loss?

patient: I guess the doc just chalks it up to stress. Shaking hands, weight... it’s all part of the noise. (Fidgets) The dog’s probably potty-trained by now—I should’ve taken him out.

interviewer: Rodney, from what you’ve shared, it sounds like you’ve been carrying a heavy emotional weight for months now—like static that won’t stop buzzing—along with trouble sleeping, losing interest in things you used to care about, and feeling stuck in a cycle of self-criticism. The eviction and losing your dad’s rod felt like a turning point, and the truck became both a lifeline and a metaphor for the effort it takes just to keep going. What did I miss or get wrong about how this has been unfolding for you?

patient: You’ve got the static right—worse at night, like it’s cranked up to 11. The truck... yeah, it’s still just a rusted shell I can’t bring myself to finish stripping. But you missed the dog, I guess. She’s been waiting by the yard for weeks, but I can’t even muster the energy to let her in. Feels like another bolt coming loose, but I keep telling myself it’s for the best. My hands shake worse now, even when I’m not drinking... maybe that’s just the static winning.

interviewer: Rodney, from what you’ve shared, it sounds like the 'static' has intensified recently—worsening at night, shaking hands even when not drinking, and the dog waiting outside while you’re too drained to care for her. These feel like pieces of the same struggle: effort feels impossible, and small responsibilities become symbols of failure. What did I miss or get wrong about how this has been unfolding for you?

patient: Yeah, the static’s still there, but... the dog. She’s been waiting out there for weeks. I can’t even bring myself to let her in. My hands shake when I try to do anything for her. Feels like another proof I’m just... broken. I guess that’s it. The rest... it’s all the same noise.

interviewer: Rodney, you’ve described the static as a persistent weight, the dog waiting outside as another symbol of your struggle with self-worth, and physical symptoms like shaking hands that make even small tasks feel impossible. What did I miss or get wrong about how this has been unfolding for you?

patient: You got the dog right. I guess... the beer on weekends is another thing. It’s like trying to drown the static, but it just sits there, you know? And the truck... I still go out there sometimes, but I can’t even start the engine.

interviewer: Rodney, from what you’ve shared, it sounds like the 'static' feels louder at night, the weekend beer isn’t helping it fade, and the truck has become a symbol of effort that feels impossible to sustain—like trying to start an engine that’s already given up. What did I miss or get wrong about how this has been unfolding for you?

patient: You got the beer and the static... I guess the truck’s just a shell now. Can’t even start it. The calls from my dad’s people... they’re there, but I don’t wanna talk about that. Hands still shake when I try to do anything. Feels like the static’s in my bones now.

interviewer: Rodney, you’ve described the static as a physical weight in your bones, the truck as a rusted shell reflecting your stuck energy, and the weekend beer as a failed attempt to quiet the noise. The dog waiting outside and calls from your dad’s people feel like added pressure you’re not ready to face. What did I miss or get wrong about how this has been unfolding for you?

patient: You... you got most of it. I guess the calls from Dad’s people—his nurses—still pile on. I don’t answer ’em. Feels like waiting for the ‘I told you so’ even if he can’t say it. And the sister... I haven’t called her back. She’s stable, and I just... I don’t wanna be that weight on her. (Hands tremble slightly.) But the static? It’s still in my bones. You got that right.

interviewer: It sounds like the calls from your dad’s people and the weight of not reaching out to your sister are adding to the static you’ve described, even as you’re trying to hold yourself together. What else might I be missing about how all of this is shaping your days or your sense of yourself?

patient: I guess... there’s the dog. She’s been waiting outside every day, but I can’t even bring myself to let her out. Feels like another thing I’m failing at. And the beer—(pauses, looks down)—it’s supposed to quiet the static, but it just sits there, doing nothing. I don’t know. It’s hard to explain.

interviewer: Rodney, putting this together, it sounds like the static has become a constant companion—louder at night, in your bones—and the dog waiting outside feels like a mirror of your self-criticism. The beer and truck both symbolize efforts to quiet or fix things that feel out of reach. What else might I be missing about how this is shaping your days or sense of yourself?

patient: I guess... the truck’s just getting harder to fix. Used to think if I could just get the engine running, maybe things would make sense again. But now even that feels impossible. (Pauses, fingers tapping the armrest) And those calls from Dad’s people—every time the phone rings, I freeze. Like they’re gonna hear me unraveling, hear how I’m just... falling apart. The dog out there? She probably thinks I’m a bad person too. (Softly) I used to think fixing the truck would prove I wasn’t broken. Now it just feels like another thing I’m gonna fail at.

interviewer: Rodney, putting this together, it sounds like the static has deepened into a sense of futility—where even small efforts feel like fighting a losing battle—and the dog waiting outside mirrors your fear of being seen as broken. What might be missing from this picture, or is there something else you’d want me to understand before we think about next steps?

patient: I guess... the hands shaking more, even when I'm not drinking. Feels like the truck's engine—no matter how hard I try, it's just... sputtering. And the dog... I don't even have the energy to let her out. It's like every little thing's another weight. I don't know. Maybe that's it—everything's just... heavy.

interviewer: Rodney, you’ve described the static as a physical weight in your bones, the truck as a rusted shell reflecting your stuck energy, and the dog waiting outside as a mirror of your self-criticism. What else might I be missing about how this is shaping your days or sense of yourself?

patient: I guess... the hands still shake, even when I’m not drinking. Feels like the truck’s engine—no spark, just sputter. And the dog... I let her out sometimes, but most days, I just... can’t. It’s like the static wins every time.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot, and I want to make sure we’ve covered everything important. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss before we wrap up today?

patient: I guess... the nights are the worst. I can’t sleep past three, and when I do wake up, it’s like the static just... roars. I used to count down to morning, but now I just count each hour, trying not to think. (Pauses) But it’s hard. Some days, I wonder if it’s easier if I just... stop trying.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry. When you say it’s easier to stop trying, do you mean it as a thought you have sometimes, or does it feel like something you’re actively considering?

patient: It’s... it’s like stripping the truck down to nothing. Once you take off the first bolt, the rest just fall. I used to think a beer or two would help, but now even that’s just... static. (Trails off, fingers tapping restless rhythm on his knee)

interviewer: It sounds like the weight of everything feels even heavier at night. Let's make sure we have a plan in place to support you through that. What steps do you feel might help with managing that static?

patient: I guess... trying to work on the truck, even if it’s just tightening one bolt. It keeps my hands busy, I guess. And the neighbor’s dog—sometimes I let her out back... but most nights, the static just... (taps fingers against thigh, pauses) The beer used to help, but now it’s like pouring water on static. Doesn’t go away. It’s just... there. (Sighs, shrugs slightly)

interviewer: That ongoing static sounds incredibly heavy to carry. As we wrap up, what steps do you think would help you feel a bit more in control, even in small ways, moving forward?

patient: I guess... if I could just focus on one bolt at a time with the truck, you know? Like, not thinking about the whole engine, just... tighten one thing. And maybe let the neighbor’s dog out once in a while. Shouldn’t be too much. (Pauses, fingers twitching on his knee) But even that feels like a chore sometimes. (Soft shrug)

interviewer: It sounds like taking on even small tasks feels like a heavy lift right now. What might be some warning signs for you that the 'static' is getting louder, or that focusing on the truck or the dog becomes too much?

patient: I guess... when the dog stops waiting for me to let her out. Like, she’s there every day, but if I just... ignore it, that’s a sign. And my hands—they shake worse when I’m trying to work on the truck. If I can’t even hold a wrench without trembling, that’s it. (Pauses, rubs his palms on his jeans) Also, if the static starts humming when I’m awake, not just at night. Like, if I can’t even focus on tightening one bolt without... (shrugs, voice trailing off) It all feels too much then.

interviewer: It sounds like identifying those warning signs is a crucial step in managing the static. What would be the first step you’d take if you noticed one of those signs emerging?

patient: I guess... I’d try to force myself to work on the truck, even if my hands are shaking. Like, just... grip the wrench real tight and pretend the rust isn’t eating through everything. (Pauses, rubs palms again) But if the dog stops waiting by the door, I don’t know. That’s the part that... (shrugs, voice fades) Feels like I’m already stripping that bolt, though.

interviewer: That moment with the dog feels like a quiet warning sign. If you notice one of those warning signs emerging, what specific steps would you take to help yourself?

patient: I guess... I try to get back to the truck. If the dog’s waiting by the door, I let her out, but my hands shake so bad sometimes I drop the leash. The beer helps a little, but it’s just... noise. The engine’s still rusted, though, so most days I just sit there. (Pauses, avoids eye contact) It’s like the dog knows—she stays quiet, but I can see her watching. Feels like another bolt coming loose if I don’t... if I don’t even do that.

interviewer: It sounds like focusing on small, manageable steps with the truck and the dog is helping you feel grounded, even when it’s hard. Before we wrap up, can you share what you think the most important next step is for you moving forward?

patient: I guess... the next step’s getting the truck’s starter fixed. Even if it’s just a few bolts a day. (Pauses, avoids eye contact) And... maybe let the dog out without leaving her waiting too long. Sounds stupid, but it’s the only thing that feels like I’m not just... giving in. (Softly) I don’t know. Maybe that’s it. Small things. Before I forget what that feels like.

interviewer: That commitment to small, meaningful steps is a strong foundation. If things feel too heavy again and even those steps become difficult, who is someone you could reach out to for support—whether it’s a friend, family member, or me?

patient: I guess... there’s that guy at the diner, Tom. He asks if I’m okay sometimes. But I don’t know. It’s hard to... (trails off, fidgets with hands) I mean, he’s not really a friend, just... keeps the coffee free. And the doc here, maybe. If I don’t fall asleep first. (Avoids eye contact) It’s just... even the thought of calling feels like trying to start that damn truck in the dark. You got to turn the key, but what if it just... doesn’t?
