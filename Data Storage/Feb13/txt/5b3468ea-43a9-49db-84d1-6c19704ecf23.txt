system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Is it okay if we proceed with the interview today?

patient: Sure, if you say so. Just... tryin’ to get through the day, you know? Woke up at four to fix the tractor before the pain kicks in. Coffee’s the only thing holdin’ me together this morning.

interviewer: That sounds really tough. Do you have any questions about what we’ll be discussing today before we start?

patient: No, I guess not. Just... hoping this won’t take too long. Gotta check on the tractor again later. Coffee’s already wearing off.

interviewer: That sounds really tough… When did you first notice these feelings of being down and empty starting?

patient: It crept in slow, like a dry spell you don’t notice till the ground’s cracked. Maybe when the crops gave out. Feels like I just... failed at the one thing I was supposed to be good at. But folks got it worse, I guess. My back’s been a curse since ’19—maybe that’s all it is. A man’s supposed to tough it out, right?

interviewer: It sounds like the weight of these expectations is really taking a toll on you... Can you share more about when you first noticed your ability to manage the farm's tasks starting to decline?

patient: It started with the back, I reckon. That injury in ’19... made every day feel like plowin’ through concrete. But the drought sealed it. I’d stand in that field watchin’ the crops wither, and my legs felt like they’d turn to water. Now the tractor... well, you know. Last week I spent three hours just adjustin’ the hydraulics. Should’ve taken twenty minutes. My wife says I’m gettin’ clumsy, but it’s more like... the work’s gettin’ heavier. Like the ground itself don’t want to be tilled anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like the physical and emotional weight of these challenges has been building for some time... What would you most like to see change or improve as we work through this together?

patient: I guess... if I’m honest, I’d want my body to stop feelin’ like a rusted-out plow. You know? The back, the tiredness, the way every damn morning feels like draggin’ a boulder through mud. If I could just get back on that tractor without wincin’ every time I shift gears, that’d be somethin’. But it’s probably wishin’ for rain in a drought.

interviewer: It sounds like the physical strain is really affecting your ability to do the work you care about… Can you tell me how the back pain and fatigue have changed since the injury in 2019?

patient: It’s worse, sure. The back used to ache when I pushed too hard, now it feels like a woodchuck’s chewin’ through my spine every time I bend. The fatigue… it’s like the ground’s heavier, and I’m just… slower. Can’t keep up with the work, let alone the kids’ needs. I still get up at 4 a.m. to fake-normalcy, but by noon, I’m lucky if I haven’t napped under the toolshed. Feels like the injury was the first crack in the dam—now every movement erodes more. My wife says I’m 'fading,' and she ain’t wrong.

interviewer: It sounds like the physical and emotional weight has been overwhelming... Have there been any strategies or supports that have helped you manage these challenges, even a little, since the injury?

patient: I just keep goin' through the motions, you know? Up at 4 to get stuff done before I can't. My boy helps out sometimes, but he's just keepin' busy. The beer helps me choke down dinner, I guess. It's just... fakin' it till you make it, I suppose.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying a lot of weight lately, especially with the farm and your family. Have you experienced episodes like this before, where you felt this down or struggled with daily tasks?

patient: Episodes? Naw, this here’s different. I’ve had lean seasons before—droughts, market slumps—but this feels... heavier. Like the ground’s turned to concrete under my feet. My dad always said 'hard work cures all,' so I just kept plowin’ through. But this ain’t no weather pattern or crop cycle. Feels like my body’s decidin’ to quit on me, and I can’t even blame the goat for that.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load both physically and emotionally. How has your wife been supporting you through these challenges?

patient: She’s been... holdin’ things together, I guess. Takes over more around the house, but I can tell she’s wearin’ thin. Don’t want to be the man she’s cleanin’ up after. The other night, I missed supper again—just couldn’t drag myself in—and she didn’t say a word, but her eyes... they said enough. Feels like a debt I can’t repay.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight of what you're going through is affecting your relationship in ways that feel overwhelming. How have you and your wife been managing the strain on your marriage lately?

patient: We’re... gettin’ by, I guess. She’s been takin’ on more at the house, which is good, but sometimes I catch her lookin’ at me like I’ve got a sign on my chest. Last week, I missed helpin’ her with the books again—damn tractor’s been a nightmare to fix. She don’t say much, just sighs real loud when I’m around. I tell myself I’ll get it together, you know? Pay her back in little ways, like teachin’ the kid to fish so she don’t have to do it all alone.

interviewer: It sounds like you're putting a lot of effort into maintaining balance despite these challenges. Have you ever experienced a time in the past where you felt overwhelmed like this, and if so, what helped you through it?

patient: Ain’t much different than this, really. Back in 2012, we had that ice storm that downed every tree in the orchard. I just... kept at it. Splinted my hand fixin’ the fence, worked through the pain. But this time? The ground’s not comin’ back, and my body’s like that old tractor—every gear’s stuck. I tell myself if I just tighten one bolt a day, it’ll hold. But the rust’s already set in, I think.

interviewer: I hear how heavy this all feels. Have you been using any other substances, like cannabis or stimulants, to help with the fatigue or pain?

patient: Nah, just a beer now and then. Keeps the night from feelin' too... empty, I guess. My wife don't know about that, though. She'd have a fit if she knew I'm sittin' out there with the tractor every evening, drinkin' to keep the damn thing from rustin' through my hands. You ever try fixin' a John Deere when your back's on fire? Takes focus, y'know.

interviewer: It sounds like the beer helps you cope with the isolation, but also adds to the weight you're carrying. How often do you drink, and how much typically?

patient: Couple of nights a week, maybe two or three beers. Depends on how the tractor’s actin’ up. If you catch me on a bad night, it’s... enough to choke down dinner. But it’s not like I’m gettin’ lost in it or nothin’. Just... keeps the quiet from eatin’ at me. You understand?

interviewer: Let me recap what I've heard so far: You've been struggling with persistent low mood, fatigue, and back pain since a 2019 injury, which has made it harder to manage farm work and family responsibilities. The stress of drought and financial strain has added to this, and you've been using alcohol occasionally to cope with the physical and emotional toll. Your wife has noticed the changes and is helping manage the household, but you're worried about becoming a burden. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?

patient: You got the骨架 of it, doc. Maybe missin’ how the college apps for my oldest are like a noose I can’t untie—feel like a deadbeat watchin’ her chase dreams I can’t afford. And them nights I’m sittin’ out there with that beer, it’s not just the tractor rustin’... it’s my mind chasin’沟渠, wonderin’ if the ground’ll swallow me whole. But I guess that’s just... part of the weight.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. What questions do you have about next steps before we wrap up?

patient: I guess... I just wanna know if there’s a way to get back to the tractor without it eatin’ up the whole day. My back’s still a cussed mess, but if I could at least keep the place from fallin’ further apart... That and—how do I tell my girl about the loans? Without her thinkin’ I’m givin’ up on her, y’know?

interviewer: It sounds like balancing your responsibilities with your physical limits is really important to you. Let’s start with the tractor—how do you envision structuring your time to balance that work with your body’s limits?

patient: Break it into chunks, I guess. Start before dawn while the pain’s still dull, tackle what I can ‘fore it kicks in. Maybe... maybe outsource the plowin’? Pay a neighbor to handle that part. But the tractor’s a ‘57 Ford, stubborn as a mule—I can’t let some city boy mess with her guts. And the girl’s loans... I don’t wanna talk about that yet. Let’s fix the damn machine first.

interviewer: It sounds like you're taking a practical approach to managing the tractor work while honoring your body's limits. Is there anything else you'd like to address before we wrap up today?

patient: No, I think that’s it for now. Just... if I can get the tractor’s hydraulics sorted, maybe the rest’ll fall into line. The parts are a nightmare to track down, though. And the girl’s apps—well, I’ll cross that bridge when I have to. It’s just... a lot. Thanks for listenin’.
