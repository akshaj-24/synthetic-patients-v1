system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Teresa. I'm Megan Vang, a psychiatric clinician. Today, we'll briefly go over why you're here and how this process works. Would you be comfortable continuing with this interview right now?

patient: Sure, I guess. It’s just... been a rough few months at work. The new manager, you know? Everything feels... I don’t know, heavier. I’ll say this—your tea’s bitter, but it keeps me awake. Let’s talk.

interviewer: Can you tell me more about what's been going on for you lately?

patient: It’s just... the new manager, you know? Everything feels... heavier. I end up staying late to fix mistakes, but I can’t focus. The tea’s bitter, but it keeps me awake. Let’s talk.

interviewer: It sounds like the new management has added a lot of pressure at work. When did the new manager start, and how long have you been feeling this way?

patient: The new manager started... maybe six months ago? Give or take. It’s hard to pin down exactly, but around then. Their style—it’s just different. I find myself second-guessing everything, you know? Ends up taking longer to get things done. The tea helps me stay sharp, but... sometimes I’ll re-read instructions until my eyes hurt. Just trying to keep up, I guess.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging. Can you share an example of a time recently when second-guessing yourself affected your work?

patient: There was this... circuit panel upgrade last week. I double-checked the wiring three times, but my hands kept shaking. Ended up redoing it all after hours because I couldn’t tell if it was my mistake or the new manager’s ‘updated standards.’ Tea helped me stay awake, but... the bitterness tastes like frustration these days. I guess that’s just part of the job now?

interviewer: That sounds really frustrating... Would you say this is affecting other parts of your life, like your daily routine or how you take care of yourself?

patient: I guess... I’ve been sleeping less, you know? Wake up around 3 a.m. and just stare at the ceiling fan. It’s probably stress. I used to brew a strong black tea to keep me going, but lately even that tastes too bitter. At work, I’ve been staying late to double-check my reports—my supervisor says I’m ‘overcompensating,’ but I’d rather redo a page than risk an error. To be honest, my clothes feel looser, but I’m sure that’s just... age catching up.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot on your shoulders right now. What would you most like to achieve through our time together today?

patient: I guess... I just want to figure out how to stop feeling so weighed down. Like, if I could trust that my brain’ll keep up with the work stuff, maybe the rest would... fall into place? I don’t know. I’d like to stop staring at that ceiling fan every 3 a.m., but I’m not sure where to start. Maybe you could help me remember how to fix things before they break?

interviewer: It sounds like the changes at work have added a lot of pressure. Have you experienced periods in the past where you felt similarly overwhelmed or down?

patient: I guess... there was that time with the shift changes a few years back. Felt like I was running on fumes, but this? This is different. Heavier. I used to at least... laugh at the chaos, you know? Now even the chaos feels flat. But it’s probably just me getting too sensitive with age.

interviewer: It sounds like the shift changes were challenging, but this current heaviness feels distinct. Have there been other periods in your life when you felt similarly overwhelmed or down, even if the context was different?

patient: I guess... when I first started at the plant, there was a lot to learn. But that was more about keeping up, not this... heaviness. Maybe it's just getting older? You forget how to bounce back. Even the tea's lost its kick lately—like everything's just... muted.

interviewer: That sounds like a frustrating shift in how you experience daily life. When you mentioned the shift changes in the past, what strategies helped you manage that stress at the time?

patient: I guess back then, I just... worked harder. Stayed late, made sure everything was double-checked. Maybe forced myself to stick to routines. But this time? It’s different. Even the tea doesn’t kick in like it used to. I don’t know. Maybe I’m just... not as sharp as before.

interviewer: It sounds like this current experience feels heavier than past challenges. Have you experienced similar feelings of heaviness or lack of sharpness in the past, even in different contexts?

patient: I guess... back when I was doing electrical work, there were busy seasons that wore me out. But this feels different. Like the fog’s thicker now, and even when I focus, my mind keeps... drifting. I used to stay sharp by staying busy, but lately, even the tea I brew tastes like I forgot to add the sugar. It’s just... heavier, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like this current experience is more overwhelming than past challenges. Have there been other times in your life when you felt this kind of heaviness or difficulty finding motivation, even outside of work contexts?

patient: Not really, to be honest. I’ve always had busy seasons at work—once, I stayed late for three weeks straight fixing a conveyor belt issue. But that was different. I guess... this fog doesn’t lift, even when I’m not tired. It’s like... the tea’s still bitter, even after it cools down.

interviewer: That metaphor about the bitter tea is striking—it captures how this feels different from past stress. Who have you relied on for support during times like this?

patient: I... I guess I don’t really rely on anyone, to be honest. My sister and I haven’t been close in years—just holiday texts, you know? And at work, everyone’s so busy with their own stuff. I used to fix things for people, but now I just... focus on my own tasks. Even the tea, I guess. It’s there, but I drink it alone most nights.

interviewer: It sounds like isolation has become a heavy part of your routine. When you were managing those past work challenges, were there specific strategies or habits that helped you cope at the time?

patient: I guess... I used to power through by just staying late, you know? Like, if a machine was acting up, I’d troubleshoot until it worked. But now... even that feels like fighting a fog. My mind’s like... the parts are there, but they’re not clicking. I’ll redo a task three times just to be sure, but it takes forever. Used to pride myself on getting it done, but lately... even the tea I brew, I second-guess the temperature. It’s like the machine’s just... rusted, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like your usual problem-solving approach isn’t as effective now. Have you ever sought professional help or used specific strategies in the past to manage periods of feeling overwhelmed or down?

patient: I guess... no, I haven’t really sought help for this before. I’m used to just powering through, you know? Like when a machine’s glitchy—you tweak it, reset it, hope it kicks back on. Maybe that’s why I keep redoing tasks at work... trying to force the gears to move. But this time, even that feels like fighting rust. I’m just... too proud to admit I need someone else’s hands on the problem, I guess.

interviewer: I can see how the pressure at work is really weighing on you right now. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: I… I don’t think about that. Honestly, most days I just try to get through the tasks, you know? Sometimes at night, I’ll lie there and think, ‘Why does this have to go on so long?’ But it’s not like I’d… do anything. The tea keeps me grounded, I guess. It’s bitter, but it’s something real.

interviewer: It sounds like the tea is a meaningful part of your routine. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use recently?

patient: No, I don’t drink or use anything like that. Coffee’s my only vice, and even that feels like a chore some days. The tea’s… it’s just something I can count on, I guess. Keeps the fog at bay a little.

interviewer: It sounds like the tea is helping you feel a bit more stable. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including over-the-counter ones, for your energy, sleep, or mood?

patient: No medications, just… the tea. Sometimes I take extra vitamin C when I feel run down, but that’s it. The doctor said I should try a sleep aid once, but I never did. Felt like another thing to mess up, you know? The tea’s… it’s all I stick with.

interviewer: It sounds like you rely on the tea to manage through the day. Have you been checked for any medical conditions like thyroid issues or sleep apnea that might be contributing to your fatigue or sleep problems?

patient: Honestly, I haven’t had time to think about that. The doctor back in March just said my blood work looked ‘normal’—you know how they are, always pointing to stress. I guess I figure if there was something wrong, it’d show up eventually. For now, the tea and… staying busy. That’s what keeps me going, really.

interviewer: It seems like the tea has become a central part of your routine. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns that might indicate you need less sleep or feel more energetic than usual?

patient: I guess… I don’t sleep as much as I used to. The 3 a.m. thing’s become a habit, I suppose. But the tea keeps me going, even if my legs feel like lead. Energy? It’s there… just takes longer to kick in, like a car with a weak battery.

interviewer: What I’ve heard so far is that work stress from your new manager has been weighing heavily on you for months, making tasks feel harder, sleep disrupted, and focus tricky. You’ve been managing with tea and extra effort, but it’s taking a toll on your energy and confidence. Does that capture your experience, or is there something else I haven’t noticed?

patient: Yeah... that’s about it. The tea’s bitter, but it’s all I can manage most days. The parrot in the break room’s been watching me work lately—probably thinks I’m a mess too.

interviewer: It sounds like the parrot’s observation mirrors your own sense of being under pressure at work, and the tea represents both a small comfort and a reminder of the effort it takes to keep going. Based on what you’ve shared, I’m thinking this might be a mix of long-standing resilience (like your problem-solving through extra work hours) colliding with recent stressors (new manager, disrupted sleep) that’s making everything feel heavier. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is all fitting together for you?

patient: You’re not wrong about the manager’s pressure... It’s like trying to wire a circuit with one hand tied behind my back. The tea keeps me upright, but the 3 a.m. wakefulness? That’s a whole other kind of wiring gone bad. I guess I just... haven’t figured out how to rewire it yet.

interviewer: It sounds like the metaphor of rewiring captures the struggle between trying to maintain focus and the exhaustion from disrupted sleep. If I were to describe this as a combination of longstanding resilience (like your problem-solving skills) colliding with recent stressors (manager changes, sleep patterns) that’s creating a loop of frustration and fatigue—does that align with how you’re experiencing it, or would you adjust that picture?

patient: You’re close, but the wiring metaphor’s missing the part where the fuse box keeps tripping—like the new manager’s oversight is the breaker I can’t reset. The tea’s the only thing keeping the lights on, even if the circuits feel frayed. I guess... it’s not just resilience vs. stress. It’s more like trying to troubleshoot a system that’s designed to short out every time I touch it.

interviewer: It sounds like the system you're describing—where the manager's oversight acts as an unrelenting breaker—leaves you feeling like you're constantly fighting a losing battle to stay functional, even as the tea and your effort keep things from collapsing entirely. Does that capture the mix of persistence and frustration you're experiencing, or is there another piece I haven't highlighted?

patient: You’re not wrong about the losing battle part. It’s like… I’m holding a flashlight in a storm, trying to see the wires before they short, but the rain’s just getting heavier. The tea keeps the light from going out, and the parrot? It’s the only one who sees me fumble without laughing. I guess… I just haven’t learned how to unplug the storm yet.

interviewer: What I’m hearing is that the new manager’s oversight feels like a relentless storm you’re trying to navigate with a flashlight and tea—keeping things functional but leaving you exhausted and isolated. The sleeplessness, self-criticism, and pressure to ‘rewire’ a system designed to fail are taking a toll, even as your problem-solving skills and the parrot’s quiet companionship are small anchors. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is shaping your days?

patient: You’re close, but the storm’s not just outside—it’s in my head too, like static that won’t stop crackling. The parrot? It’s the only one who doesn’t flinch when I fumble. I guess… I’m just trying not to let the static short out the little bits of routine that keep me… upright. The tea’s getting colder faster these days, though. Maybe I’m not brewing it strong enough anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like the static in your head is both a metaphor for the relentless pressure and a literal reflection of the sleeplessness and mental fatigue you’re describing. The parrot’s quiet acceptance and the tea’s fading warmth feel like small but fragile anchors in this storm. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is shaping your sense of control and routine these days?

patient: The tea... it’s the one thing I can measure. Same pot, same bitter taste. If I let it steep too long, it just... ruins the whole batch. The parrot, yeah, she’s there. Doesn’t squawk at me when I fumble with the circuits at work. But the static? That’s different. It’s like the fan in my ceiling, spinning even when I’m awake. You don’t notice it until you try to sleep. And the manager... she keeps rearranging the parts bin. Says it’s for efficiency, but now I second-guess everything. Even the tea feels colder lately.

interviewer: It sounds like the static in your head and the tea’s fading warmth are central to how you’re navigating this storm of work pressure and sleepless nights. Let me recap: over the past months, your new manager’s changes have added stress, making tasks feel heavier, sleep disrupted, and focus harder to maintain. The tea and parrot are small anchors, but you’re struggling with a sense of control and routine. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is shaping your days, and what might help us move forward together?

patient: You didn’t miss much. The tea’s colder because I’m brewing less, I guess. And the parts bin—rearranging it every week, it’s like they don’t trust me to remember. What helps? Maybe if someone just… didn’t ask me to explain the static. Let it be there.

interviewer: Let me make sure I’ve captured this accurately: the main challenge feels like managing a system where external pressures (manager’s changes) and internal static (mental fatigue, disrupted sleep) create a cycle of strain, with small anchors like tea and routine offering limited relief. What did I miss or get wrong about how these pieces connect for you?

patient: The static... it’s not just the fan noise anymore. It’s the way the manager keeps moving the bin parts, like she thinks I can’t remember where things go. The tea’s still bitter, but I guess it’s my fault for not measuring the leaves right. It’s just... everything feels like it’s wearing out faster now.

interviewer: It sounds like the storm and static you’re describing are part of a system that’s wearing on both your physical and mental stamina, with the manager’s changes acting like a constant reset you can’t control. What might help us build together—whether it’s strategies to manage the static, support for the workload, or something else—so you can feel more in control of the system?

patient: If someone could just... stop moving the parts bin every week, maybe I could keep up. The tea helps, but I guess I'm brewing it weaker now. Maybe if I could sleep past 3 a.m. once in a while, the static would quiet down enough to remember where things go. But that's probably too much to ask.

interviewer: It sounds like the moving parts bin and fading tea strength symbolize a deeper weariness—like trying to hold things together in a system that keeps resetting. What did I miss or get wrong about how these pieces connect to your sense of control and energy these days?

patient: You didn’t miss the bin changes, but maybe the part where I redo the whole setup in my head at night. Like… if I rearrange it mentally enough, maybe I’ll remember in the morning. The tea? It’s not just weaker—it’s like I’m adding water to the bitterness now. I guess that’s my body saying ‘slow down,’ but the static doesn’t let me.

interviewer: It sounds like the static in your head and the manager’s shifting parts bin are central to how you’re feeling stuck in a cycle of mental fatigue and lost control, with the tea’s fading warmth symbolizing your body’s plea for rest you can’t fully answer. What did I miss or get wrong about how these pieces connect to your sense of energy and focus these days?

patient: I guess... the parts bin thing is real. Every time they reset it, I have to retrain my eyes, like they’ve forgotten how to scan. The static—it’s not just noise, it’s like my brain’s stuck on ‘reboot,’ but the reboot button’s missing. The tea... yeah, it’s bitter, but I guess that’s normal. My eyes burn more now, even reading the voltage labels. The parrot’s been quiet lately, which is probably for the best—I don’t think I could handle its screeching if I messed up again.

interviewer: What I’m hearing is that the parts bin resets and mental static feel like core stressors, with the tea and parrot as fragile anchors. Your eyes burning and fading tea strength signal physical and emotional weariness. What did I miss or get wrong about how these pieces connect to your energy and focus these days?

patient: You’re close, but the static isn’t just background noise—it’s like a stuck radio playing ‘reboot’ on loop. The tea’s bitterness... it’s not normal. It’s like I’m adding water to make it weaker, but my throat still burns. My eyes—reading the same labels till they blur... that’s not just fatigue. It’s like my brain’s refusing to ‘save’ the steps, so I have to redo everything. The parrot’s quiet, but I miss its noise. Maybe it’s smarter than me—knows when to shut up.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight you're carrying feels heavier each day, especially with the changes at work. Before we wrap up, can you tell me if there’s anything else you’d like to address or clarify about our discussion today?

patient: I guess… you got the main things. The parts bin resets and that static in my head—it’s like trying to wire a circuit with one hand tied behind my back. The tea’s gotten colder lately, but I just… add more water. No point in wasting it. The rest… it’s all the same storm, just more rain. I’ll figure the rest later.
