system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Is it okay if we start our session today, Kristen?

patient: Yeah, sure. I mean, it’s not like I got a choice, right? Just... my shoulders are killin’ me today. Can we maybe not talk too long? I’ve got a stack of laundry that’s been waitin’ since yesterday, and you know how kids are—always needin’ somethin’.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to balance everything. Are you comfortable proceeding with our session today?

patient: Yeah, I'm here. Shoulders still feel like someone's hammerin' nails, but... whatever. Just don't wanna waste time, y'know? Kids and all.

interviewer: That sounds really tough balancing everything. Does that sound okay to you, or do you have any questions before we start?

patient: Yeah, I guess. Shoulders are still killin’ me, though. You know how it is. Neighbor’s music’s been drivin’ me nuts lately—can’t even think straight sometimes. But... we can talk.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. Today, we’ll be talking about what’s been going on for you so we can figure out how to help. Does that sound okay?

patient: Yeah, I guess... Neighbor’s music doesn’t help. Sleep’s been... fragmented. You know how it is. Kids needin’ stuff, and I’m just tryin’ to keep up. Not much else to say, I guess.

interviewer: Can you tell me about the main things that have been concerning you lately?

patient: It’s the neighbor’s music, y’know? Can’t even sleep straight. My shoulders are killing me, and I’m just… I guess I’m not sleeping right. To be honest, it’s all kinda overlapping—work, the kids. I’m sure it’s just me being too sensitive, though. Mark says I should just ‘chill,’ but how do you even…?

interviewer: It sounds like the combination of work, family, and the neighbor's music has been really taxing on your body and mind. When did you first start noticing these sleep problems and physical tension?

patient: I guess it started when I had to take those extra shifts after Mark lost his job. My shoulders just got tighter and tighter, and I’d lie there at night, my mind racing. To be honest, I don’t remember the last time I felt fully rested. It’s not just that noise next door, it’s all of it—just nonstop.

interviewer: It sounds like this stress is really taking a toll on your daily life. How has it affected your ability to take care of yourself or manage household responsibilities lately?

patient: I guess I just can’t focus like I used to. At work, I messed up a shipment the other day—numbers just… blurry, y’know? My hands are killing me from scrubbing the counters till they shine, but it’s like I can’t even finish a task without my mind jumping to the next problem. To be honest, I snapped at Mark again last night over something dumb. I tell myself it’s just tiredness, but… it’s like the weight’s always there, making everything take twice as long. I’m sure I’ll get it together eventually, though.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure is really affecting your focus and relationships. When did you first start noticing difficulty focusing at work?

patient: I guess it was around the time I started those extra shifts. My brain just… foggy, y’know? Numbers would blur, and my hands would shake when I tried to scan things. To be honest, that shipment mess? That was me trying to power through, but my eyes were so tired I couldn’t focus. It’s not like I’m slacking—I’m just… I guess I’m a mess when I’m stretched too thin.

interviewer: That sounds exhausting and frustrating. What are you hoping to achieve through this visit or with support right now?

patient: I guess… I just want to figure out how to not feel so stuck. Like, how do I stop my head from racing so much? I don’t expect a miracle, but if I could sleep a few hours without my shoulders screaming or without that neighbor’s music drilling into me… Maybe then I could actually think straight long enough to not mess up at work. I’m a mess, what’dya expect?

interviewer: It sounds like the racing thoughts are making it hard to focus on tasks that matter. Can you share an example of when your mind was so busy it interfered with something you needed to do?

patient: I guess the other night, I was trying to finish a shipment at work, but my head was just… all over the place. Keep thinking about the neighbor’s music keeping me up, the kids’ meds, and if I even bought soap for the laundromat. To be honest, I mixed up the inventory numbers—something I never do. My hands were all shaky, and I kept clenching my shoulder so hard it hurt. Ended up having to ask a coworker to check my list, and I felt like such a failure for messing up. Just… I guess it’s all too much sometimes.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been under a lot of pressure lately. Have you experienced similar periods of stress or anxiety in the past where you sought help or found certain strategies helpful?

patient: Not really... I mean, when Mark lost his job last year, I just told myself to work harder, you know? To be honest, I used to drink more back then—thought it’d help me sleep. But it’s different now. The kids, the neighbor’s noise... it’s like my head’s stuck on repeat. I guess I just... I tell myself I should be able to handle it. My mom used to say the same thing. But then I see that report card in my purse and... I don’t know. What if I’m not doing right by them?

interviewer: It sounds like you carry a lot of responsibility for your family’s well-being. Can you share more about how your mom’s approach to stress influenced how you’ve handled things over time?

patient: I guess... my mom always said, 'Life don’t hand you lemons, you just gotta squeeze harder.' To be honest, that stuck with me. When things got tough, I just kept working, thinking if I tried harder, everything’d... balance out. But now? My shoulders are like concrete, and I can’t even sleep through the night. The other day, I looked at that report card in my purse—straight A’s—and just... snapped at Mark for burning the toast. I don’t know. What if I’m teaching my kids to bottle everything up?

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry as a parent. Can you share what you usually do when you start feeling overwhelmed like that?

patient: I guess... I just try to push through, you know? To be honest, I’ll drink a glass or two of that cheap wine—calls it ‘medicine’—to quiet the noise in my head. But it don’t really help. The neighbor’s music always kicks back in, keeps me up... and my shoulders just lock up tighter. Sometimes I’ll mess with the garden, but my hands shake so bad I end up snapping the stems. It’s not enough, though. Never enough.

interviewer: It sounds like your efforts to manage stress have become really physically and emotionally taxing. Can you share more about the people or resources that have helped you feel supported during these tough times?

patient: I guess... Mark tries to help, but I don’t wanna make him worry. To be honest, I just... keep it all inside. My daughter’s report card—it’s in my purse, you know? That’s the only thing that makes me feel like maybe I’m doing something right. But then I think, what if the neighbor’s music gives the kids headaches? What if my shaky hands mess up dinner again? It’s not... it’s not like there’s anyone else to talk to. My mom’s too busy with her new boyfriend to understand. My shoulders just... lock up tighter every day.

interviewer: I notice you mentioned using alcohol as a way to cope with stress. Have you used any other substances, like cannabis, stimulants, or opioids, either now or in the past? If so, how has your use changed recently?

patient: No, just the wine, really. It's not like I'm out there... you know, doing anything else. That cheap stuff's about all I can afford anyway. Helps me unclench a little, but honestly? It's just a bandaid. The noise next door still cuts through it, and my hands shake worse when I wake up. To be honest, I guess I'd try anything if it meant not feeling like a coiled spring all the time.

interviewer: It sounds like the wine isn’t helping much with the physical symptoms you’re experiencing. Have you ever had thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life?

patient: I guess... sometimes I imagine just passing out and not waking up. But that’s just drivel, right? I wouldn’t do anything stupid. The kids need me, even if I feel like I’m one mistake away from losing it. To be honest... it’s not like I’d blame them if I did break, though.

interviewer: It sounds like the thought of passing out and not waking up is something that worries you deeply, even if you don’t see it as a real risk. Have you ever thought about a specific way this might happen, or do you see it as more of a hope that things might just stop feeling this heavy?

patient: No, it’s not like that. Just... sometimes when the noise is too loud and the wine doesn’t kick in, I guess I wonder if it all just stops. But it’s not real, you know? It’s just... this weight I can’t lift. The kids need me, even if I feel like I’m one mistake away from losing it.

interviewer: That weight you mentioned feels really heavy—can you tell me if you’ve ever noticed times when you feel unusually energetic or need less sleep than usual, even when stressed?

patient: No, ma'am. I'm just plain tired. I don't get that kind of energy. Even when I'm wiped, I keep going 'cause the kids need me. But it's not like I'm feeling hyper or nothing. Just... drained. My body's all coiled up, you know? Even the wine don't fix that.

interviewer: I hear how physically exhausting this has been for you. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal remedies, to help with your symptoms?

patient: No, ma'am. Just the wine, really. Sometimes I take some ibuprofen for the shoulder knots, but that's about it. Doesn't really help much, to be honest... feels like pouring water on a flood, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like the physical discomfort and stress have been really persistent for you. Have you ever experienced any unusual thoughts or perceptions, like seeing or hearing things that others don’t, or believing things that might not be true even when there’s evidence against it?

patient: I guess... I don’t know. Sometimes when I’m dead tired, things feel off, like my head’s full of static. But that’s just me, right? My neighbor’s music probably doesn’t help—I’ll swear I hear their TV when it’s just the radio or whatever. And my shoulders? They feel like concrete sometimes. But I don’t see or hear things that aren’t there. Just... stuck in my own storm, I guess.

interviewer: Kristen, based on our conversation, it sounds like your stress from work, family responsibilities, and the noisy neighbor has been contributing to your sleep issues, physical tension, and reliance on alcohol to cope. We also talked about how your worries about your kids and pressure to 'keep it together' might be making things worse, while your commitment to them is a strength. What did I miss here?

patient: I guess... there’s the kids’ health stuff. What if something happens to them? I don’t sleep ‘cause I’m up worrying, but I don’t wanna complain ‘bout it. And that report card in my purse? It’s like a lifeline, but what if it’s not enough? I try not to think about it. And the wine... it’s not a big deal, but sometimes I wonder if it’s just... delaying the collapse. You know?

interviewer: It sounds like the report card represents both pride and pressure for you, and the wine feels like a temporary fix but also a source of guilt. What did I miss here?

patient: I guess... there’s the asthma with my son. Haven’t said much ‘cause it feels like my fault. And the wine? It’s not helping like it used to. I just... don’t wanna think about failing them. You know how it goes.

interviewer: It sounds like your son's asthma and the wine's diminishing effectiveness are adding to your sense of failure and guilt. What else might I have missed in this picture?

patient: I guess... there’s the way my head feels like a flood, you know? Like I’m trying to plug holes with my hands, but they’re just shaking too bad. My dad left when I was little—always thought if I just held on harder, nobody’d disappear. Now it’s like... what if I’m not holding on enough? The noise next door just... it’s always there, like the flood’s never stopping. I don’t know.

interviewer: It sounds like your father's absence when you were young has shaped how you experience holding on to relationships now, adding to the pressure you feel as a parent. What did I miss here?

patient: I guess... it’s like I’m always gripping, you know? Like if I let go, everything cracks. The report card’s in my purse—every A feels like proof I’m doing okay, but what if it slips? The noise next door? It’s always there, like the flood’s never stopping. I try not to think about the asthma, but... it’s another hole to plug. To be honest, I’m just scared I’m not holding on enough.

interviewer: It sounds like your fear of letting go and the pressure to hold everything together is deeply tied to your father's absence, the noisy neighbor's constant stress, your son's asthma, and the wine feeling like an unreliable shield. What did I miss here?

patient: I guess you didn’t miss the part where I’m scared I’ll drop the ball with the asthma stuff… but it’s not like I can just magic up a cure or no. And the noise next door? Feels like they’re drilling into my skull every night. I try to… to focus on the garden or the wine, but my head’s always stuck on ‘what if the kid’s next asthma attack is the worst one?’ You know? It’s just… another thing to screw up.

interviewer: Kristen, putting this all together, it seems your worries about your son’s asthma, the relentless noise from your neighbor, and the way wine no longer eases your stress are all part of a pattern where you feel like you’re constantly trying to hold everything together but fearing you’ll fail. The pressure to avoid mistakes—and the guilt when you feel you’ve slipped—seems tied to your dad’s absence and your determination not to lose anyone else. What did I miss here?

patient: You didn’t miss… the part where I feel like I’m choking on the guilt about the asthma. I mean, how do I even start telling Mark? It’s like… like trying to explain why the fence keeps leaning when the ground’s all messed up. And the neighbor’s music? It’s not just the noise—it’s the way it makes me jump, like my nerves are all frayed. The wine used to help, but now it’s just… a Band-Aid on a broken pipe. To be honest, I guess what’s missing is that I’m scared I’ll mess up the garden too, you know? Like every little thing’s another crack in the dam.

interviewer: It sounds like the garden adds another layer to your fears of failing. What would be most helpful for us to focus on next?

patient: I guess… the noise next door. It’s like they’re drilling into my skull every night, you know? Even when I’m trying to focus on the garden or the report card, that music cracks through. To be honest… I’m scared I’ll snap at Mark again, or worse, miss another warning sign with the kid’s asthma. It’s not that I don’t try—I just… my hands are shaking too much to hold it all.

interviewer: It sounds like the neighbor’s noise is making it hard to stay calm and focused, especially with Mark and the asthma worries. What else feels important to include about how this is affecting you?

patient: I guess… it’s the way it steals my sleep, you know? Even when I’m passed out, that music feels like it’s still… drilling through the walls. I can’t rest right, so I’m just… irritable all the time. snapped at Mark last week over something stupid, and then felt awful but couldn’t fix it. My head’s always racing—what if I mess up the garden? What if I miss another asthma sign?—and the noise just… it’s like trying to build a fence in a hurricane. My hands shake so bad sometimes, I can’t even prune the herbs without snapping the stems.

interviewer: It sounds like the noise from your neighbor is intensifying your sleeplessness and shaking, making it harder to stay calm with Mark and manage your son’s asthma worries. The garden feels like another place you might ‘mess up,’ adding to the pressure. What did I miss here?

patient: I guess… the part you’re missing is the report card in my purse. It’s all A’s, but I just… can’t let myself feel proud. What if I slip up and she ends up like her brother? What if the asthma gets worse and I’m too shook to notice? The wine used to mute it, but now… my hands tremble so bad, I can’t even hold the glass steady. To be honest, I’m scared the neighbor’s music’s gonna be the thing that makes me snap completely.

interviewer: It sounds like the report card, your son’s asthma, the neighbor’s noise, and your trembling hands are all part of a pattern where you feel like you’re constantly balancing on a tightrope—trying to hold everything together while fearing you’ll drop something. What did I miss here?

patient: I guess that’s… not wrong. It’s like trying to hold a fraying rope with one hand while the other’s stuck in cement. The report card’s a good thing, really—it’s just… what if she slips? What if I slip? And that neighbor’s music? It’s not even loud, just… persistent. Like a leak you can’t fix. My hands shake sometimes when I’m trying to do the right thing, you know? Clenchin’ my shoulders so tight it hurts. I drink a little to… soften the edges. But it’s all just… static. I’m a mess, what’dya expect?

interviewer: It sounds like your worries about the report card, the neighbor’s noise, your trembling hands, and the wine’s ineffectiveness are all part of a pattern where you feel like you’re trying to hold everything together while fearing you’ll fail. What did I miss here?

patient: I guess… I haven’t really said how bad it is with my son’s asthma. It’s not even the attacks themselves—it’s the what-ifs. What if I’m not there when he needs his inhaler? What if I forget to check his symptoms and he’s in trouble and I don’t notice? I feel like I should’ve known better, like it’s my fault he’s fragile. And the neighbor’s music? It’s like they’re drilling through the floorboards of my sanity. I try to focus on the garden, on *The Golden Girls*… but the guilt just… pools in my chest. I’m a mess, what’dya expect?

interviewer: It sounds like your son's asthma and the neighbor's noise are intensifying your guilt and fear of failing your family, even as the wine no longer helps. What would you like us to focus on next in terms of support or next steps for your care?

patient: I guess… maybe start with the noise? That neighbor’s music feels like it’s wired into my skull now. And the guilt—it’s not even about the asthma medicine, it’s the *what if I mess up again* that knots my shoulders up. I tried the garden, you know? It’s nice, but the ground’s still frozen half the time. Maybe… there’s something between the noise and the guilt that’s… static. I just want the static to stop long enough to think straight.

interviewer: Kristen, based on our conversation, it sounds like your stress from work, family responsibilities, and the noisy neighbor has been contributing to your sleep issues, physical tension, and reliance on alcohol to cope. We also talked about how your worries about your kids and pressure to 'keep it together' might be making things worse, while your commitment to them is a strength. What did I miss here?

patient: I guess… maybe it’s the way I’ve always been, you know? My dad left when I was 12, and I’ve just figured stability’s something you *earn* by gripping tight. Like… if I relax for a second, everything’ll crumble. And sometimes I just wanna *stop* thinkin’, but that’s drivel, right? The wine don’t help no more, but… what’s the point of sleep when the monkeys won’t quit? I’m just… tired.

interviewer: It sounds like your fear of letting go—rooted in your father’s absence—and the pressure to hold everything together is intensifying your anxiety about your son’s asthma, the neighbor’s noise, and your physical exhaustion, even as the wine no longer helps. What did I miss here?

patient: Yeah… my dad left, so I guess I figured if I just grip tight enough, nothing else’ll fall apart. But the neighbor’s music? It’s like it’s in my bones now. And my hands… they shake even when I’m tryin’ to hold still. The wine don’t even touch it anymore. I’m a mess, what’dya expect?

interviewer: It sounds like your fear of letting go—rooted in your father’s absence—and the pressure to hold everything together is intensifying your anxiety about your son’s asthma, the neighbor’s noise, and your physical exhaustion, even as the wine no longer helps. What would you like us to focus on next in terms of support or next steps for your care?

patient: I guess... figuring out how to actually rest without the wine? And maybe not feel like my head's gonna explode from that neighbor's music. But it's probably too much to ask. To be honest, I just wanna stop gripping everything so tight... but I don't know how.

interviewer: It sounds like the desire to rest without relying on wine and the neighbor’s noise are key challenges right now, along with the physical and emotional toll of gripping everything so tightly. What would you like us to focus on first in addressing these challenges?

patient: I guess... the neighbor’s music? It’s like they’re drilling into my skull every night. I can’t even tell if my head’s throbbing from that or just being tired all the time. My hands still shake when I try to grip anything—shoulder knots feel like concrete. To be honest, it’s all just... piling up. The report card in my purse? I keep checking it, but it don’t make the rest of it go away.

interviewer: It sounds like the neighbor’s noise, your physical symptoms, and the pressure to hold everything together are central to how you’re feeling right now. What would you like us to focus on first as we move forward?

patient: I guess the neighbor’s noise has to come first—it’s like they’re drilling into my skull every night. My hands still shake when I try to do anything, and my shoulders feel like concrete. To be honest, I’m just tired of being tired, but what else can I do? The wine’s not even cutting it anymore.
