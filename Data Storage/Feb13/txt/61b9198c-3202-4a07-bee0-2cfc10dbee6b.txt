system: Session 61b9198c-3202-4a07-bee0-2cfc10dbee6b transcript

system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Thank you for coming in, Amanda. Can you confirm you're comfortable proceeding with this session today?

patient: Yes, I'm here, aren't I? Just... let me know if we need to pause. My coffee's keeping me upright, but I can manage.

interviewer: Great, thank you for being here. Do you have any questions about how this session will work before we begin?

patient: I guess I just want to make sure we... focus on what’s manageable. I’m used to ticking boxes, you know? Like, if we have a plan, I can follow it. But my hands—do you mind if I clasp them? The coffee’s making them shake, and I hate fidgeting. It’s just... I overthink the logistics of everything. Even this. But maybe that’s not important. Let me know if I need to slow down.

interviewer: That makes sense. Can you confirm that you understand we’ll be focusing on your current concerns and how we can work together to address them during this session?

patient: Yes, I... understand. Focus on what’s in front of us. Like the kids’ backpacks—color-coded every night. It’s a system. But sometimes the system feels like it’s... slipping. The worrying doesn’t care about the plan. It just... hums. My hands are shaking again. Probably the coffee. But if we need to talk about it, I can. The D-minus on the math test, for example. That’s a box I could tick. But the rest? The rest is static.

interviewer: That makes sense. Do you have any questions before we start?

patient: No, I think... I think we can start. Just, uh, if we could maybe check in on the... the systems approach? Like, how to keep the worrying from... from unraveling the plan. My son’s math test was a fluke, right? A problem with a solution. But the rest? The rest is just static. I’ll follow the plan. I always do. Unless the plan is... is impossible.

interviewer: Can you tell me more about the main concerns that have been affecting you lately?

patient: It’s... the usual adult stuff, right? Deadlines, the kids’ schedules, making sure they’re eating enough. I’ve been rewriting expense reports just to be sure, but my hands are still shaking from the coffee—third one today. I know it’s too much, but if I don’t color-code the backpacks, what if something slips through? Last week, my son brought home a D- and I felt... relief, honestly. At least that’s a problem I can fix. It’s just—everything else feels like static, and I’m tired of bracing for thunder.

interviewer: It sounds like creating structured routines helps you feel in control. When did you first start relying on these systems to manage your stress?

patient: It started... as long as I can remember, really. My mom had schedules for everything, and I guess I learned early that if you plan every detail, you might avoid the worst-case scenarios. But now? Now it’s like the planning is the only thing keeping me from... from what, I don’t know. The shaking? The static? My shoulders feel like they’re permanently knotted, and even when I color-code the backpacks, I’m still half-convinced I’m missing something. Bigger, probably.

interviewer: It sounds like the planning has become both a lifeline and a source of strain for you. When did you first notice things shifting to this point—where the systems feel like they’re barely keeping up anymore?

patient: It... it shifted after Dad died. The divorce was already eating at me, but losing him? It felt like the ground went out from under the whole spreadsheet. Now even the color-coding feels like I’m just... rearranging the static. I cry at 2 a.m. redoing grocery lists, wondering if the kids are getting enough iron. My hands still shake from three doubles, but it’s not helping anymore. The problem is the problem is the problem, you know?

interviewer: That sounds like a significant turning point. When did you first notice your symptoms starting to change after your father's death and the divorce?

patient: It... it started maybe three, four months after Dad passed. The divorce was already there, but his death? It felt like the spreadsheet just... collapsed. I started working longer days at the office to avoid going home, where everything was still his. My hands would shake worse, even with the coffee. I’d catch myself double-checking the locks, the fridge, stupid things. Then one night I found the eviction notice under the sink and just... froze. Like, what if the systems aren’t enough? What if I’m not enough? The kids’ backpacks still need color-coding, but half the time I can’t remember why. (Pauses, fingers tapping the armrest nervously.) It’s like the static has its own volume now. I can’t mute it.

interviewer: It sounds like the static and volume of anxiety have become overwhelming. What would you most like to work on or achieve through this therapy process?

patient: I guess... I want to figure out how to make the static quieter without losing the parts that keep me from falling apart. Like, the backpacks still need color-coding, but my hands shake so bad now I spill the markers. (Pauses, rubs neck.) If we could work on... not bracing for thunder every time the phone rings? My son’s teacher called about his grades, but I can’t fix that like I fix the lists. What if the systems aren’t enough? (Quick, hesitant glance at interviewer.) Do you think we could... build better ones?

interviewer: It sounds like this current period feels different from how you've managed stress in the past... Have you experienced periods in the past where you felt similarly overwhelmed or anxious?

patient: I’ve always had a head like a hummingbird, you know? But this… this feels like the circuits are overloading. The divorce, Dad passing—those were new variables. Before, I could at least… file the worry. Now it’s like the folders are all open at once.

interviewer: That sounds really overwhelming... Have you experienced similar periods of feeling like your usual coping strategies aren't enough in the past, and if so, what typically helped you regain control?

patient: Before, I’d... I’d just work longer hours, bury myself in spreadsheets. The garden helped, too—pruning kept my hands busy. But now, even the color-coding feels like it’s slipping. It’s not that it’s worse, exactly—it’s just... the usual adult stuff, but the margins are tighter. Like the ink’s bleeding through the paper.

interviewer: It sounds like your usual strategies are feeling less reliable now... Have you experienced other periods in your life where you felt this level of overwhelm, and if so, how did you manage those times?

patient: It’s hard to say if it’s the same... I remember after my brother’s wedding, I had to redo the seating chart seven times. That felt like a storm, but this? This is more like the dam’s cracked and I’m just... patching leaks with duct tape. The garden helped before, but now even the mint won’t stop spreading. I guess I just... work harder? But my hands are shaking so bad from the coffee, I can’t even reschedule the car repair without typo-ing the date three times.

interviewer: It sounds like you're putting in a lot of effort to manage everything, even when it's hard. Who have you leaned on for support during these stressful times, either recently or in the past?

patient: My brother... he's the only one I can really talk to, but I haven't called him in weeks. I keep thinking he'll just say, 'You're right, you're not the stable one anymore.' And the kids—well, I can't exactly offload to them. I guess I just... work? Even when my hands are shaking so bad I typo the grocery list. The garden used to help, but now the mint's spreading like it's mocking me. I'm supposed to be the one who... holds the folders together, you know?

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone... When you can't reach out to your brother, what other strategies do you use to manage the stress or reassure yourself things will stay 'under control'?

patient: I… I guess I just work? Even when my hands are shaking so bad I typo the grocery list. The garden used to help, but now the mint's spreading like it's mocking me. I'm supposed to be the one who... holds the folders together, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life?

patient: I... I haven’t gone there. It’s just—there’s so much static. The kids’ schedules, the bills, the fact that I still haven’t fixed the leak under the sink. Sometimes I think, what’s the point of even trying to keep up? But then I remember the math test, at least that’s something I can correct. My hands are shaking again, aren’t they? It’s just the coffee, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like the coffee is adding to the physical strain you're already under. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use recently?

patient: No, not really. I haven’t touched alcohol since the kids started school—too many variables. Cannabis? I don’t… it’s not my thing. Coffee’s my main vice these days. Three doubles, no sugar, just to keep the wheels turning. Though sometimes I wonder if the shaking’s the caffeine or just… everything else. The sink’s still leaking, by the way.

interviewer: It sounds like the caffeine is adding to your physical discomfort. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including over-the-counter ones, to manage symptoms like anxiety, sleep, or tremors?

patient: No prescriptions, just… some melatonin on the weekends. If I can remember to take it. The shaking? I tell myself it’s the coffee, the stress. I can’t exactly take a pill for everything, can I?

interviewer: It sounds like your sleep has been really disrupted. How many hours of sleep do you typically get in a 24-hour period, and would you say you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling unrefreshed?

patient: I... it’s inconsistent. Some nights I get five hours if I’m lucky. My mind’s always running through the to-do list—like, what if I misread an email from the school? What if the car breaks down tomorrow? I’ll lie there for hours, you know? And when I do sleep, I wake up like a clock that hasn’t been wound properly. The melatonin helps sometimes, but I forget to take it most nights. It’s just... part of the job, right? Being a parent?

interviewer: Have you noticed any periods in the last few months where you felt unusually energetic or restless, or had a lot more ideas than usual that you couldn’t slow down?

patient: I’m always... keyed up, I guess. Like my body’s stuck on ‘go’ even when there’s nothing to do. The kids’ schedules, the emails, the sink leaking—I can’t stop scanning for the next problem. My hands are shaking again. It’s just the coffee, right? And the sleep deficit. There’s no downtime when you’re parenting, is there? You just keep turning the hamster wheel.

interviewer: It sounds like your body's constant activation is really wearing on you. Have you ever experienced periods of unusually elevated or irritable mood where you felt you had more energy or needed less sleep than usual, even if it wasn't helpful?

patient: I guess if I’m being honest, there are days when I feel... more wired. Like my head’s stuck on loop, you know? But it’s not really energy—it’s more like my brain’s running a backup file it can’t save. I catch myself snapping at small things, but I just tell myself it’s the coffee or the lack of sleep. Though honestly, the sleep’s been... inconsistent. It’s easier to blame the divorce, the kids, the to-do lists than admit I might be... unraveling a little.

interviewer: It sounds like the wiredness you're describing is tied to stress but feels distinct from energizing motivation. Have there been times when this wired feeling made it so you needed less sleep than usual, even though you were still restless or overthinking?

patient: I... I don’t know if it’s ‘less sleep’ exactly. More like the hours I do get are just... static. Like last week, I lay there counting the minutes between the kids’ bedtime and when the laundry machine would start up. My brain was still running the to-do list—*did I file those reports? what if the car breaks down tomorrow?*—so even when I closed my eyes, it wasn’t really sleep. Just... pauses between the noise. And my hands? They’ve started shaking when I try to hold a cup of coffee too long. I tell myself it’s the caffeine, but...

interviewer: It sounds like the static in your sleep and the physical shaking are really wearing on you. Have you noticed any changes in your thoughts, like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or having strong beliefs that others might find unusual or paranoid?

patient: No, I don’t hear voices or see things. But sometimes I feel like... everything feels more intense. Like I’m hyper-aware of... of small things. Like when I get an email, I read it three times, wondering if I missed something. Or... or maybe I’m just... overthinking again.

interviewer: I want to make sure I understand any medical factors that might be contributing to your symptoms. Have you ever been diagnosed with a medical condition like thyroid issues, chronic pain, or sleep apnea that could be related to your tremors or fatigue?

patient: No, nothing like that. I had blood work done for the thyroid thing last year—everything was normal. The doctor just said I’m stressed. Which, I guess... but my hands still shake when I hold my coffee. Maybe it’s the caffeine?

interviewer: Amanda, from what you’ve shared, your anxiety seems tied to perfectionism and structured coping mechanisms that are now causing strain, especially after your father’s death and ongoing divorce. These stressors have intensified physical symptoms like coffee-induced tremors and sleep issues, impacting your work and parenting. Your strength lies in self-awareness and adaptive strategies, but the systems you rely on feel less effective now. What did I miss?

patient: I think... I think I’ve focused a lot on the visible stuff—the shaking hands, the sleepless nights. But there’s this... this quiet panic when I realize I’ve spaced out during a conversation, or worse, forgotten to reply to an email. My ex sends updates about the kids, and I’ll reread them a dozen times, half-convinced I missed a hint about custody. Then there’s the garden. I tell myself tending to the mint is ‘self-care,’ but it’s just another checklist item. If the plants die, what does that say about me? I don’t even know why that matters so much anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to maintain control through structured systems is seeping into areas that once felt nurturing, like the garden or communication with your ex. What did I miss?

patient: The garden... it’s supposed to be grounding, but now the mint’s wilting and I can’t tell if I overwatered or under-watered. It’s like the plants are keeping secrets. And the ex—his texts about the kids feel like they’re coded, like he’s testing if I’ll mess up the schedule. I catch myself checking my phone at dinner, waiting for 8:30 p.m. to see if the storm will hit. The systems... they’re not holding. I just... I keep thinking if I color-code the backpacks perfectly, maybe the rest will follow suit. It’s stupid, right?

interviewer: Amanda, what you’ve shared highlights how your anxiety is deeply tied to maintaining control through structured systems—like color-coding backpacks or tending the garden—even as those systems feel less reliable now. The stress of your ex’s ambiguous communication and the pressure to ‘do it all perfectly’ seem to amplify your hypervigilance, while physical symptoms like tremors and sleep disruption reflect the toll of chronic overwhelm. What did I miss?

patient: The podcasts... they let me worry about something else, but it’s still just rearranging the static. And when my son brought home that D-, I felt... a flicker of relief. At least it’s a problem I can fix. It’s stupid, but...

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot on your shoulders—can you share one small step you feel ready to take this week to help manage the overwhelm? --FUNCTION-- end_phase --FUNCTION--

patient: Maybe... I’ll try setting a timer for 20 minutes each evening to just focus on one thing—like helping my son with math. No coffee, no checking emails. If the storm hits after that, at least I know I did the part I could fix. It’s... it’s probably stupid, but it feels like a box I can check without the list eating me alive.
