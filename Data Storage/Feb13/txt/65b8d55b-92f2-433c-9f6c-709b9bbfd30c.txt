system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: It sounds like you're going through a really challenging time, Mr. Graham. Would you be comfortable proceeding with this interview today?

patient: I guess... it's been a bit rough lately. Work's been overwhelming, you know? I'm just trying to get through each day.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging. Would you be okay with us proceeding with the interview today?

patient: Yeah, I’ll… I’ll try. It’s just—work’s been a nightmare lately. I’ve been waking up at 3 a.m. and then forcing myself to focus on spreadsheets until my brain feels like mush. My wife says I’m acting like a grumpy old man, but how am I supposed to explain that I’m just… tired of being tired? (Forces a smile, rubs temples.) You know, most people can’t just *snap out of it*, right? It’s not like I’m some kind of burden or anything. (Mumbles) Adulting’s hard for everyone, I guess.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging. Would you be comfortable with me asking you some questions about your current situation and how it's been affecting you?

patient: Yeah... sure. I mean, if it helps, go ahead. Just—don’t expect too much. My brain’s been like a fog machine lately. (Pauses, rubs neck.) My daughter drew me a ‘happy dad’ picture the other day. I stuck it on my monitor, but I barely look at it. You know how it is—adulting consumes you. (Forced chuckle.) No pressure, right?

interviewer: I can see how overwhelming this must feel. Before we begin, do you have any questions about how this will work or what we'll be discussing today?

patient: No, I guess not. Just—keep it straightforward? My brain’s already working overtime trying not to fall apart. (Forced chuckle, shifts in seat.) As long as we don’t get too… *deep* too fast. I’ve got spreadsheets to haunt me later.

interviewer: Can you tell me what's been on your mind lately that brought you here today?

patient: Honestly? It's just... everything feels like a grind. Work's been non-stop—spreadsheets, deadlines, trying not to mess up. I can't even enjoy my weekend coffee anymore. My wife says I'm irritable, but I think it's just... the constant exhaustion. You know how it is when you're sleep-deprived and everything weighs a ton?

interviewer: What made you realize this was more than just a rough patch and something you needed help with?

patient: I guess... my wife kept asking me if I was okay. At first I brushed her off, said it was just work. But then I realized I hadn’t laughed in weeks—not really. Even the coffee I used to look forward to feels like a chore now. It’s not that I think I need help... it’s just... nothing’s getting better on its own.

interviewer: It sounds like work and family stressors are taking a toll. Have you experienced similar episodes of feeling this overwhelmed or down in the past?

patient: I guess... not really? I’ve always handled stress, you know? Just... this time feels different. Like the weight’s heavier. I can’t even fake my way through the coffee anymore. You try working 12-hour days and then... and then not being able to even pretend to care about the little things. It’s just... it’s not going away this time.

interviewer: It sounds like this experience feels heavier than past challenges you've managed. Have you had similar episodes in the past where stress or low mood felt this persistent and different from your usual patterns?

patient: I’ve managed stress before… I guess. My dad was always… quietly judgmental. You learn to push through, you know? But this time… it’s like the usual grind isn’t just wearing me down—it’s like I’m running on a treadmill in quicksand. The coffee? It’s still hot. Still black. But it doesn’t even taste like coffee anymore. And it’s not going away. Not like the time I pulled an all-nighter for that merger or when the kids had that double pneumonia thing.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to carry that weight alone. Have you experienced other times in your life where stress or low mood felt this persistent and different from your usual patterns?

patient: I guess... the closest was after my dad passed. But that felt different. More like... waves. This is like static. Always there. Even when I try to focus on work, it’s like my brain’s stuck in neutral. The coffee thing? That’s the first thing in years I can’t even force myself to care about. It’s not just stress—it’s like the joy’s been... drained, you know?

interviewer: That shift from waves to static is striking—how did you manage when your dad passed? Was that a time when you needed support or strategies to cope?

patient: I guess my dad's death... I just had to keep moving. You know how it is. (pauses, avoids eye contact) This time feels different. Like the ground's shifting, but I can't stop to check if I'm falling. The coffee... it used to help. Now it's just... a ritual.

interviewer: It sounds like your relationship with your dad left a lasting mark on how you handle stress. Can you share more about how his judgmental nature affected your approach to challenges back then, and how that might connect to what you're feeling now?

patient: I guess... my dad always made me feel like I had to earn my keep. If the spreadsheets didn’t cooperate, he’d just... sigh. So I learned to work through the fatigue, you know? Now it’s the same. Even when I’m crashing, I keep going. But it’s like... the harder I push, the more I feel like I’m just... broken. (pauses, rubs neck) It’s not that I wanted to become him. Just... maybe the only way I know how to breathe is by suffocating.

interviewer: It’s clear how much weight you’ve carried from your father’s expectations. How does that pattern of pushing through exhaustion to meet others’ standards affect how you cope with your current stress?

patient: It’s like... I’m on this hamster wheel, you know? Even when my head’s screaming to stop, I keep going because that’s the only way I know to... prove I’m not completely useless. (pauses, fingers tap restlessly on his knee) My wife says I’m comparing myself to my dad, but it’s not that simple. If I slow down, I’ll just... break. (voice cracks slightly, then forces a dry chuckle) Coffee used to keep me going. Now it’s just another thing I’m failing at.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly draining—like you're trapped in a cycle you can't escape. How do you think your current work and family demands are interacting with these ingrained patterns of pushing through exhaustion to meet others' expectations?

patient: I guess... it’s like trying to dig myself out of a hole with a teaspoon. Every time I think I’m making progress, the walls just cave in more. Work’s this... safety net, I guess? If I’m buried in spreadsheets, I don’t have to hear my wife’s disappointed sighs when I miss bedtime stories. But then I come home wired and snap at her, and it’s this... endless loop. (pauses, rubs neck again) Last week, I forgot my daughter’s soccer game. Again. She didn’t even ask me to come. I guess that’s better, right? Less pressure. (dry chuckle) If I’m useless at work or at home, at least I’m consistent.

interviewer: Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life?

patient: I guess... sometimes I wonder what it’d be like to just sleep through the night. You know, no alarms, no kids, no spreadsheets. But I don’t think about it like that. It’s just... mental fatigue. (rubs neck, avoids eye contact) The coffee’s still hot, at least. (dry chuckle) Still got that much going for me.

interviewer: Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or restlessness lately, or felt the need to take on more tasks than usual?

patient: I guess I’ve been... working a lot. Like, 12-hour days kind of thing. Coffee’s been my best friend, but even that’s not helping anymore. I wake up at 3 a.m. and just stare at the ceiling. My wife says I’m a grumpy robot these days. You try juggling that and a toddler, see how long you last.

interviewer: It sounds like the demands on your time and energy are really overwhelming. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life?

patient: I guess... I’ve had those 3 a.m. moments where I just think, 'What if I didn’t wake up?' But I tell myself it’s just mental fatigue. You know how it is—when you’re this drained, your brain starts playing tricks. I’d rather not dwell on it. Keeps me focused on fixing the spreadsheet errors before my manager notices again.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to carry alone. Have you had any specific plans or thoughts about how those 3 a.m. moments might turn into something more concrete for you?

patient: I—I don’t think I’ve gone that far. It’s more like... the thought lingers, but I push it away. I focus on surviving the day, you know? The coffee’s gone flat, but I keep drinking it anyway. My manager’s been... tight-lipped about my errors. I guess I figure if I just work harder, maybe I’ll stop feeling like a burden.

interviewer: It must be really draining to carry that weight alone. What do you usually rely on when those thoughts come up?

patient: I guess... coffee and work, you know? Keep the machine running. Even when it tastes like wet paper. My daughter drew that ‘happy dad’ thing—still on my monitor. I tell myself if I just... finish this report, maybe the fog will lift. But the 3 a.m. wake-ups? They don’t care how hard I try.

interviewer: It sounds like those 3 a.m. thoughts are really heavy to carry. Have you thought about how you might act on those thoughts, even in a general way?

patient: I—I don’t know. It’s not like I’ve... mapped it out. Sometimes I just stare at that drawing my daughter made and think, 'If I could just fake being okay for one more day...' But then I remember my manager’s face when I messed up the spreadsheet last week. Better to keep grinding, I guess. Even if the coffee tastes like regret now.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to keep going despite feeling stuck. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use, or other substances, that might be affecting how you're coping?

patient: I guess... I haven’t really touched anything, to be honest. Tried a glass of wine at dinner once, but it just made me feel like I was numbing the wrong thing. Felt kind of... hollow, you know? Like I was avoiding something instead of facing it. Coffee’s my only real crutch these days, even if it’s just sitting there on the counter, untouched. I hate that I need it to feel present sometimes.

interviewer: It sounds like your energy is really tied up with work. Have you noticed any times when you feel unusually restless or like you have more energy than usual, even when you're tired?

patient: I guess... there are nights I can’t sit still. Like my legs are twitching even when I’m trying to force myself to focus on the spreadsheets. It’s not like I’m hyper or anything—I just feel... jittery, like the coffee’s still in my veins even when I haven’t had any in hours. But it’s all work-related, right? You try to power through, even when your brain’s screaming to stop.

interviewer: It sounds like that restlessness is really wearing on you. Have you noticed any times when you feel like you don’t need as much sleep or have more energy than usual, even when you’re exhausted?

patient: I guess... there are nights I can’t sit still, even when I’m drained. Like my brain’s stuck on overtime mode, you know? I’ll lie awake replaying spreadsheets or that meeting I messed up. But it’s not like I’m energized—just... forced to keep going. Coffee’s not even the cause anymore. It’s like my body’s stuck in 'work until it breaks' mode. But I still crash hard the next day. Feels more like punishment than energy.

interviewer: It sounds like this restlessness is really taking a toll. Have you had any periods recently where you felt more energetic or needed less sleep than usual, even if it was just for a short time?

patient: I guess... there are nights I stay up until 3 just reworking the same spreadsheets. It’s not really energy—it’s more like my brain won’t shut off. Even when I’m drained, I feel like I have to keep going, you know? Coffee’s not even helping anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like your restlessness is really taking a toll. Have you noticed any times when you’ve felt unusually goal-driven or taken more risks lately, even if it’s just small things?

patient: I guess... not really. Just... pushing through the work, you know? Even when I'm drained, I feel like I have to keep going. It's not exactly risky, but I guess staying up until 3 a.m. reworking spreadsheets isn't exactly smart either. Feels more like being trapped in a loop.

interviewer: It sounds like that loop of exhaustion and pressure is really taking a toll. Have you ever thought about any specific way or means that those 3 a.m. thoughts might turn into something more concrete for you?

patient: I guess... I just can’t stop thinking about work. Even at 3 a.m., my brain’s stuck on spreadsheets. The coffee’s the only thing keeping me going, but it tastes like... regret. My daughter drew that ‘happy dad’ thing, but I barely look at it. It’s not like I’m planning anything. Just... tired.

interviewer: It sounds like work is really consuming your thoughts even in moments you'd like to rest. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices, seeing things others don't, or feeling unusually suspicious about something that might not be real?

patient: No, I don’t... hear things or get suspicious about nothing. Just... my head’s stuck on work. Even when I’m trying to sleep, I’m redoing spreadsheets in my head. It’s like my brain’s broken, but not in a... crazy way. Just... tired. Why? You think I’m losing it?

interviewer: It sounds like your mind is constantly working even when you'd like to rest. Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or over-the-counter drugs, including things like sleeping pills or anti-anxiety medications?

patient: No medications. Just... coffee. Black, two cups a day, same time. Helps me focus. The wine my wife drinks? Doesn’t work for me. Makes my head worse. But I guess you already knew that part.

interviewer: I want to make sure I’m not missing anything that might be contributing to your fatigue. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain that might be affecting your energy or sleep?

patient: Nope. No diagnoses like that. My doctor just says I’m ‘run down’—which, yeah, feels about right. I mean, I’ve lost some weight, but I guess that’s just... being me lately. Why? You think there’s something else they missed?

interviewer: Let me recap what I’ve heard so far: You’ve been feeling persistently down and empty for several months, with trouble sleeping, low energy, and difficulty focusing at work. This has led to irritability, strained relationships, and a sense of being trapped by responsibilities. You’ve mentioned moments of passive thoughts like wishing you could sleep through the night, but no active plans. I wonder if this captures your experience—what did I miss?

patient: I guess you got the basics... but maybe you missed how much I'm scared of being fired. My manager said I'm 'slacking'—I haven't told my wife. And the kids? I just... I don't want them to see me as their dad from the drawing. But it's not your job to fix this, right? I'm just... stuck.

interviewer: It sounds like the fear of job loss and worries about how your children perceive you are adding to your sense of being stuck. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... there’s this fear that I’m becoming my dad. The one who was always working. I don’t want to be that... cold. But I keep failing my kids. And sometimes I wonder what it’d be like to just... sleep through the noise. But that’s just tiredness, right?

interviewer: Let me try to piece this together: Your dad’s workaholism seems to have left a mark, creating a cycle where you push through exhaustion to avoid being seen as failing—especially as a parent. This tightens the grip on your stress, sleep, and relationships, even as part of you wants to break free. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... part of it is I keep thinking if I just work harder, I can outpace the mess I’m making. But my brain’s like a broken clock—just ticks without getting anywhere. The coffee’s the only thing that feels real anymore, you know? Even that’s bitter.

interviewer: It sounds like managing all these responsibilities while feeling this exhausted must be incredibly draining. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify about our next steps?

patient: I guess... I just need to figure out how to stop letting work swallow everything. Even the coffee’s starting to feel like a waste now. My daughter’s drawing... it’s on my monitor. I see it, but it’s like I’m too tired to even pretend anymore. Maybe if I could just... catch up on sleep, things would make sense. But that’s probably not how it works.

interviewer: It must be really hard to feel so disconnected from your daughter’s efforts when you’re caught up in work and exhaustion. Would it be helpful to schedule a follow-up to explore ways to balance these demands?

patient: I guess if another meeting means I can actually... I don’t know, function better? The drawing’s there, but I can’t even pretend anymore. Coffee’s the only thing that feels real. If talking helps me not drown in spreadsheets, sure. But don’t expect miracles.

interviewer: It seems the drawing is a small but meaningful connection for you—I’ll make sure to check in on how that feels for you in our next session. Before we wrap up, would you like to share anything else about what’s on your mind, or is there a specific goal you’d like to focus on moving forward?

patient: I guess... the only thing I want is to stop feeling like I’m one missed deadline away from disappearing. The coffee’s gone cold again, just like everything else. If we could figure out how to... I don’t know, not sink every night? That’d be something. But don’t bother checking on the drawing. It’s just paper, right?
