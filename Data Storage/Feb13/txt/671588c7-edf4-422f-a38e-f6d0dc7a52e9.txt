system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Hi David, thank you for coming in today. To start, would you prefer to be called David, or do you have a different name or pronoun preference I should know about?

patient: Please call me David. To be honest, I prefer keeping things straightforward—no need for complications. Efficiency helps me conserve mental bandwidth.

interviewer: That makes sense—being direct can help us make the most of our time. Do you feel comfortable proceeding with this session today?

patient: I suppose so. I’ve already committed the time, so... might as well proceed. Though I should mention I do tend to overthink these things—hope that doesn’t make me inefficient.

interviewer: It’s okay to take the time you need—efficiency can still be maintained without rushing. Do you have any questions about how this session will work or what we might focus on today?

patient: I suppose I’d like to know if this is a space to discuss... practical strategies for managing work-related stress. Lately, I’ve been overanalyzing a project at work—what if I misread an email? It’s consuming bandwidth I don’t have. Though I should probably stop chewing gum first; my jaw’s been tighter than a spreadsheet formula.

interviewer: It makes sense to focus on practical strategies to support your work and well-being. Would you be comfortable moving forward with discussing these today?

patient: I'll be honest—I'm more comfortable focusing on solutions than... than unpacking the problem. As long as we can keep it grounded, I'm willing to try. Though I should probably mention my sleep lately... not insomnia exactly, but I wake up with numbers in my head. Mortgage rates. Tax projections. You know how it is when deadlines loom.

interviewer: It sounds like the constant worry and restlessness have been really overwhelming for you. Can you tell me more about when these feelings started and what might have triggered them?

patient: To be honest, it’s hard to say exactly when it started. I’ve always been... efficient with my worries, I guess? My father used to say anxiety was just extra diligence. But recently, there was this email mix-up with a colleague that’s been gnawing at me. I misread a tone, overcompensated, and now I can’t stop second-guessing every message I send. It’s like my mental bandwidth is maxed out trying to predict all the ways things could go wrong. I suppose that’s just... how it works now.

interviewer: That email situation sounds like it's created a real loop of second-guessing. Can you share how this has specifically affected your work interactions since it happened?

patient: It’s made delegation... difficult. I keep double-checking every detail now, which probably makes me seem micromanaging. My colleague hasn’t brought it up, but I assume they find it frustrating. I tell myself it’s ‘risk mitigation,’ but honestly? It feels like my jaw’s always clenched. Even my rock-climbing routes lately are too ‘safe’—no real challenges. I guess that’s just... efficiency with a hobby.

interviewer: It sounds like this shift in your work style is taking a toll on both your professional and personal activities. When did you first notice this pattern of double-checking and hesitation with delegation starting?

patient: It’s... hard to pinpoint a start date. The email incident accelerated things, but I’ve always had a 'safety margin' in decision-making. My father would call it prudence. Now it feels like that margin keeps expanding. I catch myself checking project timelines three times before sending—an hour wasted, but 'risk-averse.' To be honest, I blame the workload. We’re understaffed this quarter. My jaw’s been... worse since March, but I tell myself it’s just caffeine withdrawal.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the combination of work demands and these persistent worries. What are your hopes or goals for how we can work together to address this?

patient: I guess... I want to recalibrate. Not eliminate the worry, but maybe... streamline it. Like, if I could trust delegation again without it feeling like a 'risk exposure,' that would free up mental bandwidth. And if my jaw would stop aching by 8 PM, that’d help. But honestly? I’m not sure where to start. Is this about... restructuring thought patterns? Or do we just... troubleshoot the obvious stuff first?

interviewer: It sounds like you're looking for practical ways to manage these worries without losing your efficiency. What strategies have you found most helpful or unhelpful in managing these worries and physical symptoms so far?

patient: To be honest, the only thing that helps is rock climbing—it’s a physical puzzle that short-circuits the mental noise. Chewing gum helps the jaw, but it’s... temporary. Delegation? Unhelpful. I tried trusting that email exchange would resolve itself, and it backfired. Now I’m stuck choosing between micromanaging and regret. Coffee used to steady me, but lately it just makes my chest hurt. I suppose practical steps matter more than... hope.

interviewer: It sounds like work stress has been a major trigger for your anxiety—have you experienced episodes like this in the past, where similar pressures led to physical symptoms or mental overwhelm?

patient: To be honest, it’s a pattern I’ve noticed but never... fully unpacked. Last year, during a project launch, my jaw started aching nonstop—I chalked it up to ‘bad posture’ even though I wasn’t at my desk. Shoulders felt like concrete, and I’d wake up at 3 a.m. calculating ROI projections. The difference now is the email incident made me question if I’m just... overcompensating again. My body’s always had a louder volume on stress than my mind does.

interviewer: It’s telling that your body’s physical signals feel more trustworthy than your mind’s rationalizations. Can you say more about how the email incident unfolded and how it made you feel in the moment?

patient: It’s... tricky to isolate one moment. The email itself was a neutral request, but I fixated on the subject line—'Follow-up' felt like a silent judgment. My jaw locked up immediately, and I spent the next 48 hours re-reading every prior exchange for hidden cues. The irony is, I pride myself on 'efficiency,' yet this consumed my bandwidth. I still second-guess if the problem was the misread tone or my own... hypervigilance. To be honest, it’s exhausting explaining this—it feels like admitting a flaw in my operating system.

interviewer: It sounds like work has been a major source of stress—have you found it helpful to talk through these pressures with anyone, whether at work or outside of it?

patient: To be honest, I’ve avoided discussing it much—my team assumes stress is just part of the job. I suppose I frame it as ‘optimizing communication’ rather than... admitting misreads. My rock climbing buddy notices my jaw clenching, but you can’t exactly troubleshoot ‘background processing’ over a boulder problem. I keep waiting for someone to hand me a flowchart for this, but it’s just... persistent. Like a spreadsheet that auto-fills worries even when you close the file.

interviewer: It’s challenging when work environments don’t acknowledge stress physically—how does your climbing buddy support you when they notice your jaw clenching or tension?

patient: They’ll mention it—‘Dave, your face is a locked vault again’—but you can’t exactly debug mental noise mid-climb. Last week, he flat-out said, ‘Your efficiency hack is breaking.’ I laughed it off, but… it’s awkward. Like admitting your backup battery’s dying during a power outage. We just keep climbing. It’s… efficient, I guess, to have someone notice without asking questions.

interviewer: It’s interesting how your climbing buddy provides subtle support without pressuring you—have you found that similar low-key strategies helped during past stressful periods at work?

patient: I suppose the closest was... micromanaging tasks to create a buffer zone. If I controlled every detail, there were fewer 'gaps' for things to go wrong. A former colleague once joked I was building a firewall around my projects—but you can’t exactly ask for help when your mind’s already drafting contingency plans. It usually backfires, honestly. The more I 'optimize,' the more I... hyperventilate in slow motion. Like a spreadsheet that auto-fills worries even when you close the file.

interviewer: It sounds like this pattern of overcompensating has been a long-standing challenge—have you experienced similar episodes in the past where work stress led to these kinds of physical and mental reactions, and if so, what approaches helped at the time?

patient: To be honest, it’s a... recursive problem. Every project feels like a nested algorithm where I have to optimize for every possible error code. Last quarter, a deadline collision caused my jaw to lock up worse than usual—my dentist called it ‘bruxism,’ but I think it was just my body flagging a system overload. The only ‘fix’ was forcing myself to outsource a task, which... well, the email incident was the 5th iteration of that failure mode. I suppose rock climbing helps, but it’s not a patch for the underlying code.

interviewer: I want to check in about your safety. Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or taking your own life?

patient: I... I haven’t gone there. My mind’s more of a stuck engine than a shutdown. The worst is when I lie awake calculating mortgage rates until 3 AM, but even that feels like a system overload, not a failure mode. Rock climbing helps—there’s no 'undo' button in mid-air, so I can’t second-guess the hold. My jaw’s still a stress meter, though. My dentist would call it 'bruxism,' but I think it’s just my body flagging a system needing... maintenance.

interviewer: It sounds like rock climbing gives you a helpful mental reset. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns lately that feel different from your usual stress cycles?

patient: Energy... it’s inconsistent. Climbing gives a temporary buffer, like rebooting a system, but the baseline is still... frayed. Sleep? I wake up more now, not from noise but... numbers. Last week, I fell asleep mid-climb planning my mother’s care. My jaw still locks up, though. The dentist would call it ‘bruxism,’ but I think it’s just my body flagging a system needing... maintenance.

interviewer: I hear how the physical tension and mental cycles are wearing on you. Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or over-the-counter remedies for these symptoms—like for jaw pain, sleep, or anxiety?

patient: To be honest, I’ve avoided meds—my jaw’s a ‘maintenance issue’ I manage with gum. The dentist mentioned a night guard, but... it’s another task on the queue. I suppose chamomile tea helps, but it’s more of a... temporary buffer. The real challenge is rerouting the system before it hits overload.

interviewer: I note how caffeine seems to play a role in your physical symptoms. Have you used alcohol, cannabis, or other substances (like stimulants or prescription medications) in the past year, or noticed any changes in use recently?

patient: Alcohol? Maybe a glass of wine at family dinners—socially acceptable, not a variable in the equation. Cannabis? Hardly relevant. Caffeine’s the only ‘input’ I track. My dentist would say my jaw’s a separate case, but... I prefer to call it maintenance. The gum’s cheaper than a night guard, after all.

interviewer: It sounds like your sleep patterns are quite disrupted. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or need very little sleep, even when stressed?

patient: I don’t think so. When I’m stressed, my mind just races—I’ll lie awake calculating numbers or mortgage rates. There was a time I stayed up late working on a project, but that’s more about deadlines than energy. I’ve been trying to ‘optimize’ my rest, but my jaw’s been tight. The climbing helps, but it’s more about physical exertion than energy surges.

interviewer: It seems your energy fluctuations are closely tied to work demands. Have you noticed any periods where your energy levels felt unusually high or you needed significantly less sleep, even when not tied to deadlines or projects?

patient: I don’t think so. When I’m stressed, my mind just races—I’ll lie awake calculating numbers. The climbing helps, but it’s more about physical exertion than energy surges. I’ve been trying to ‘optimize’ rest, but my jaw’s been tight. It’s more about... tension, not energy.

interviewer: I hear how your body and mind are constantly under pressure. Have you ever experienced a period where you felt unusually energetic or needed significantly less sleep, even when you weren’t working on a project or under deadlines?

patient: No, not really. When I’m not working, I... my mind still runs maintenance checks, I suppose. There was a stretch where I cut back on sleep to 'streamline' my mornings, but that’s self-imposed. The energy’s always tied to deadlines or... contingencies. Climbing burns calories, not anxiety—it’s just physical math. I guess I’m the world’s most efficient worrier.

interviewer: David, from what we've discussed, it sounds like your chronic anxiety is primarily work-related, leading to persistent worry, physical symptoms like jaw tension and sleep disruption, and impacting your work performance and personal life. This pattern seems to be maintained by perfectionistic tendencies and overcompensation through micromanagement, while your problem-solving approach and rock climbing help you cope. What did I miss here?

patient: You mentioned problem-solving and climbing, but there's a lingering 'something feeling off' at work—a misread email that's haunted me. Also, family obligations... my mother's health. I fear helping her will tip the scales. It's... low-bandwidth stuff I haven't unpacked yet.

interviewer: David, it sounds like the misread email has added a layer of second-guessing at work, and your mother’s health is creating additional pressure you’re worried might overwhelm you. Is there anything else I’ve missed about how these issues are showing up in your life right now?

patient: It’s... the jaw thing. It’s not just the clenching anymore. I catch myself grinding at night, which means my shoulders are probably a mess. And the emails—every response feels like a security protocol I can’t bypass. I’ve started drafting replies in my head during climbs, which ruins the ‘mental reset.’ It’s... efficient? No. Just another loop. And my mother... I keep calculating care home costs in my spare bandwidth. It’s not that I don’t care. It’s that caring feels like a system update I’m not ready for.

interviewer: David, you’ve described how work stress and caregiving responsibilities are creating overlapping loops of hypervigilance—like grinding your jaw at night and mentally drafting emails during climbs—while your mother’s needs feel like an impending system update you’re not ready for. Is there anything else I’ve missed about how these patterns are showing up in your life?

patient: To be honest, I’ve been avoiding family calls about my mother’s care. It feels like opening another tab on a browser already crashing. And... the gum—chewing helps, keeps the jaw from... turning into a stress battery. But maybe that’s just... deflection.

interviewer: David, I appreciate your honesty. The family calls about your mother’s care and the gum as a temporary coping mechanism add important context to how you’re managing stress. What else feels important to include about how these challenges are shaping your experience right now?

patient: I suppose the email mix-up keeps replaying in my head. It’s not just work—it’s like my mind can’t compartmentalize. Even climbing, I catch myself drafting replies in my head. It’s... inefficient, but I don’t know how to stop. And sleep? I rest, but wake up tired. Like a recharge cycle that’s broken. Maybe I’m just... overloading the system.

interviewer: David, to recap: Your anxiety feels like a system overload, with work stress and caregiving responsibilities creating loops of hypervigilance—like mentally drafting emails during climbs or calculating care costs at night. Sleep feels broken, and physical symptoms like jaw grinding amplify the sense of being stuck in overdrive. What did I miss or misframe here?

patient: You captured the overload well. Maybe just... how my body turns meetings into marathons. I’ll sit there, jaw clenched, fingers tapping—a drumbeat of ‘what-ifs.’ And the email incident? It’s not just work. My sister wants me to co-manage Mom’s care, but even discussing it feels like priming a pump for a flood. I keep thinking, *What if I miscalculate?* It’s... inefficient, but I don’t know how to stop auditing my own limits.

interviewer: David, I want to make sure I’ve captured how the physical strain of meetings, the email incident, and your mother’s care responsibilities are all interwoven in this sense of system overload. What would be most helpful for us to focus on next? For example, exploring strategies to manage the physical symptoms, discussing potential support for your mother’s care, or considering options for professional support?

patient: I think... the physical stuff first. The jaw pain isn’t just a metaphor—it’s a constant reminder I’m stuck in ‘analyze’ mode. And maybe the email incident? It’s not just work; it’s like my brain can’t unplug even when I’m trying to problem-solve. But let’s not start with Mom yet. I’ll... need more bandwidth for that.

interviewer: David, to clarify my understanding: Your physical symptoms—like jaw grinding and sleep disruption—feel like a body language version of being stuck in 'analyze mode,' while the email incident keeps triggering a loop of second-guessing that even invade your climbing and rest. You’re prioritizing addressing these physical and cognitive patterns first, before diving into caregiving stressors. Is there anything I’ve misrepresented or overlooked here?

patient: You’re close, but maybe missing how the jaw pain isn’t just physical—it’s a feedback loop. I’ll chew gum to quiet it, but then the gum becomes another thing to ‘optimize’ (low-calorie, sugar-free…). And the email incident? It’s not just replaying it; now I second-guess every *tone* in messages, even to my climbing partner. It’s like my brain’s running antivirus scans on everything. But yeah, let’s focus on the body first. The ‘system’ feels… fragile right now.

interviewer: David, it seems your anxiety is creating a cycle where physical symptoms like jaw tension and sleep issues reinforce cognitive loops—like over-optimizing gum choices or mentally drafting emails during climbs—while caregiving pressures loom as an unresolved stressor. Does this align with your experience, or is there another angle I should consider as we plan next steps?

patient: It’s… not inaccurate, but I’d frame it as my body’s ‘error messages’ getting prioritized lower than work deadlines. The jaw thing? It’s like my molars are running a silent audit on every word I don’t say. And sleep… I’ve started counting mortgage amortization tables instead of sheep. They’re both math, right? As for Mom—let’s just say delegating care feels like outsourcing a critical system update. I’d rather chew through another gum pack than… unpack that yet.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying a lot of pressure while trying to keep things running smoothly. Let's recap: We discussed starting with cognitive-behavioral strategies to manage the worry cycles and physical tension. Would you like to add anything else before we wrap up today?

patient: I think… the gum’s working as a temporary patch, but I’m still drafting replies in my head during climbs. Maybe the bigger issue is that I keep waiting for a ‘system update’ notice before I can… address the deeper stuff. But let’s stick to the plan. If the CBT strategies buy me more bandwidth, I’ll know where to start.

interviewer: It sounds like you're using the CBT strategies to create some mental space—could you share if there's anything else you'd like to address before we wrap up today?

patient: The gum’s holding for now—though my molars are still doing tax audits on every pause between chews. I’ll… circle back on the ‘deeper stuff’ once the system scan finishes. For today, I think the plan’s sufficient. Efficiency’s a virtue, after all. Right?
