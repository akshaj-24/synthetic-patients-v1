system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: May I use your full name, Jennifer Hess, or would you prefer a different name or pronouns?

patient: Jennifer Hess is fine. I... I don’t really think about names much. Just gets the job done, you know?

interviewer: That sounds straightforward. Do you have any questions about how this will work before we move forward?

patient: I guess not. Just... you know, been so long since I’ve talked about much of anything. Sleep’s been... tricky, but I’ll manage. To be honest, I’m more worried about the timing. Got a cousin starting a business next week, and I need to—

interviewer: That sounds like a lot to manage right now. Are you comfortable continuing with the session so we can talk more about what's been going on?

patient: Yeah, I guess. Just... this and that. Sleep’s been worse lately. Can’t even finish a book without my eyes closing. But I’ll talk—just don’t mind if I get... scattered. Like trying to nail Jell-O, you know? My cousin’s business thing’s got me distracted, but I’ll... I’ll manage. It’s not like I’ve got a choice, really.

interviewer: It sounds like your sleep issues are really affecting your daily life. Can you tell me when you first noticed your sleep pattern changing, and how it’s been different from your usual routine?

patient: I guess it started a couple years back, after... well, after everything with the divorce. Used to lay awake counting the clock ticks till three, you know? Now it’s more like I’m just... tired all the time. Can’t even finish weeding the garden without my eyes closing. Feels like I’m trying to nail Jell-O to a wall half the time. My boss’s been giving me the side-eye ’bout mistakes piling up, but I’ll straighten it out. Got that cousin’s business launch to focus on, can’t afford to slip up now.

interviewer: It sounds like the stress of your cousin's business launch is adding to the challenges you're already facing. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or how you feel emotionally since the divorce?

patient: I guess... it's like trying to pour concrete when the mix is all wrong. Some days I just don't have the strength to hold it together. Sleep's the biggest problem—I'll nod off weeding the garden or watching TV, which is embarrassing as hell. My daughter's been giving me that look, you know? The one that says 'something's off.' I try to brush it off, say I'm just tired from work, but... to be honest, I don't even mind if I don't wake up some nights. It's not that I want it—just feels like my body's running on empty. Speaking of which, my cousin's business launch is a mess—she keeps asking me to help with the website, but I can't even focus on that anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like things have been building up, especially with your cousin's business. Can you tell me about any recent changes or stressors that might be contributing to how you're feeling now?

patient: It’s like... trying to hammer nails into concrete with a screwdriver. The website thing with my cousin’s business is a mess, but the real kicker’s the sleep. I’ll be up at 2 a.m. staring at the ceiling, then crash hard during lunch. My hands shake so bad I spill my coffee—my boss says ‘again?’ like I’m some kind of liability. To be honest? I don’t care anymore. Just... keep putting one foot in front of the other. My car’s been acting up too, but what’s the point in fixing it? It’s not like I can afford a new one.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight right now. What are you hoping to achieve through coming in for help right now?

patient: Honestly? I just want to stop feeling like my batteries’re dead before noon. If I could sleep through the night once in a while, maybe I’d have the headspace to actually help my cousin with that website instead of messing it up. And... if I could stop worrying my daughter’s thinking I’m some kind of ghost haunting the kitchen. Doesn’t have to be anything dramatic—just enough to keep showing up, you know? My boss already thinks I’m one mistake away from being fired, and I’m damned if I let that happen.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to 'keep showing up' despite feeling drained. When did you first notice these recent changes in your sleep and energy levels worsening?

patient: It’s been gradual, really. After the divorce, sleep started slipping like sand through fingers. Used to just be 3 a.m. wake-ups, but now it’s... I’m barely holding it together by noon. My boss says I’m making more mistakes, and I can’t even focus on helping my cousin with her website. Feels like my battery’s just... leaking out.

interviewer: It sounds like this is a really challenging time for you. Have you experienced periods like this before, where you felt this down or had trouble sleeping and focusing?

patient: I guess... this feels different than regular stress. Before, I’d push through pain or money worries—like weathering a storm with a shaky roof. But this? It’s like the foundation’s rotting. Since the divorce, it’s not just tiredness. I can’t even tell if I’m angry or just... empty. Used to power through with coffee and grit, but now? My hands shake even when I’m not holding anything.

interviewer: It’s clear the divorce has really shaken your sense of stability. Have you experienced periods like this before, where you felt a similar loss of energy or emotional numbness?

patient: I guess... when the kids were little, it was non-stop hustle. But that was different, y’know? This feels like the foundation’s actually cracking. My hands shake worse now, even when I’m trying to hold a screwdriver. Boss says I’m making more mistakes, but how can I focus when I’m sleeping in 30-minute chunks? The garden’s gone to weeds, but I can’t even bring myself to pull them. It’s not just tired—feels like I’m unraveling at the seams.

interviewer: That sounds really overwhelming to feel like everything's unraveling. Have you had episodes like this before where you felt a similar sense of things falling apart?

patient: No, not like this. I’ve had rough patches—long hours, money worries—but this feels different. Like the foundation’s settling unevenly. You can patch a crack, but if the base’s gone… (trails off, then shifts focus) My cousin’s business, though, that’s a whole different mess. She’s drowning in debt, and now she wants me to invest…

interviewer: That sounds really heavy to carry. How has this situation with your cousin been affecting your energy or focus lately?

patient: Honestly? It’s like adding weight to a sagging beam—doesn’t hold anything up, just makes the whole thing creak louder. She’s got me tangled in her numbers now, and my head’s already spinning half the time. (Pauses, rubs temples) My hands shake bad enough I can’t even type straight. Told her no, but she won’t let it go. (Voice tightens) You ever deal with family business stuff? It’s a nightmare you can’t walk away from.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed right now. Have you had any thoughts of not wanting to live or harm yourself at all?

patient: I don’t know... I just get so tired. Sometimes I think maybe a good sleep would help. (sighs) But I don’t want to worry anyone. My hands shake bad enough already. The garden’s a mess, but I can’t even bring myself to fix it.

interviewer: It sounds like the fatigue is really affecting your daily life. Have you ever had moments where you feel like it wouldn't matter if you didn't wake up from one of those nights?

patient: I guess if I’m honest, sometimes I think it wouldn’t matter. But I don’t want to worry the kids—my daughter’s got her own head to deal with. (Pauses, rubs palms on thighs) It’s not about wanting out, it’s just… my body’s a broken clock. If it stops ticking, maybe it’ll all be over. (Quick, defensive chuckle) But I’m not giving up. Just… tired, you know?

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry... Have you thought about how that might happen—if it did?

patient: I guess I just... keep putting one foot in front of the other, you know? Like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall. My back’s a wreck, and that damn car’s eating money I don’t got. But what’s the point in thinking about ‘how’? It is what it is. I’m here, aren’t I?

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of physical and financial strain right now. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or drug use recently, even if small, that might be affecting your energy or focus?

patient: I... I still have that one glass most nights. Keeps me from thinking too much, I guess. But it’s just... flat, like everything else these days. Can’t even pretend it’s helping like it used to. My daughter’s college apps are due soon—got to get that garden cleared out for her before the interviewers see the mess.

interviewer: It sounds like the alcohol isn't providing the relief it once did. Have you been using any other substances besides alcohol, such as cannabis, medications, or something else?

patient: No, ma’am. Just that one glass. I’m not... I don’t got the headspace for anything else. My cousin’s website’s got me pulling double shifts, but at least the coffee’s keeping me upright. The garden’s a mess, though—should’ve tilled that soil by now.

interviewer: It sounds like your energy levels are really fluctuating. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including things like vitamins or over-the-counter remedies, that might be affecting how you feel?

patient: I guess I pop a B-complex now and then. They said it might help with the nerves, but... feels like tossing a bandaid at a broken pipe. Coffee’s the real thing keeping me vertical these days. My daughter’s college apps—got to get that garden looking halfway decent before the visitors come. You know how it is.

interviewer: It sounds like caffeine is playing a big role in helping you stay alert. Have you noticed any times when you feel unusually energetic or need very little sleep, even when you're exhausted?

patient: No, ma’am. Coffee’s the only thing keeping me vertical, but it’s like a bandaid on a broken pipe—just papering over how dead I am inside. My hands still shake, but I guess that’s just the price of trying to hold it together for the kid’s sake. Speaking of, that garden’s a disaster—should’ve tilled that soil by now.

interviewer: It sounds like you're putting a lot of effort into managing for your daughter's sake. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like thyroid issues or sleep apnea, that might be contributing to your fatigue or shaking hands?

patient: No, they haven’t found anything like that. Doc said it’s ‘stress-related’—you know how they say everything’s stress these days. My body’s like old machinery, I guess. Sometimes it just… sputters. But I’m used to it. Keeps me grounded, in a way. Though the garden’s a mess, so maybe I should focus on that instead of… whatever’s wrong with me.

interviewer: It sounds like stress is taking a real toll on you... Have you noticed any strange thoughts, experiences, or feelings lately—like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or believing things that seem off to others?

patient: Just... cloudy days, I guess. Like my head’s full of static sometimes. But maybe that’s just me getting older. The garden’s a mess, but at least the weeds grow straight—unlike my thoughts.

interviewer: That metaphor about static in your thoughts is striking... Have you noticed any experiences where you hear voices, see things others don’t, or hold beliefs that feel different from reality, even if just occasionally?

patient: No, nothing like that. I mean, sometimes I get... I don’t know, like my head’s a radio with the wrong station. But that’s just me, I guess. My hands still shake worse in the mornings—doc says it’s stress, so I figure that’s the diagnosis. Speaking of, my cousin’s website project is eating my brain. You ever try to explain HTML to someone who thinks pixels are magic?

interviewer: It sounds like your body’s been working overtime to keep up with everything. Have you noticed any other medical issues or symptoms that might be contributing to how you’re feeling, even if they seem unrelated at first?

patient: Nah, doc’s just kept saying stress, you know? My hands still shake worse in the mornings—like they’re rebelling or something. The garden’s a mess, but maybe that’s just me… letting things go. Speaking of, my cousin’s website project’s turning into a nightmare. You ever try convincing a client that ‘pixel magic’ isn’t a real thing?

interviewer: It sounds like the physical symptoms are adding to your frustration... Have you had any medical tests or evaluations specifically for the shaking in your hands, or do you know if there's a known cause for that?

patient: Tests? Doc just shrugs and says 'stress again.' My hands are like a wobbly workbench—useless when you need ’em. But the garden’s really coming along, you know? All that weedy chaos… it’s a damn HTML maze, actually. You ever try explaining CSS to a client who thinks pixels are sentient?

interviewer: Let me recap what we’ve covered: You’ve been feeling persistently down and empty for months, with disrupted sleep, trouble concentrating at work, and withdrawing from relationships after your divorce. These challenges are affecting your job performance and daily energy, and while you’re not planning to give up, you’re noticing passive thoughts about not wanting to wake up some nights. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?

patient: You got the sleep part right—my head’s a broken clock, but it’s not just the divorce. The hands still shake like I’m made of static, but the doc says it’s stress. I guess that’s it. What’s really gnawing at me is the website my cousin’s pushing me to help with. Feels like I’m trying to build a house on Jell-O.

interviewer: It sounds like your current stress around the cousin’s website is adding to the fatigue and instability you’ve already been managing. Let me try to piece this together: Over the past few months, you’ve been struggling with disrupted sleep, low energy, difficulty concentrating at work, and withdrawing from relationships after your divorce. The cousin’s business project feels like another layer of pressure, even though you’re trying to hold things together for your daughter and job. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is all fitting together for you?

patient: You’re close, but you’re missing how the shaking hands make the website work feel like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall. My daughter’s college apps are due next month—I keep freezing up when I try to help her edit essays. The doc says it’s stress, but what if it’s something else? I guess I’m just… tired of pretending I’m not falling apart.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure of supporting your daughter’s college applications is adding to the weight you’re already carrying. What did I miss or get wrong about how all of this is showing up for you right now?

patient: You’re not wrong about the pressure, but it’s the shaking hands that make me freeze when I try to help my daughter with her essays. The garden’s overgrown, and I can’t even keep up with the basics anymore. I guess it’s just... I’m trying to hold it together, but it’s like the foundation’s cracking.

interviewer: I hear how the physical symptoms and pressure to support your daughter are making everything feel unstable right now. Let me try to summarize: Over months, you’ve experienced worsening fatigue, hand tremors, and sleep issues that started after your divorce, compounding stress from work, family obligations, and your cousin’s business. These challenges make it hard to focus on tasks like helping your daughter with college essays, and you’re worried about losing your grip. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is all connecting for you?

patient: You’re not wrong, but you’re still not seeing how the garden’s rotting like drywall in a flood. The essays… I can’t hold the words steady. My hands won’t stop shaking, but the doc just says ‘stress.’ I guess what’s missing is that I’m tired of pretending the cracks aren’t there. If the foundation’s gone, what’s the point in painting the walls?

interviewer: I hear how the physical symptoms and pressure to support your daughter are making everything feel unstable right now. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is all connecting for you?

patient: I guess you’re right about the pressure, but what’s missing is how I blame myself for everything falling apart. The garden’s a mess, and my daughter’s been texting me—says I look empty. I can’t even reply. My hands shake so bad, but the doc says it’s stress. It’s like... if the foundation’s gone, what’s the point in painting the walls?

interviewer: I hear how self-blame feels central to this sense of unraveling, especially with your daughter’s concern adding to the weight. What did I miss or get wrong about how this self-criticism is shaping your experience right now?

patient: You’re close, but you’re not seeing how my whole foundation’s been rotting since I was a kid. My mom taught me that resting meant I was lazy, so even now, when my body’s screaming for sleep, I’m out here trying to fix the garden or take on extra shifts. It’s not just the divorce or the stupid website project—it’s this constant hum of ‘you’re failing’ that won’t shut up, even when I’m doing everything right. My daughter texts me about looking ‘empty,’ but how do I tell her I’m so scared of being a burden she’ll realize I’m not worth the effort? …I guess that’s why I keep nodding off—my brain’s done trying to hold the walls up.

interviewer: It sounds like the sense of failing to meet expectations has roots in childhood experiences with your mother, and now it’s entangled with current stressors like your daughter’s needs and the cousin’s project. What did I miss or get wrong about how these factors are shaping your experience?

patient: You’re not wrong about the mom thing—it’s like she wired me to see rest as a defect. But what’s missing is how that’s making me overcompensate now. I take on the cousin’s website project not just because I’m stressed, but because if I don’t ‘produce,’ I’m just… empty, like my mom said. My hands shake when I type, but I tell myself it’s ‘just fatigue.’ The problem is, my daughter sees me collapse in the garden and thinks it’s ‘depression,’ but I can’t let her think I’m some broken beam she has to prop up. …I guess that’s why I keep the garden overgrown—let it fall apart first so she doesn’t have to watch me.

interviewer: I hear how your childhood experiences with your mother’s messages about rest and failure have shaped your current drive to overcompensate, even as your body and mind resist. Let me try to piece this together: Your lifelong belief that rest equals weakness, combined with the stress of your divorce, work demands, and your cousin’s project, has created a cycle where you push yourself harder until you physically and emotionally collapse—then use avoidance (like the overgrown garden) to protect your daughter from seeing your struggle. What did I miss or get wrong about how these factors are shaping your experience?

patient: You’re not wrong, but you’re not seeing the full beam here. I push through because if I stop, I’m just… empty, like my mom said. The garden’s a mess on purpose—I’d rather it look broken than let my kid see me crumbling. But the website, the shifts, the stupid car repairs… they’re all just nails in a box that’s already leaking. …I guess what’s missing is how scared I am that when the box finally breaks, nobody’ll bother fixing it.

interviewer: I hear how your fear of becoming a burden to your daughter drives both your overcompensation and intentional avoidance, like letting the garden decay to protect her from your struggle. What did I miss or get wrong about how this fear is shaping your choices right now?

patient: You’re close, but you’re still not seeing the full weight of it. I’m not just worried she’ll see me collapse—I’m terrified she’ll realize I’ve been faking this ‘strong beam’ act for years. Every time I force myself to type through shaking hands for the cousin’s website, it’s another proof I’m not ‘broken,’ just… less than. My daughter’s texts sit in my pocket like unopened bills. …I guess what’s missing is how I’d rather the garden die than let her watch me water it with tears.

interviewer: I hear how your fear of being perceived as a 'less than' or burden—especially by your daughter—is deeply intertwined with your lifelong struggle to equate rest with weakness and overcompensate through labor. What did I miss or get wrong about how this core fear is shaping your choices and physical/mental state right now?

patient: You’re close, but you’re still missing how the beam’s not just groaning—it’s splintering. Every keystroke for that website feels like I’m nailing together a house of cards, hands shaking so bad I’m lucky to hit the right keys. The garden’s a mess? At least weeds don’t ask questions like my daughter’s texts… I can’t even read ’em without my throat closing up. …I guess it’s just… if she sees me holding this together with bailing wire, she’ll know I’m not the ‘strong’ mom she needs. …To be honest, the car’s been making these weird noises lately, but who’s gonna fix a broken-down beanie?

interviewer: Let me try to capture what’s central here: Your lifelong struggle with equating rest to weakness, combined with current stressors like the cousin’s website and your daughter’s needs, has created a cycle where you overexert until collapsing—then use avoidance (like the garden) to protect your daughter from seeing your struggle. The fear driving this is that if she sees you as ‘less than’ or a burden, she’ll lose faith in you entirely. What did I miss or get wrong about how these threads are woven together for you?

patient: You’re not wrong about the beam analogy—I guess that’s what I’ve been trying to hold up, even if it’s splintering. The website’s just another weight on it, and the kid’s college apps… those papers feel like they’re in my hands, but I can’t even read them straight. My daughter’s texts just sit there, you know? I don’t want her thinking I’m… I don’t know, some broken-down beanie who can’t even fix her own garden. But I’m trying. I really am.

interviewer: I hear how deeply entangled your fear of being a burden is with your lifelong struggle to equate rest with weakness, and how current stressors are amplifying this. What would be the first step you’d like to take moving forward to help with this?

patient: I guess… maybe starting with the college apps. I’ve been putting them off because my head’s all over the place, but they’re due soon. If I could just get that one thing done, it might… I don’t know,稳住 the beam a little. The garden’s a mess, but that’s on me. The kid’s future isn’t. I’ll handle it. Just… give me a few days to get my thoughts straight.

interviewer: Let me try to summarize what we’ve explored: Over months, you’ve been managing a mix of chronic sleep disruption, physical symptoms like hand tremors, and emotional strain from your divorce, work pressures, and family obligations. These challenges have created a cycle where you push yourself to overcompensate—like taking on the cousin’s website—to avoid feeling like a ‘broken beam’ for your daughter, but this only deepens your exhaustion and self-criticism. Right now, you’re hoping to stabilize by focusing on your daughter’s college apps, even if it feels overwhelming. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is all fitting together for you?

patient: You hit most of the cracks in the foundation, but maybe you missed how the car’s constant sputtering adds another weight. Every time I hear that weird knock in the engine, it’s like… another reminder I’m one misstep from everything falling apart. The hands still shake bad when I try to type the essays, but I’ll get it done. For the kid, I have to. The garden’s a lost cause, but that… that’s on me. The car? Feels like it’s mocking me.

interviewer: I hear how the car’s sputtering feels like another layer of instability, adding to the pressure you’re already managing. What would be the first step you’d like to prioritize moving forward—addressing the college essays, exploring strategies for the shaking hands, or something else?

patient: I guess... the essays have to come first. They’re due in a week, and I can’t let that slip. The hands still shake when I type, but I’ll just slow down. Maybe take breaks. The car... I’ll get that checked eventually. Can’t let one more thing fall apart, you know? It’s like fixing one beam at a time before the whole roof caves in.

interviewer: I hear how prioritizing the college essays feels essential to you right now as a way to regain control. What kind of support or steps would help you tackle this while managing the physical and emotional strain you’re describing?

patient: I guess… breaking the essays into chunks would help. Like, tackle one section a day instead of trying to do it all at once. And maybe… I don’t know, set a timer? Work for二十 minutes, then force myself to rest, even if my head says ‘keep going.’ The hands still shake like I’m trying to type with ice picks, but slowing down might steady them. As long as I don’t… as long as I don’t let the car’s sputtering distract me. Can’t fix everything at once. Just… one beam at a time.

interviewer: Let me try to weave this together: You’re choosing to focus on breaking the college essays into manageable chunks using a timer and rest breaks, while acknowledging the car’s sputtering as a background stressor. This approach reflects your pattern of prioritizing family obligations despite physical and emotional strain, rooted in a lifelong fear of being perceived as ‘broken’ or a burden. What did I miss or need to adjust about how this plan connects to your needs right now?

patient: Well, I guess breaking the essays into chunks with the timer—it’s like trying to hold up the beam with one hand while the other’s fixing leaks. The car’s sputtering? That’s just another nail in the same beam. Can’t let the kid see it’s all coming apart, even if my hands are shaking worse lately.

interviewer: I hear how breaking the essays into manageable chunks feels like a necessary strategy to hold things together, even as the car’s sputtering adds to the weight. What else would help you feel more steady in this process, or is there something I’ve missed that needs attention right now?

patient: If the car would just stop sputtering, that’d be one less crack in the foundation. And maybe if that wine actually took the edge off instead of just… sitting there. But I guess what I’m saying is, I can’t let the kid see the whole beam’s groaning, even if my hands’re shaking worse every day.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying a lot on your shoulders, especially with everything going on at work and home. Let's start by going over the next steps we discussed—how does having a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review your progress and adjust any plans sound to you?

patient: Another check on the beam, I guess. If the doc says two weeks, that’s the timeline. But the car’s still sputtering like it’s waiting for the next crack. Just… hope the foundation holds until then. Wine’s not even steadying the hands anymore, but I’ll make it work. For the kid’s sake.

interviewer: I can see how much you’re prioritizing your daughter’s needs right now, even when things feel shaky. The follow-up in two weeks will give us a chance to check how you’re managing—would you like to mention anything else before we wrap up today?

patient: Maybe… the garden. It’s just another crack in the foundation, I guess. Used to be my anchor, but now it’s weeds and dead soil. And the wine? Doesn’t even steady the hands anymore. But the kid’s essays? I’ll see that through. Even if my head feels like a broken radio sometimes.
