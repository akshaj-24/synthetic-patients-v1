system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Hi, my name is Daniel Hanson. Just to start, is there a name or pronouns you'd prefer me to use when we talk today?

patient: My name’s William... William Evans. I guess. And, uh, he/him pronouns, I think. Just go with that. I’m on a break from work, if that matters. The warehouse keeps me busy, but... it’s just work, y’know?

interviewer: Thanks for sharing that. I can see work can feel routine sometimes. Would you be comfortable discussing your current concerns today?

patient: I guess... I’ve been feeling stuck, y’know? Work’s been okay, but I’m just... tired all the time. Like, even after sleeping, I feel like I’m moving through thick water. And stuff at home—bills, little things—just pile up. I don’t know. Maybe it’s nothing. I don’t want to make a big deal out of it.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging. Just to clarify, today’s session will involve discussing your current concerns to help understand what’s going on. Does that sound okay with you?

patient: Yeah, I guess. It’s just... everything feels so heavy lately. Bills, work... I don’t know. Maybe it’s nothing, but I’ve been so tired, you know? Like my head’s full of static, and I can’t even think straight half the time.

interviewer: Is there anything you'd like to ask before we begin?

patient: No, I guess not... You’ll guide me, right? I just... hope this isn’t a waste of your time. I don’t even know if there’s a point to any of this.

interviewer: Can you tell me what’s been going on for you lately that brought you here today?

patient: Lately? It’s just... everything feels like a grind. I’ve been waking up early, like 3 a.m., and can’t fall back asleep. At work, I keep messing up inventory counts, and my boss gave me a warning. I don’t know, maybe I’m just tired? But even when I do sleep, my head feels... foggy, like trying to think through thick water. Amber says I’ve been snapping at her over stupid stuff, and I feel awful about it afterward. I guess I just don’t want to add to everyone’s problems, you know?

interviewer: That sounds really tough, especially dealing with the stress at work and feeling like you're letting people down. When did you first start having trouble sleeping at night?

patient: I think it started maybe... eight months ago? Around when everything with my mom and work got heavy. I’ve just been telling myself it’s stress, you know? But lately, it’s been worse. I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep. Feels like my brain’s stuck on overdrive or something.

interviewer: It sounds like things have been building up over time. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or how you feel about things during this period?

patient: I guess... I’ve been feeling more down than usual, but I just tell myself it’s stress. I don’t really care about things anymore, you know? Even stuff I used to like, like feeding Max or watching old shows, feels like a chore. I get... irritable, I guess. But I don’t mean to take it out on Amber. I just feel stuck, like there’s this weight I can’t shake.

interviewer: It sounds like this weight has been growing heavier over time. When did you first start noticing these feelings of being down and losing interest in things like feeding Max or watching shows?

patient: I think it started maybe around the same time my mom’s health got worse... eight months or so? At first, I just thought I was stressed, you know? But then... even stuff like feeding Max or watching my old shows felt like I was going through the motions. Like, I’d sit down to watch an episode, but my head felt so foggy I couldn’t even follow the plot. I just... don’t get that spark anymore. It’s like my brain’s stuck in neutral.

interviewer: That numbness and mental fog must be incredibly draining, especially when trying to hold everything together at work and home. What are you most hoping might change for you through coming to this session?

patient: I guess... I just want to stop feeling so weighed down. Like, if I could actually sleep through the night without waking up at 3 a.m., that’d help. And maybe not take out my frustration on Amber so much. I don’t want to keep hurting the things that matter. But I don’t even know if that’s realistic. It’s like... I used to like the way the sweet tea tastes when she hands it to me. Maybe I want to feel that again? Like something small actually matters.

interviewer: It sounds like the thought of losing your job or relationship is part of what’s bringing you here now. Have there been any specific recent events or changes that made things feel more urgent for you to seek help?

patient: I guess... it’s been the little things piling up. The rent notice, messing up at work, snapping at Amber for no reason. I kept thinking if I just fix one thing, maybe it’ll all steady out. But it’s like... every time I grab hold of something, it’s slipping through my fingers. So maybe getting some help before it all falls apart entirely.

interviewer: It’s understandable that these small stressors can add up and feel overwhelming. What have you been doing to manage these stressors or try to cope with how you’ve been feeling?

patient: I... I guess I just try to power through, you know? Nap in my car between shifts if I can, drink that sweet tea Amber makes to... to steady myself. But it’s like the fatigue’s rooted or something. I tell myself if I just focus on the basics—pay the bills, don’t screw up at work—everything else will work out. But then I mess up anyway, and I worry I’m dragging her down. It’s hard to explain, but... it feels like I’m one mistake away from losing it all.

interviewer: Have you experienced similar periods of feeling this way in the past, where you felt stuck, overwhelmed, or lost interest in things you usually enjoy?

patient: I guess... not really? I mean, there was that time after my mom’s health started slipping. I was just really stressed then, I guess. But this feels... different. Heavier. Before, I could just tell myself to push through, you know? Now it’s like the weight’s stuck in my chest, and even pushing through feels like I’m just digging myself deeper. I don’t know if that makes sense.

interviewer: It makes sense that this feels different. When you were caring for your mom before, did that period feel similar in terms of how you were emotionally and physically affected, or was it a different kind of struggle?

patient: I think... it was more just stress back then. Like, I was tired and worried, but I could still... push through. Now it’s like there’s this rust building up, you know? Even when I try to push, it’s like everything’s just... heavier. And the fog doesn’t clear, even after a good night’s sleep. I guess I’m scared I’m not just ‘stressed’ anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like this weight you're describing is really different from what you've managed before. Can you tell me about any activities, people, or things that have helped you feel even a little bit better or provided some relief, even if just small moments?

patient: I guess... when Amber makes me that sweet tea, it’s one of the few things I actually look forward to. Just for a minute, it feels like... normal, you know? But even that’s slipping through my fingers sometimes. The dog used to mean more, but now even walking Max feels like I’m dragging my feet through mud. I don’t know. It’s hard to explain.

interviewer: That sounds like a small but meaningful connection you're holding onto. How would you describe your relationship with Amber these days?

patient: It’s… it’s okay, I guess. We’ve been good most of the time, but lately, I feel like I’m just dragging her down. I snap at her over little things, and then I feel awful afterward. To be honest, I worry she’s tired of me already. I try to make up for it by handling more around the house, but even that feels like too much some days. She’s been nothing but patient, though. I don’t know what I’d do without her, but I hate that I can’t just… be better for her.

interviewer: It sounds like Amber's support means a lot to you, even with these struggles. Are there specific ways she helps you feel more connected or supported, even on harder days?

patient: It’s… she brings me the tea, you know? The sweet tea I used to love. I’ll just sit with it for a minute, try to focus on the taste. But most days, even that feels like a chore. She’ll ask me to help with stuff around the house, but I just… freeze, like my brain can’t catch up. I tell myself it’s better to just do the little things right, but half the time I mess them up anyway. I hate that she has to keep… reaching for me.

interviewer: Have you had any thoughts about ending your life?

patient: I… I don’t want to talk about that. It’s not something I’d ever consider. But I guess… some days feel so heavy, you know? Like I’m just… stuck in this fog. But I try not to think like that. It’s easier to focus on things like the rent or work, even if I can’t keep up.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing that. Have you been using alcohol or cannabis to cope with these heavy days, or any other substances like stimulants or medications?

patient: I… I don’t think so. Not really. I mean, maybe a beer once in a while, but that’s about it. Don’t want to… add more things to screw up. Work’s already on edge, and I can’t afford another problem.

interviewer: It sounds like you're trying to avoid adding more stress to your life right now. Have you been using any medications, either prescribed or over-the-counter, or other substances besides alcohol to help with your symptoms or daily functioning?

patient: No, I’m not on any medications. I try to avoid them, just… don’t want to risk anything else with work already being so much.

interviewer: It sounds like work responsibilities are adding a lot of pressure right now. Have you noticed any times when you feel unusually restless or unable to slow down, even when you're tired, or when you need less sleep than usual?

patient: I guess... it’s more like I can’t seem to get enough sleep. I wake up around 3 a.m. and just stare at the ceiling. My mind’s racing, even when I’m exhausted. It’s like... static, you know? Feels like work stress, but it’s always there, even when I’m trying to rest. I don’t know if that counts as ‘restless,’ though.

interviewer: It sounds like your sleeplessness is really adding to the weight you're feeling. Have you ever had periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed less sleep, even when it led to you taking risks or pushing yourself in ways that felt out of character?

patient: No, I don’t think so. I mean... the opposite, really. Most days I feel like I’m moving through thick water. If anything, I push myself too hard to keep up, like at work. I double-check everything now, just to avoid messing up. But that’s it—no energy surges. Just... static. And guilt, I guess. Like I should be able to shake this.

interviewer: Let me recap: You’ve been feeling stuck in a heavy fog for months, with trouble sleeping, low energy, and losing interest in things you used to enjoy. The stress from work, financial worries, and caring for your mom has made it harder to cope, but your partner Amber has been a key support. What did I miss?

patient: I think you got the main stuff. Maybe... the guilt. I feel like I’m letting everyone down, even Amber. And the tea she brings me—it used to ground me, but now even that feels like one more thing I can’t hold onto. It’s all slipping, you know? Rent, work, her patience... and I don’t know how to stop it.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight of guilt and the fear of losing what little stability you have—especially with Amber—feels overwhelming right now. If I were to summarize, we’ve talked about persistent low mood, trouble sleeping, exhaustion, difficulty focusing at work, and a sense that responsibilities and relationships are slipping through your fingers. What did I miss?

patient: Yeah... you covered most of it. I guess the thing that’s hardest to explain is how I don’t even miss the parts of myself that used to care. Like, Max used to love walks, and I’d think about how happy he looked... but now even that feels like a memory I can’t reach. And the tea Amber brings me—it’s not that it’s bad, it’s just… another thing I’m afraid I’ll drop. Like, if I mess this up, there’s nothing left. But I don’t know. Maybe that’s just me being dramatic.
