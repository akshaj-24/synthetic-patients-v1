system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Mr. Patterson, it's good to meet you. To start, would you like to share your preferred name or pronouns if they're different from what's on your intake form?

patient: Call me Joshua. He/him, I guess. Paperwork’s always formal, but yeah, that’s the standard stuff. I’m just a fussbudget when it comes to... well, anything really. Heh. You’ll hear about the plumbing before you hear about my problems, probably.

interviewer: It’s good to hear you’re comfortable with that. Today, we’ll be discussing your concerns and how we can work together. Before we begin, do you have any questions about the process?

patient: Not really, no. I figure if it’s like a job site—got a plan, stick to the blueprints, right?—then I’ll just follow along. You’ll let me know if I’m... y’know, off track?

interviewer: That sounds like a good approach. Just to confirm, are you comfortable with proceeding with our discussion today?

patient: Sure, I’m comfortable. Just... hope I don’t take too long. I tend to overthink the steps, you know? Like double-checking every bolt before tightening. Doesn’t sound crazy, does it?

interviewer: It's common to want to be thorough—let's take the time you need. Before we start, is there anything else you'd like to clarify about today's process?

patient: No, I think we’re good to go. I just... I triple-check every wire I install, you know? Doesn’t sound neurotic, does it?

interviewer: It sounds like the constant worrying and physical symptoms are taking a real toll on your daily life. What would you like to achieve through this treatment?

patient: Honestly? I just want to stop being such a worry stone for everyone. If I could... I don’t know, not triple-check every wire in my sleep, that’d help. Maria’s tired of my ‘social whiskey’ routine, and I’d like to actually fix the furnace before it breaks, you know? Small stuff. Just... stop letting the little things eat up all my headspace.

interviewer: It sounds like the need to check things repeatedly is really consuming your energy. When did you first start noticing this pattern of checking behaviors?

patient: Probably after that client complaint last year. I guess that’s when it really kicked in—like, what if I messed up bigger than a leaky valve? My son’s phone bill thing was a minor thing, right? But... what if it’s a pattern? My dad always said a loose connection starts fires. Maybe I just inherited the paranoia with a screwdriver.

interviewer: It sounds like the client complaint last year really intensified your worries. Have you experienced similar periods of intense anxiety or checking behaviors in the past, and if so, what helped or didn’t help at the time?

patient: Smaller stuff, maybe? Like, my dad always made me redo bad joints until they clicked right. But this... this is different. I guess I just drank more whiskey back then, hoping it’d quiet the loops. Doesn’t work, though. Maria says talking helps, but I’m scared to unpack it all. What if I can’t fix it? You know?

interviewer: It makes sense that unpacking these things feels scary when the loops feel so persistent. What specific aspects of opening up do you find most concerning right now?

patient: I guess... the fear that if I actually lay it all out, people’ll see how... how incapable I really am. Like my dad used to say, a loose connection starts fires. What if I’m just a loose wire waiting to spark? And Maria—she’s used to the whiskey and the garden, but what if she realizes I’m just... one more thing breaking down? It’s not like I can fix it with a wrench, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like your dad’s influence has shaped how you view mistakes and control. Have you experienced any traumatic events in your life that you think might be related to your current worries?

patient: Trauma? I guess... my dad’s always made me redo bad work. But that’s just how you learn, right? Though lately, the phone bill thing and my mom’s health... it’s like all the wires in my head are crossed. I just don’t want to be the guy who lets everything spark. But is that even relevant? You know how these family stuffs are—fussbudget stuff.

interviewer: It sounds like your dad’s standards have left a lasting mark on how you see your own work and worth. How has that approach to precision and mistakes shaped how you handle challenges at work or in your relationship with Maria these days?

patient: My dad always said a loose connection starts fires, so I guess I triple-check every wire now. At work, it’s... it’s safe, right? Better slow than sorry. But Maria? She’s used to me worrying about the boiler breaking or something. I don’t want her thinking I’m just... a loose wire myself. I mean, she’s patient, but what if I’m neglecting something bigger? This doesn’t sound like a crazy way to think, does it?

interviewer: It sounds like Maria’s patience is both a comfort and a source of pressure for you. How has she supported you during times when your worries feel overwhelming, and are there moments when that support feels harder to accept?

patient: Maria... she’ll sit with me sometimes. We cook, or watch those old horror movies I like. It’s nice, really. But when she tries to talk it out—ask if I need help—I just... freeze up. Like, what if I admit I can’t even fix my own head? I end up changing the subject to work stuff. You know, 'Did I check the boiler today?' It’s safer. She says I’m a worry stone, but I don’t want her seeing how... shaky I really am. Does that make sense?

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to appear 'together' can feel heavier when someone you care about is involved. Have you experienced similar patterns of avoiding conversations about your struggles in the past, and if so, how did that tend to play out?

patient: I guess... I used to do the same thing at work. If a job was tricky, I’d get so deep into the manual or call the supplier a dozen times just to be sure. Once, a co-worker caught me redialing the same number for an hour. I just said, 'Better a slow job than a wrong one,' and laughed it off. But inside, I was thinking, 'If I don’t figure this out alone, they’ll see how clueless I really am.' I mean, it’s not like I was breaking anything, right? You know how it is—sometimes the fix is just... taking forever to fix yourself.

interviewer: It sounds like handling problems alone has been a way to manage feelings of not being capable. How might those past experiences of dealing with things yourself be connected to the worries you’re facing now?

patient: It’s like... when I was younger, if a job felt shaky, I’d bury myself in manuals or call suppliers until I felt sure. Now, it’s the same with Maria. I keep thinking, 'If I just check the boiler one more time, or track my mom’s doctor notes forever, maybe I won’t look like a failure.' But it’s exhausting. Last week, I spent two hours re-reading repair instructions for a job I’d done a hundred times. My hands were still shaking from it. I guess I’m scared if I ask for help, someone’ll see I’m not as... solid as I pretend. Does that make sense?

interviewer: It sounds like the effort to maintain control is taking a toll on you physically and emotionally. Have you found any strategies in the past that helped you manage these feelings of needing to check or fix things, even if just a little?

patient: The garden helps, I guess. Digging in the dirt feels... solid. And fixing things, you know? The click of a wrench fitting right—it’s like a mini-victory. But whiskey? That’s just my way of numbing the buzz. Doesn’t really work, but it’s all I’ve got. I guess what I’m trying to say is... sometimes the small wins matter, even if they’re just... well, small.

interviewer: I hear how the whiskey feels like a temporary fix but leaves you stuck in those worry loops. How often are you using alcohol, and have you noticed any changes in your use recently?

patient: It’s... social mostly, you know? One or two drinks at work functions, maybe a beer on the porch with Maria. But lately, it’s like the whiskey just... doesn’t sit right. My hands still shake, and I’m pacing the house afterward, checking the furnace again. Guess I’m just getting more... keyed up? Irony’s not lost on me—using alcohol to calm down but ending up like a live wire. Haven’t mentioned it to Maria. She’d say I’m overthinking. Again.

interviewer: I hear how the whiskey feels like a temporary fix but leaves you stuck in those worry loops. How often are you using alcohol, and have you noticed any changes in your use recently?

patient: It’s... not like I’m drinking more, just that the effect’s changed, you know? Used to relax me, now it’s like pouring gas on a spark. Last week, I had a single scotch, then spent two hours checking the furnace pressure gauge. Again. Maria just laughs and says I’m 'being thorough,' but... (shrugs) Maybe I’m overthinking. Again.

interviewer: It sounds like alcohol is no longer providing the relief you used to get, which can be really frustrating. Have you been using any other substances, like cannabis, stimulants, or opioids, either to manage your worries or for other reasons?

patient: No, nothing else. I mean, I’ve thought about... maybe a sleeping pill now and then, but Maria’s always on me about that. 'You’ll be hooked before you know it,' she says. And I guess she’s right. I don’t want to be one of those guys who needs a bottle to function. The whiskey’s bad enough. (pauses, fidgets with his hands) Though... sometimes I smell weed on the guys at work. Doesn’t appeal to me. Feels like another thing to worry about. Another variable.

interviewer: Have you had any thoughts about ending your life in the past year?

patient: No, never really gone there. I mean, life’s a mess sometimes, but I’ve got responsibilities—Maria, the work, the garden. Can’t just... let the whole system short out on her, you know? She’s got enough to deal with. (small, self-conscious chuckle) Though sometimes I do wonder if I’m just... delaying the inevitable. But that’s just the whiskey talking, I guess.

interviewer: I hear how you’re balancing a lot of responsibilities to keep things stable. Have you been taking any medications or supplements, like sleeping pills or anti-anxiety medications, to help manage your worries or sleep?

patient: No meds, doc. I mean, the doctor mentioned something once—maybe a beta blocker?—but I didn’t want to start that. Maria’s always saying, 'You’ll just get used to it and need more.' (shrugs) I guess I’m just... waiting? Or maybe I’m overthinking. Again. Sleep’s been... fragile, you know? The furnace checks keep me up, but it’s the thinking that’s the problem. The whiskey used to help, but now it’s like... (hesitates) Well, you’ve heard of a human worry stone? I’m that. Just... solidified.

interviewer: I hear how the whiskey feels like a temporary fix but leaves you stuck in those worry loops. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or have a lot of ideas, even when you’re not sleeping well?

patient: Energy? I guess not really. More like... tired but wired, you know? Like a flickering bulb—uses up power but doesn’t throw off much light. I’ll sit at the workbench for hours, hands shaking over a screwdriver, thinking about how the threads should catch. Doesn’t make me feel sharp, just... frayed. Does that make sense?

interviewer: That sounds really frayed and exhausting. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns or energy levels recently—like sleeping less than usual or feeling restless even after rest?

patient: It’s... tricky to pin down, but I’ll lie awake sometimes, my mind jumping from the furnace thermostat to Maria’s grocery list. The whiskey used to help me drift, but now it just makes my hands shake more—like they’re trying to tighten a loose thread that’s not even there. I guess ‘restless’ is the word. Even when I do sleep, I wake up feeling like I’ve been rewired overnight. Does that count as rest?

interviewer: I hear how restlessness is affecting your sleep and focus. Have you had any periods where you felt unusually energetic or had a lot of ideas, even when you weren’t sleeping well?

patient: Not really energy, more like... my mind’s a loose wire. Even when I’m too tired to move, it’s still sparking ideas, but they don’t stick. Like trying to follow a schematic with a short in the circuit—just... flickers. My dad used to say a loose wire starts fires. I guess that’s me at night, worrying the furnace’ll short out if I don’t figure it out. But it’s all static, really. No real charge behind it. Does that answer make sense, or am I just rambling?

interviewer: I hear how your mind feels like a 'loose wire' even when exhausted. Have you noticed any times when you’ve taken on more tasks or projects than usual, or felt unusually driven to fix things, even with little sleep?

patient: No, not really taking on more... more like I can’t let go of the ones I’ve got. Like tightening a bolt—keep going, just to be sure. Even if my hands are shaking, I’ll check those wires three times. It’s not drive, it’s... fear of a loose thread. My dad always said a bad connection starts fires. I guess I’m just... being careful. Does that make me a worry stone or a responsible guy?

interviewer: I hear how the fear of a 'loose thread' feels deeply personal and tied to your values. Have you ever been diagnosed with a medical condition—like thyroid issues, chronic pain, or sleep apnea—that might be contributing to or worsening these symptoms?

patient: No medical diagnoses, as far as I know. I’ve got my dad’s wiring—literally. If something’s off, I check it. Check it again. Maybe that’s the problem. And the whiskey... well, it’s a social lubricant, not a prescription. Though sometimes I wonder if it’s just another loose connection. You know how it is with circuits—adding more wires can hide the real short. I guess I’m just... a worry stone with a hammer.

interviewer: Joshua, from our conversation, it sounds like you've been dealing with chronic anxiety and compulsive checking behaviors that started around a year ago, possibly triggered by a client complaint and influenced by family patterns of perfectionism. These behaviors are affecting your work performance, causing physical symptoms like shaking hands, and straining your relationship with Maria, who's been trying to support you but feels your stress. You mentioned using whiskey as a coping mechanism, which used to help but now seems to make things worse. What did I miss?

patient: I guess you didn’t mention how my mom’s health is adding to it... it’s like a leaky pipe I can’t quite fix. She’s got that COPD thing, and I keep thinking about how to handle it but... don’t want to burden anyone. The garden’s been helping, though—digging in the dirt grounds me, literally. Just... haven’t told Maria about the mom stuff yet. Scared she’ll see how incapable I am.

interviewer: It sounds like your mother’s health is adding a layer of stress you’re trying to manage on your own, while the garden offers a rare sense of control. You’re also holding back from sharing this with Maria because you fear she’ll see you as flawed. Let me recap what we’ve covered so far: chronic anxiety, compulsive checking behaviors, alcohol use as a partial coping strategy, strained relationship dynamics, and now this added stressor with your mom. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... maybe how tired I am? Like, even after gardening, my hands still shake sometimes. It’s like... the wire’s live even when I think it’s off. And the whiskey? It just makes me jittery, you know? Can’t even relax without checking the furnace again. It’s a loop.

interviewer: It sounds like your fatigue and the physical toll of anxiety are becoming harder to ignore, even with activities like gardening that usually help. Let me recap what we’ve covered so far: chronic anxiety and checking behaviors linked to perfectionism, alcohol use that now worsens symptoms, strained relationship dynamics with Maria, and added stress from your mother’s health. You’ve also described a cycle where restlessness and intrusive thoughts keep you stuck in a loop of checking. What did I miss, or is there anything you’d like to clarify?

patient: I guess... the worst part is how it never really turns off. Like a stuck engine idling nonstop. Even when I'm digging in the garden, my head's still checking every joint, every bolt. The whiskey just... revs the engine louder. I'm tired of being tired, you know?

interviewer: That sounds really exhausting—like carrying a live wire in your hands all day. Let me try to pull this together: We’ve talked about your relentless checking, the whiskey’s paradoxical role, your mom’s health as a stressor, and how even grounding activities like gardening don’t fully quiet the mental noise. What did I miss, or is there anything you’d like to adjust before we think about next steps?

patient: I guess the thing is... it’s the same stuck engine, but now there’s this extra weight with my mom. I keep thinking I should tell Maria, but what if she sees me as... as a loose wire that can’t hold? The garden’s the only thing that feels solid, but even then, my hands still shake. It’s like I’m fixing everything but myself.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to maintain control, even when it's exhausting. How would you like to approach next steps—any specific goals you'd want to prioritize moving forward?

patient: I guess... I want to learn to turn off the switch sometimes. Not just keep tightening every bolt till they’re stripped. Maybe talk to Maria about my mom—before I short-circuit completely. But how do you fix a live wire without getting shocked? I’m tired of the sparks.

interviewer: It sounds like reaching out to Maria about your mom is a priority for you right now—would you like to discuss how we might support that conversation or any other steps moving forward?

patient: I... I guess talking to Maria about Mom makes sense. But what if it’s another loose connection? You know, something that seems stable but... frays under pressure? I’ve been avoiding it because I don’t want her to see how much I’m struggling. It’s like trying to fix a circuit without shutting off the power—dangerous, but I keep thinking I can handle it. The garden helps, though. The dirt, the routine... it’s the only thing that feels solid lately. But maybe... maybe we could start with that? The garden metaphor? It’s less... intimidating than talking about wires and sparks.

interviewer: It’s reassuring to hear the garden offers you some stability—it sounds like a grounding anchor we can build on. Would you like to outline one small step you’ll take this week to continue that metaphor, or is there anything else you’d like to clarify before we wrap up?

patient: I’ll try planting some new tomato starts this week—something simple, with a clear schedule. Water every morning, check the soil... concrete tasks. It’s weird, but if I can keep them from withering, maybe it’ll... steady me. I’ll let the garden be the anchor, not me. Does that... make sense, or am I stretching the metaphor too thin?

interviewer: It’s reassuring to hear you’re grounding yourself in this plan—would you like to add anything else to your next steps or is there another focus you’d like to address before we wrap up?

patient: Maybe... I’ll try checking the soil pH before planting. Seems simple, but if I get that right, the rest might fall into place. Work’s been asking me to lead a repair crew next week—should be straightforward, but I’ll probably triple-check the blueprints anyway. It’s the same loop, I know. My hands still shake when I read them... but maybe that’s just fatigue? Doesn’t feel like much, but it’s a start. Would that... count as progress?

interviewer: It sounds like setting small, measurable goals in the garden and at work could help you regain a sense of control without overextending—would you like to discuss any adjustments to these plans or confirm they feel manageable as next steps?

patient: The pH test... I’ll do it first thing Monday. Fingers crossed the soil’s not too alkaline. It’s the small fixes that keep the system running, right? The crew at work—straightforward, but I’ll probably redraw the blueprint annotations three times. My hands still tremble when I hold a pencil... feels like a power surge in my nerves. The whiskey might help me sleep through it, but I’ll ration it. One drink, not a fuse I can’t unplug. Does that... cover the essentials without overcomplicating?

interviewer: It’s encouraging to see you’re taking these structured steps to ground yourself—would you like to note any specific support or resources you’d like to build into your plan as we move forward?

patient: Maybe... a written checklist for the garden tasks? Something I can cross off without second-guessing. And if I run into trouble with the blueprints, I’ll... ask the crew lead to review them once. Doesn’t feel like much, but it might keep the current flowing. Oh—Maria said something about a gardening book with pH charts. Maybe borrowing that would help? I’ll... mention it to her tonight. Does that... make sense as a support?

interviewer: It sounds like your checklist and gardening plan give you a clear, steady path forward—would you like to add anything else to solidify these next steps before we wrap up?

patient: I guess... maybe just adding one more thing to the list. My garden—it’s the one thing that feels solid, you know? When I’m out there, the dirt under my nails keeps me from... from spiraling too much. But I still catch myself double-checking the rows at night, like if I space them wrong, everything’ll fall apart. It’s silly, right? It’s just plants. But... it helps. For now.

interviewer: It’s clear your garden and structured plans are meaningful tools for you—would you like to confirm these next steps feel manageable, or is there anything else you’d like to address before we close today?

patient: The garden’s... it’s the closest thing I’ve got to a solid wall these days. But yeah, the rows still bug me at night—what if I miscalculated the spacing? What if the soil’s not holding? I guess I’m just used to... overcompensating, you know? It’s a habit. Maybe I’ll try locking in the plan for now. Doesn’t hurt to leave some room for adjusting, though. This all sound okay, or should I be worried about biting off more than I can chew?
