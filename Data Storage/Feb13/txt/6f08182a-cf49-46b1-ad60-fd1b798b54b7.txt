system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Janet, is it okay if we proceed with this interview today?

patient: Sure, I guess. Just trying to stay awake, though. Coffee’s been my friend lately.

interviewer: It sounds like staying awake has been a challenge lately. Do you have any questions about how this interview will work before we start?

patient: No, I think it’s straightforward. Just… however you need me to talk. I’ll try to stay awake, but coffee’s been my only real alarm clock these days. To be honest, I’m used to working through tiredness. It’s the same with any job—just keep going, right?

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying a lot lately. Can you tell me when you first noticed these feelings starting?

patient: Six months ago, maybe? After that job site mix-up with the wiring. I told my boss it was my fault—my hands aren’t what they used to be, you know? I’ve been arriving early to avoid rush hour, double-checking everything... but it’s just part of getting older, I guess. To be honest, I’d rather talk about the coffee machine in your office—it looks like it could use a descale.

interviewer: It sounds like that job mix-up might have been a turning point for you. Can you share more about how you felt in that moment, and whether the part about 'getting older' feels like a concern you’ve been avoiding?

patient: It was just one of those things, you know? My dad always said precision was everything. When I messed up that wiring, it felt like... like a screw that won’t seat right. Keeps you up wondering if it’s just age or if you’re slipping. But I’ve always been a fixer. Let me check—does your coffee machine have that same descaling light? Mine’s been blinking nonstop lately.

interviewer: It sounds like the wiring mistake really shook your confidence. Can you share how that moment connected to the changes you've noticed in your energy or focus since then?

patient: I don’t know... The mistake itself was just a screw-up, really. I’d been up most of the night before, staring at the ceiling, trying to figure out why my hands kept shaking when I tried to wire the box. It’s not like I’m getting younger, right? You start second-guessing everything. But honestly, it’s probably just the coffee machine acting up again. I’ve been drinking enough to power a city.

interviewer: It sounds like those sleepless nights have been adding up for you. Can you tell me when this trouble with staying asleep first started happening regularly?

patient: To be honest, I can’t pin down the exact start date. Maybe six months ago? Around the time of that job site mix-up. I’ve always been a light sleeper, you know? But now it’s like my brain won’t let me rest, even when my body’s screaming for it. I’ve been drinking coffee all day just to function. It’s not ideal, but… it works, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like the combination of sleep trouble and caffeine use has become a real strain. Can you share an example of how these challenges have affected your interactions with your husband lately?

patient: It’s… put a strain, I guess. He keeps saying I’m moving slower than usual, which I hate because it feels like another criticism. To be honest, there were nights I just couldn’t get out of bed, and he’d find me there, still in my pajamas. I’d make excuses about the coffee machine needing repair or work stress, though. I don’t want him thinking I’m… falling apart.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging, especially wanting to protect your marriage while feeling so overwhelmed. What would you most like to achieve through coming in for help?

patient: I guess... I just want to feel like I can keep up without dragging everyone down. You know, do my job without messing up, and not have my husband see how... tired I really am. Probably sounds selfish, but I don’t want to be a burden.

interviewer: It’s understandable to want to protect your marriage while managing so much. Have you tried any strategies so far to manage these challenges, and how have they worked for you?

patient: I’ve tried going to bed earlier, but my head just won’t shut off. Coffee’s my main strategy—been drinking it nonstop since the job mix-up. Helps me get through the day, I guess, but it’s not really fixing anything. My husband keeps suggesting I slow down, but I figure if I power through, I can at least hold things together. It’s not ideal, but...

interviewer: It sounds like this has been a really challenging time for you... Have you experienced episodes like this before, where you felt this down or hopeless?

patient: Episodes? I guess... not exactly. I’ve had rough patches before, like when the shop moved locations and I had to rewire the whole break room. That was a nightmare. But this feels different. More like a motor that’s worn out instead of a loose wire. I just keep chugging on coffee, you know? It’s the only thing that keeps the gears turning. My husband says I’m ‘slowing down,’ but I tell him I’m just... recalibrating.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re describing a shift from past challenges to something more persistent now. Have you experienced times in the past where you felt similarly down or hopeless, and if so, what helped you through those periods?

patient: I’ve had my share of rough patches—like that break room rewiring mess. Power through, drink a gallon of coffee, and pretend the shaking in my hands isn’t part of the job anymore. But this? This feels like the motor’s finally given up. Last time, I just... recalibrated. This time, I’m not sure there’s a fix.

interviewer: It sounds like the strain is taking a real toll on your usual ways of coping… How has your husband been supporting you through this, and are there moments when that support feels harder to accept?

patient: He doesn’t give up on faulty wiring, I guess. Keeps asking if I need more sleep, but I just say I’m ‘recalibrating’ again. The truth? His worried looks make me grit my teeth—like when a screw won’t seat right. Sometimes… when I let the coffee go cold, he’ll hold my hand. It’s a good fix, but I still feel like a half-assembled appliance. Not quite working, but not broken enough to scrap yet.

interviewer: It sounds like accepting your husband's support can feel complicated at times... Can you share more about what specific aspects of his support feel hardest to accept right now?

patient: It’s not that he’s not trying... It’s more like when you try to fix a junction box and the wires keep slipping. He offers help, but I keep thinking, 'Just let me handle it.' His hand on mine feels like a good fix, but I still see the gaps in the circuit. I guess... I fear he’s looking at a liability instead of a partner. And that’s a screw I can’t tighten.

interviewer: It sounds like the fear of being a burden is adding to the weight you're carrying... What values or goals in your relationship are most important to you right now, even amidst these challenges?

patient: Partnership, I guess. Like… a good junction box—two sides that fit without gaps. But I keep worrying I’m frayed wires, making him work harder to keep things… stable. I don’t want him to feel like he’s patching me up. I’d rather just tighten my own bolts, even if it takes longer.

interviewer: It sounds like the fear of being a burden is deeply tied to your sense of partnership... How do you typically navigate moments when this fear affects your interactions with your husband?

patient: It's like... the motor's still running, you know? He keeps things going, but I try to compensate where I can. Like arriving early to avoid the rush. It's just... coffee helps me keep up, but I know the parts are wearing out. I'm not making this up—I just don't want him to see the frayed wires.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re putting a lot of effort into maintaining stability despite feeling worn out... What specific strategies have you found most helpful in managing stress or maintaining your role at home and work, even when things feel overwhelming?

patient: I stick to the routine—arrive early, check tools twice, tackle one bolt at a time. Coffee’s my... temporary fix, but it buys me focus. I guess that’s just how I’ve always managed. The rest... well, you learn to ignore the parts that don’t hold, right?

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: I don’t... I don’t think about harming myself. That’s not it. But sometimes I lie there at night, staring at the ceiling, and just wonder if the motor’ll ever kick back on. To be honest, I’ve had days where... well, I’d miss the kids, but the rest of it? It feels like it’d just settle on its own. But that’s not the same as planning anything. Coffee keeps the wheels turning, even if they’re rusty.

interviewer: I hear how heavy that feels—like trying to keep a motor running on fumes. Have you been using alcohol or cannabis, or any other substances, to cope with these feelings?

patient: No, nothing like that. I mean... once in a while, a glass of wine. Not to get drunk, just... to reset the circuit, you know? But I try to limit it. My husband wouldn’t approve if he knew. To be honest, even that feels like cheating. I should be fixing this without shortcuts.

interviewer: It sounds like the wine feels like a small compromise you're making with yourself. Have you used any other substances, like cannabis or stimulants, to cope with these feelings or fatigue?

patient: Nope. Just coffee. I mean, I’ve thought about... maybe an energy drink once? But that’s about it. Can’t afford to mess up the wiring any more than it already is. My husband’d kill me if he knew I was experimenting. To be honest, I’d rather just keep fiddling with the coffee machine than try anything else. At least I know how to troubleshoot that.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness about managing things on your own. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, prescribed or over-the-counter, including things like sleep aids or vitamins?

patient: No medications or supplements, really. Just... coffee. A lot of it. Keeps the motor running, I guess. I tried a sleep aid once but it messed with my head the next day. Can't risk that with the job.

interviewer: It sounds like coffee is your main way to manage fatigue right now. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels lately—like feeling more energetic than usual, or perhaps restless or agitated even after little sleep?

patient: The coffee... it's like trying to start a motor with a weak battery. It kicks in for a while, but then I just feel like I'm running on fumes. I'm not restless, exactly—I'm more like... slowed down. Like the gears are stuck in low gear. Even when I do get a little energy, it's not the same as it used to be. It's hard to explain.

interviewer: It sounds like your energy levels have been consistently low lately. Have you had any periods recently where you felt unusually high-energy, restless, or needed less sleep than usual?

patient: No, it’s been all low gear. Even when I try to push through, I just crash harder. The coffee helps for a while, but then I’m dragging again. I’ve started taking short breaks at work to avoid making more mistakes—I can’t afford another warning.

interviewer: It sounds like your energy has been consistently low without any shifts toward restlessness or overactivity. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking or perceptions, like hearing voices, seeing things others don't, or having thoughts that feel unusual or paranoid?

patient: No, nothing like that. I’m not making this up, but… my mind feels foggy sometimes, like a system with a software glitch. I’ll reach for a tool and second-guess myself—‘Did I wire that right yesterday?’ It’s just fatigue, I guess. My dad always said precision matters, but now I’m scared I’m one mistake away from another warning.

interviewer: I hear how concerning the foggy thinking and second-guessing must be for you, especially with the demands of your job. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain that might be contributing to your fatigue or difficulty concentrating?

patient: No, nothing officially diagnosed. I’ve thought about getting my thyroid checked—my mom had issues with that, but she’s got other… things now. (Pauses, fidgets with coffee cup.) The doc at the clinic mentioned sleep apnea once, but I brushed it off. I’m just getting older, right? My dad always said ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’—but what if the motor’s just… worn out?

interviewer: Thank you for sharing so openly today. Let's make sure we have a clear plan moving forward—would you be comfortable with scheduling our next session in two weeks to check in on how the strategies we discussed are working for you?

patient: Two weeks sounds... reasonable. I’ll need to keep the coffee machine on me, but other than that, I’ll try not to let anything slip. If the motor holds, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like you're leaning on the coffee machine to keep things running—how does that strategy feel for you right now?

patient: It buys me time, sure. Keeps the fog at bay for a bit, but the crash comes eventually. I’m not making this up—my hands still shake a little when I wire a junction box now. To be honest, I’ve just gotten used to the noise in the background. It’s... manageable. As long as the parts don’t fail before the next check-in.

interviewer: It sounds like you're navigating a lot with the coffee machine as your main tool—let's make sure we're on track for our next session in two weeks. Is there anything else you'd like to address before we wrap up today?

patient: No, I think we’ve covered the main issues. The parts are holding for now. My husband says I should take it easier, but I can’t just sit around—there’s work to do. I’ll… keep adjusting the settings. See if the motor holds till next time.
