system: Disorder: PPD

interviewer: Kimberly, it's good to meet you. Before we start, is there a specific name or pronoun you'd prefer me to use?

patient: It's Kimberly Stanley. Use 'she' if you must. Why? You gonna file that somewhere I don't know about?

interviewer: I understand your concern about privacy—I assure you, your information is kept strictly confidential. Are you comfortable proceeding with the interview today?

patient: Confidential? Sure. But you’ll be the one signing those forms, right? I’ve known people who ‘forgot’ to check the right box. But… we’ll see. I’m not made of money to waste time on paperwork games.

interviewer: I understand your concerns about the process—let’s clarify how today will go. Would you like me to briefly explain what we’ll be discussing?

patient: I’ll listen, but you start. What’s the plan? I’ve been burned enough to know when someone’s circling. Last time someone promised ‘straight answers,’ it turned into a maze. You’re not my father, I hope, always rerouting the truth.

interviewer: I understand your concerns about the process being unclear—let’s keep it straightforward. Would you like me to briefly outline how our time together will proceed?

patient: You start. I’ve been burned before where the ‘plan’ was just a setup. Last guy promised straight talk but it turned into a maze. You’re not like that, right? I’m not asking for much—just no rerouting the truth like my old man did.

interviewer: I hear your concerns about being misled before. Would you like me to explain the purpose of today’s session?

patient: I guess... as long as you're not just gathering more to use against me later. My father had a way with questions too. You answer, then they twist it until it don't matter what you said. But I'll listen. Got nothing but time, right?

interviewer: It sounds like past experiences have made it really hard to trust the process. Would you be comfortable proceeding with the interview today?

patient: I’ll play along—for now. But we stick to the facts, no riddles. My father had a way of making you circle the same question until you forgot what you were talking about. As long as we don’t go down that road… I’ve got herbs to tend when I’m done here. They don’t lie, you know.

interviewer: I understand how past experiences can shape the way we approach conversations. Do you understand the purpose of today's session?

patient: Purpose? To sort out if you’re another one of those ‘let’s circle the question’ types. As long as we stick to the facts, no double-backing. My herbs need tending, so we keep it straightforward. You don’t ask about the brother, I don’t ask why you’re really here. Deal?

interviewer: Can you tell me about what's been most troubling for you lately?

patient: It’s the usual. People not being straight with you. At work, they say one thing, do another. Then there’s Carlos… he’s been busy. But I’m not the one with issues, right? You’re here to help, not to… what, collect stories? I’ve got enough of those already.

interviewer: That sounds really frustrating. When did you first start noticing people at work acting this way?

patient: Since day one. You learn real fast who’s got your back when you’re cleaning up after others. My father taught me that trust’s a luxury. But my herbs? They don’t play games.

interviewer: It sounds like distrust has been a long-standing challenge for you. How has this situation at work and home evolved since it started? Have things gotten better, worse, or stayed the same?

patient: Work's the same old grind. You don't want to hear about scrubbing floors and managers breathing down your neck. My herbs? They grow straight—no hidden agendas there. Carlos is... busy. People always got something to hide, though. Why does it matter how long this has been going on? You just need the basics to fill your little form, right?

interviewer: It sounds like you’re feeling frustrated with the process. What would you most like to achieve through this session?

patient: Get to the point without all the circling. I ain't here to rehash old ground—just want to show I’m not the one twisting things. My herbs grow straight, same as I do. You keep asking the same questions, though. Makes me wonder who’s really being tested here.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling tested or scrutinized. Can you share more about what makes you wonder if you're being tested here?

patient: Testing? Maybe you’re the one checking if I’ll crack. I keep my herbs in straight rows—no tricks there. You ask questions like you’re waiting for me to slip, but I’ve seen that act before. What’s not on the records you’re scribbling? That’s the real test, ain’t it?

interviewer: I want to be clear that my goal here is to understand your experience without judgment. Can you describe what happened with your co-worker last week that made you feel you needed to seek help?

patient: Maria’s been ‘chatting’ with Mr. Harris again, same old. I double-checked my logs three times—ain’t gonna let someone twist a typo into a complaint. You think I’m the one with the problem? My herbs grow straight, but people? They water them with lies.

interviewer: It sounds like that incident was really validating for you. How has this situation with Maria and Mr. Harris affected your ability to focus at work or feel safe in your role?

patient: I triple-check my logs now. Can’t let a chat turn into a trap. You want the story or the truth? My herbs don’t lie, but people? They water ’em with secrets.

interviewer: It sounds like this sense of being watched or lied about has been really overwhelming for you. Have you experienced similar situations in the past where you felt people were deceiving you?

patient: I’m not one to trust easy, if that’s what you’re getting at. My father always said, ‘Assume, and you’re already behind.’ At work, people try to twist logs, emails—anything—to make you look bad. You gotta check twice, triple, just to prove you’re not being framed. Why do you keep circling back to the same stories? You think I’d just… spill everything?

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about this—let's focus on what's most relevant to you. Have you experienced similar situations in the past where you felt people were deceiving you?

patient: You think my herbs are the only things that don’t lie? Try asking Carlos’s brother about the money he borrowed. But why drag that up? You’re just like the rest—digging where it doesn’t matter.

interviewer: I hear how frustrating it is when people dismiss what feels important to you. How does the memory of Carlos’s brother and the money come up for you now?

patient: That brother? He’s got a history of vanishing when things get tight. Just like my father—promises, empty hands. You really think that’s none of your business?

interviewer: It sounds like the patterns of broken promises in your family have left a lasting impact. How do these experiences shape the way you see others' intentions in your current situations?

patient: My father taught me to expect the worst. If they make a promise, they’ll twist it into a lie later. Carlos’s brother? Same song—borrows money, disappears. You keep asking about this like it’s a puzzle, but it’s not. People either take or they don’t. Why do you care so much about the same old stories?

interviewer: I hear how frustrating it is when people dismiss what matters to you. How have your husband's recent actions affected your sense of security at home?

patient: He’s been missing calls, meetings. You think I don’t notice? My father did the same—gone late, secrets. Now Carlos? Maybe same song. Why you keep fishing for this?

interviewer: I hear how deeply these patterns of broken trust have shaped your view of relationships. How do you think your experiences with your father and Carlos’s brother influence how you interpret your husband’s recent behavior?

patient: You think I don’t see the patterns? My father kept secrets, Carlos’s brother vanished with our money—so yeah, when he starts missing calls or acting odd, I’m not just being ‘sensitive.’ People think I make things up, but I’ve learned to notice the signs before they turn into something worse. Why do you keep circling back to the same old stories?

interviewer: I hear how frustrating it feels when these patterns are repeatedly questioned. Have you experienced similar situations in the past where your suspicions about someone’s behavior turned out to be accurate—or were dismissed before they escalated?

patient: You think I haven’t been right before? My father? He was hiding money from the family for years—everyone said I was ‘dramatic’ for bringing it up. Then he skipped town. At work, I caught a cleaner stealing supplies once. They wrote it off as me ‘overreacting’ till the manager got audited. Now? I don’t wait for proof. I act before they can gaslight me again.

interviewer: It sounds like your past experiences have taught you to be proactive in protecting yourself. Can you think of another time when your suspicions about someone turned out to be correct, and how did you handle that situation?

patient: At work, I caught a colleague taking extra supplies. They said I was overreacting till the manager found out. Now I don’t wait for proof. I lock up the storeroom myself. You want me to trust till it’s too late? I don’t got time for that.

interviewer: I hear how your proactive approach helps you feel in control. What helped you feel more in control during that situation with the colleague taking supplies?

patient: I locked the storeroom myself after that. If you wait for proof, they’ll gaslight you into thinking you’re the problem. Why do you keep thinking I’m overreacting? I’m just making sure the truth don’t get washed away in someone else’s story.

interviewer: I can see how stressful this has been for you. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life in the past few weeks?

patient: I don’t dwell on that. You think I’d waste time on something like that when there’s real problems? People who think I’m lying about the storeroom or Carlos’s calls. I deal with the truth, not that.

interviewer: It must be really frustrating to feel like your concerns aren't being taken seriously. Have you experienced any periods in the past few weeks where you felt unusually energetic, needed less sleep, or took more risks than usual?

patient: I don’t know, maybe if I had time for that. I’m too busy making sure the work gets done right. Why does that matter?

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to maintain control is really weighing on you. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or having thoughts that feel foreign to you?

patient: Nope. Voices? I’ve got enough of those in real life. If I heard something else, you think I’d be dumb enough not to notice? People talk, that’s all. You want to know why I double-check every log entry? Because they don’t. But sure, let’s pretend I’m the crazy one here.

interviewer: It sounds like you're clear on distinguishing between real conversations and what others might perceive as 'voices.' Have you noticed any changes in your use of alcohol, marijuana, or other substances recently?

patient: I don’t have time for that. Wine’s for cleaning, not drinking. You’re just trying to pin something on me to make this harder. I do what I need to stay sharp at work—unlike some people who’d rather twist the truth than admit they’re missing pieces.

interviewer: It sounds like you're focused on staying sharp for your work. Have you used any medications, supplements, or other substances besides alcohol recently to help with that?

patient: No meds, no supplements. I don’t need shortcuts. You’re just looking for a way to say I’m slacking, but my work speaks for itself. Why the sudden interest in my habits?

interviewer: I can see how frustrating it is to feel misunderstood. Are there any activities, people, or routines that help you manage stress or stay grounded when situations feel overwhelming?

patient: I’ve got my herbs to take care of. They don’t lie, so I stick to that. The rest? People talk, people scheme. I’d rather keep to myself than wait for the next trick.

interviewer: Have you ever been diagnosed with a medical condition that affects your sleep or daily functioning, such as thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain?

patient: No medical conditions. I handle things myself—cheap wine, herbs. Why the sudden interest in my habits? You think I’m hiding something?

interviewer: It sounds like herbs are an important part of your self-care routine. Could you clarify if you're using any specific herbs or remedies for managing stress or sleep?

patient: They help, but I don’t mix them with anything. Why? You think a plant’s gonna spill my secrets to someone?

interviewer: Kimberly, if I understand correctly, your current struggles with trusting others—especially at work and in your marriage—seem linked to longstanding patterns of feeling betrayed or dismissed, like with your father and past coworkers. These experiences have led you to stay hyper-vigilant, like checking logs or monitoring your husband’s behavior, which helps you feel in control but also makes it harder to focus at work and feel safe. Is there anything I’m missing or misrepresenting here?

patient: You’re not wrong about the vigilance, but you’re missing the bigger picture. People twist things until you’re the problem, just like my father. The herbs? They don’t lie, but people? That’s a different story. I keep the logs to prove I’m not the one slipping up—again.

interviewer: It sounds like your experiences with your father and others have deepened your need to document and prove your clarity, especially when others try to shift blame. What did I miss about how this pattern plays out in your life now?

patient: You didn’t mention the brother who borrowed money and vanished. Now I’m watching him like he’s got a loaded gun in his pocket. People think I’m ‘too sensitive’ about Carlos checking his phone, but I’ve seen the pattern—once, I was 16 and pregnant, and the world just… turned. Now I keep logs at work, triple-check the storeroom locks. If someone wants to twist the truth, let them try. The mint on my windowsill? It don’t care who’s lying. It just grows straight.

interviewer: Kimberly, to clarify, your current hypervigilance and need for control seem tied to longstanding patterns of betrayal, including your father, your brother’s financial disappearance, and past experiences like the one at 16. These events have likely reinforced your belief that others will 'turn' on you, leading to strategies like documenting and securing your environment to avoid being gaslighted. What have I missed about how these patterns show up in your life now?

patient: You didn’t ask about the new janitor, Mark. Always asking for shortcuts, says I’m ‘overdoing it’ checking the logs. Last week, he missed a report—and suddenly I’m the one in trouble. My mint plant? It don’t ask questions. It just grows. People? They water it with lies.

interviewer: Kimberly, to recap: your current struggles center on distrust at work—especially with Mark and others who dismiss your vigilance—and in your marriage, where your husband’s secrecy feels like a repeat of past betrayals. You’ve developed strategies like documenting logs and securing your environment to stay in control, but this hypervigilance is affecting your focus and relationships. Underlying this are patterns from childhood, like your father’s manipulation and your brother’s disappearance, which reinforce your belief that people twist the truth. What have I missed or misrepresented here?

patient: You got the basics, I guess. But you missed the part where Mark’s been ‘accidentally’ leaving his keys in the storeroom. Like, why would he do that unless he’s trying to make me look like the problem? And my brother—yeah, he took the money and vanished, but you’re not asking why Carlos lets him stay around. Still, I keep my logs clean. At least the herbs grow straight. You think I should trust people more? Or just be thankful I’ve got something that doesn’t lie?

interviewer: It sounds like Mark’s behavior with the keys feels like another example of people trying to shift blame onto you, and your brother’s situation with Carlos adds to the sense that others aren’t holding people accountable. What else have I missed about how these patterns show up in your life now?

patient: You missed the part where the logs I keep? Someone’s been moving them. I check twice daily now. You think I’m overreacting? My mint doesn’t twist the truth. And Carlos’s missed calls? Same song, different verse. You gonna tell me I’m the problem again?

interviewer: It sounds like the logs being moved is adding to your sense of being targeted, even as you’re trying to stay methodical. How often have you noticed the logs being disturbed, and have you noticed a pattern to when it happens?

patient: It happens when people are around. You think I should just let them mess with my stuff? My mint don’t lie, but Carlos’s brother’s still out there waiting for a chance.

interviewer: It sounds like the logs being disturbed when others are around adds to your sense of being targeted, and the mint remains a symbol of your need for truth. What would you like us to focus on next to address these concerns?

patient: Focus on why Carlos lets his brother stay around. The logs being moved? That's just more of the same. You want truth? My mint don't lie, but people... they water it with lies. You think I should just let them twist the records again?

interviewer: I hear how frustrating it is that Carlos lets his brother stay around despite the risks it seems to create, and how the logs being moved feel like part of a larger pattern of being undermined. What else have I missed or misrepresented about your experience here?

patient: You missed the part where Carlos’s brother took that money and didn’t pay back a dime. Now he’s still under our roof, siphoning what’s left. And the logs? Someone’s rearranging them to make it look like *I’m* the one causing the mess. You think I should just let people twist my records and my life? My mint grows straight, but people? They bend the truth till it’s unrecognizable.

interviewer: I hear how the ongoing financial betrayal by Carlos’s brother and the tampered logs feel like deliberate attacks on your integrity. Before we finalize next steps, is there anything else I’ve missed about how these patterns are shaping your experience now?

patient: The herbs on my windowsill don’t lie, but people? They twist the truth till it’s unrecognizable. Carlos’s brother’s debt? That’s just another ledger they’ll try to balance on my back. Why does any of this matter if not to pin it on me?

interviewer: Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up today?

patient: Nope. You’ve got your notes. Just like my father, circling the same old questions. The mint on my windowsill don’t twist the truth, but these sessions do. Why does it matter if I’m done?

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with the process and want clarity on why these conversations matter. Before we wrap up, can you share one thing you hope to have resolved or acknowledged by our next session?

patient: Hope you stop thinking my way’s the problem. The logs get messed with when others are around. Maybe you’ll admit someone’s actually messing with them, not me overdoing it. Or just leave the herbs outta it—they don’t need a manual to stay real.

interviewer: It sounds like the integrity of your logs and the role of the herbs are central to how you’re making sense of things. Before we close, can you share what you hope we’ll clarify about these in our next session?

patient: I hope you stop treating my logs like a riddle I’m supposed to solve alone. The numbers don’t lie, but someone’s always rearranging them when I turn my back. And the herbs? They’re just there—no double meanings, no hidden agendas. Maybe next time we can talk about why you keep circling the same old stories instead of the fact that the mint leaves are still growing straight.

interviewer: It sounds like your focus on the integrity of your logs and the straightforward nature of the herbs is really important to you. Before we close, can you confirm what specific next steps you’d like us to prioritize moving forward?

patient: Next steps? You keep asking like you’re the one in charge. I don’t need steps—I need you to admit the logs get messed with when others are around. And Carlos’s brother? He’s the reason we’re here. Why’s your head in the past when the problem’s right in front of you? The mint doesn’t ask questions. It just grows. Maybe start there.

interviewer: It sounds like your focus on the logs’ integrity and Carlos’s brother’s role is central to your trust in this process. Before we close, let’s clarify: Would it help to schedule a specific next step where we revisit these concerns in detail?

patient: Another meeting? You think I’ve got time for more loops? My logs don’t need your ‘next steps’—they either stay clean or they don’t. If you want to talk, ask about the mint on my windowsill. It don’t lie, unlike some people’s questions.
