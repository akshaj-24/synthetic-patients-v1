system: Session 74cf14fd-d7f9-4b26-acc3-b22d42a72284 transcript

system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Chelsea. Would you be comfortable with me explaining how today's session will go?

patient: Sure, I guess. I like to have a plan, you know? Like how I color-code my pill bottles or double-check the diner orders. It keeps me from... getting behind. Though half the time my mind’s still racing anyway.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing how important planning is for you. Before we move forward, would you like me to explain the purpose and structure of today’s session, or do you have any questions first?

patient: Sure, go ahead. I think it’s good to know what to expect, like how I like to check the diner’s schedule twice before opening. I’ve been trying to keep my head on straight lately, but… (taps fingers on knee under table) sometimes my thoughts just loop like the coffee machine. You know, ‘did I turn that off, did I turn that off…’

interviewer: It sounds like the looping thoughts are really wearing on you. Would you be okay with me continuing with the explanation of how today’s session will work, or is there something else you’d like to start with?

patient: Yeah, go ahead. I like having a plan, like my pill bottles. Helps me not... you know, get behind. Though my fingers still tap sometimes, even when I try not to let them. (pauses, glances at hands in lap) It’s just... how it is, right? You need structure to keep the gears from grinding.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to manage. Do you consent to proceed with today's session so we can explore ways to support you?

patient: Yeah, I guess. As long as we take it step by step, like the diner schedule. I’ve got these antacids in my bag if I need to... focus. (pauses, fingers still tapping lightly on knee) But if it gets too much, can we pause? Like how I reset the coffee machine when it’s stuck?

interviewer: It sounds like you've been feeling overwhelmed and stuck in a high-alert state, with worries affecting your job and sleep. When did you first start noticing these feelings of being overwhelmed and on high alert?

patient: It’s been there a long time, like a low growl. Started with the diner, maybe? Always feeling the gears grinding, you know? Even as a kid, my mom used to say worry was preparation. Now it’s just… this hum. The antacids help, weirdly. They’re solid in my pocket. Like, if I can hold something real, maybe the rest won’t fall apart.

interviewer: It sounds like holding the antacids gives you a sense of grounding amidst the uncertainty. Have you noticed any specific times when these feelings have gotten worse, or any recent changes that might have made things more difficult?

patient: The boss gave me a warning last month about the coffee machine—said I was ‘spacing out’ when I’m supposed to be refilling. It’s not that I’m not paying attention… it’s just that my hands start trembling sometimes, and I have to check the machine three times to make sure it’s not going to overflow. The doctor mentioned my blood pressure, too. And there’s… family stuff I haven’t even sorted out in my head yet. But the antacids? They’re still my best bet for feeling like I’m holding it all together.

interviewer: It sounds like there are some unresolved family matters adding to your stress. How has that been affecting you lately?

patient: It’s… hard to explain, really. My daughter’s going through some things, but I don’t want to drag anyone into it. I just make sure the rent’s covered, you know? It’s part of the gears. But sometimes at night, I’ll lie awake and my hands start shaking, like they did with the coffee machine. I check the locks three times. Maybe that’s just how it is. Did you eat yet?

interviewer: It sounds like checking the locks gives you a way to manage the shaking and nighttime worries. How long have you been checking the locks multiple times at night?

patient: It’s been... years, I suppose. Since the kids were little? You know how it is. But lately, the hands shake more. Did you eat yet?

interviewer: It sounds like the shaking has become more pronounced recently, even though the checking behavior has been part of your routine for years. How has this increased shaking affected your work at the diner or other daily tasks?

patient: It’s… harder to keep up with the coffee machine now. My hands shake so bad sometimes, I spill more than I should. I have to set the antacids down first, you know? Like, if I can just steady myself with something solid… but the boss hasn’t said anything else, so I guess it’s manageable. Did you have time for lunch before this?

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing how the shaking impacts your work and routines. What would you most hope to achieve through coming in for support right now?

patient: I guess... I just want to be able to hold things together a little better. The shaking at the diner—it’s embarrassing, you know? I don’t want to mess up the coffee machine again. Maybe learn to... I don’t know, relax a bit? But honestly, I’m more worried about how my day’s going to go than talking about it. Did you have a good breakfast?

interviewer: Have you experienced similar episodes of anxiety or stress in the past, and if so, what helped you manage them at the time?

patient: I’ve always had this... background hum, I guess. When the diner gets busy, I start checking the coffee machine three times just to be sure. It helps a little, or maybe it’s just something to do with my hands so I don’t fidget too much. The antacids in my pocket? Feels like they ground me, even if it’s just... a solid weight. Did you need anything from the water fountain?

interviewer: It sounds like the antacids and structured routines help you feel more grounded when things get overwhelming. Who have you found yourself turning to for support during especially stressful times?

patient: Honestly, I don’t... I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this stuff. It’s just me and the routines, you know? The antacids, checking the coffee machine—those things keep me steady. I guess I don’t want to drag anyone else into it. Did you have time for lunch yet?

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve been relying a lot on these routines to cope with the stress… Have you ever tried working with a therapist or counselor before to help manage this kind of overwhelm?

patient: Not really... I tried once, years ago, but it felt like talking about the same gears grinding in different words. I guess I just... stick with what I know, you know? The routines. The antacids. They work, even if they’re just... placeholders. Did you have time for lunch today?

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve been managing a lot on your own, which can feel really isolating. I’m wondering how your daughter fits into this—have you found it helpful or challenging to navigate these stressors with her?

patient: My daughter... she’s doing okay, I think. She helps with the rent sometimes, but I don’t want to make her feel responsible for me. It’s just me and the diner, you know? The locks—I check them extra when I’m thinking about her. My hands get shaky then, like they do with the coffee machine. Did your commute today go smoothly?

interviewer: It sounds like thoughts of your daughter bring up a mix of love and worry, which seems to intensify your checking behaviors. Can you share how these worries about her specifically affect your anxiety or routines?

patient: Well... it’s like the checking becomes this... this extra layer, you know? If I’m already worried about the locks at night, thinking about her, it’s just... more gears grinding. I’ll count the steps twice, then feel like I need to check the antacids in my pocket, just to have something solid. It’s not really about the locks, I guess. Did you eat yet?

interviewer: It sounds like worries about your daughter add another layer to your checking behaviors... How does her well-being specifically affect how you manage your anxiety or routines?

patient: It’s like... if I’m already second-guessing the locks, thinking about her makes me count the steps again, just to feel like I’m doing something. The antacids in my pocket help, I guess—something solid to hold onto. But my hands still shake sometimes, even when I’m trying to focus. Did you have a good breakfast?

interviewer: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life?

patient: I haven’t... I haven’t gone that far. It’s just the shaking hands, the antacids in my pocket—it’s like I need something solid to hold onto, you know? But no, I haven’t thought about stopping. Did you have time for lunch today?

interviewer: I had a light lunch, thanks for asking. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns lately beyond what you've already mentioned?

patient: I feel more drained lately, like the batteries are just... running low. I catch myself nodding off at the diner during slow shifts, which is odd because I used to stay sharp all day. The sleep? It’s not really sleep, you know—just lying there, counting the locks on the doors again, so my head’s foggy by morning. The chamomile tea helps a little, but my shoulders still ache from... I don’t know, tension? Did your day go okay?

interviewer: It sounds like the chamomile tea is one of the few things that brings you some relief. Have you used alcohol or cannabis in the past month to help with your anxiety or sleep?

patient: No, I don’t use anything like that. Chamomile’s my go-to—just something to do with my hands, you know? The antacids in my pocket help more, even if my hands still shake. Did you need anything else?

interviewer: Are you currently taking any prescription medications, supplements, or over-the-counter drugs besides the antacids you mentioned?

patient: No, just the antacids. And maybe a multivitamin sometimes, but I forget to take it regularly. I brew chamomile tea in the afternoons—keeps my hands busy, I guess. How’s your day been? Did you eat yet?

interviewer: It sounds like the chamomile tea and antacids are important tools for you. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like thyroid issues or sleep apnea, that might contribute to your anxiety or sleep problems?

patient: No, nothing else—just the blood pressure, but that’s probably just stress. The doctor says it’s manageable. How’s your day going? Did you eat yet?

interviewer: It's good to hear that your blood pressure is under control. Have you noticed any recent changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns that might feel different from your usual experience?

patient: Energy? I guess I’m just... tired in a way that doesn’t really go away. Like, even after sleep, my legs feel heavy. The doctor says it’s stress, so I tell myself that’s just part of the job. How’s your lunch shaping up? Did you grab something yet?

interviewer: It sounds like your energy levels have been quite low lately. Have you experienced any periods recently where you felt unusually energetic, restless, or took risks you wouldn’t normally take, even for a short time?

patient: No, I haven’t been feeling restless. Just the usual tiredness, like my legs are made of lead. My hands still shake sometimes, but I tell myself it’s just the coffee machine’s fault. Did you get to eat yet?

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing how your body feels lately. Have you ever experienced things that others couldn’t see or hear—like voices, patterns, or thoughts that felt outside your control—especially when you’re feeling this fatigued?

patient: No, I don’t hear things or see patterns—not like that. My mind just… races with the same old worries. Like the coffee machine malfunctioning or my daughter needing money again. It’s all in my head, I guess. My hands still shake sometimes, but I tell myself it’s just stress. Did you get to eat yet?

interviewer: It sounds like stress plays a big role in how you're experiencing your body right now. Have you ever been told you have thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or other medical conditions that might be connected to your anxiety or fatigue?

patient: No, they’ve never mentioned anything like thyroid issues or apnea. My blood pressure’s been a thing—doctor says it’s stress-related. I just try to keep things steady with my routines. How’s your day going?

interviewer: Chelsea, what I’ve heard so far is that you’ve been managing chronic anxiety with checking rituals and routines to cope with constant worry, physical tension, and sleep problems. These symptoms are affecting your work performance and leaving you feeling isolated, though you’ve maintained stability through structured habits and antacid grounding. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?

patient: You didn’t mention the self-talk, the way I second-guess every decision even when I follow the steps right. Like, I’ll triple-check the coffee machine but still think, *What if I messed up the order?* And the antacids… they’re not just for the hands. They’re a habit, but I worry it’s a crutch. Oh, and the fatigue—it’s not just tired. It’s like my brain’s stuck on loop, replaying the same worries until my legs feel like concrete. How’s your coffee today?

interviewer: It sounds like the self-talk and mental loops are adding a layer of strain beyond the checking behaviors we’ve discussed. Is there anything else you’d like to add to this picture before we discuss next steps?

patient: The loops... they don’t stop even when I’m trying to focus. Like, I’ll be at work, going through the motions, but my head’s still spinning. The antacids in my pocket... they’re not just a habit. It’s like if I don’t have them, I’ll lose that last bit of control. But I know it’s not helping. My shoulders are always tight, like a knot I can’t undo. Did you have a heavy workload today?

interviewer: Chelsea, what I’m hearing is that the mental loops and physical tension are central to your experience, with the antacids serving as a temporary anchor. The fatigue and work-related stress are compounding this, and the self-talk adds a layer of self-criticism. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You didn’t mention the way my shoulders lock up when I’m trying to smile at customers. It’s like my face does the polite thing but my body’s screaming. And the antacids… yeah, they’re not just in my pocket. I count them at night, make sure the ziplock’s sealed. It’s stupid, I know. But if I don’t, what if my hands start shaking so bad I drop the coffee? Did you finish your tea yet?

interviewer: It sounds like the physical tension in your shoulders and the antacid counting add important layers to how anxiety shows up for you. Is there anything else you’d like to add or clarify before we discuss next steps?

patient: I guess I worry that if I slow down, everyone will see how... shaky I really am. Even though I try to keep up, it feels like one mistake could make everything fall apart. Did you have to rush between meetings today?

interviewer: Chelsea, what I’m hearing is that your fear of being seen as ‘shaky’ or flawed feels deeply tied to your need to maintain control through constant motion and perfectionism, especially at work. This fear of collapse—both literal and metaphorical—might be amplifying the loops and checking rituals you described. Is there anything else you’d like to add before we discuss next steps?

patient: It’s like… the coffee machine at work. If I don’t check the pressure gauge every five minutes, I’m convinced it’ll blow a gasket. I keep telling myself the antacids are just for ‘preparing for the day,’ but my hands still shake when I count them out. You ever notice how your legs feel like lead weights even after a full night’s sleep? … Did you eat yet? I could use a second opinion on this chamomile tea—does the bag look damp enough to matter?

interviewer: Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up today? I'm here to help clarify or address anything on your mind.

patient: The locks… I check them twice, sometimes three times. It’s not that I think someone’s coming in, just… if I didn’t, would it mean I’m not trying hard enough? My hands still tremble when I pour the tea. … You know, I brought extra chamomile bags in case the humidity makes them蔫. Did you have time to grab lunch before this?

interviewer: That sounds really challenging. Before we wrap up, can you share what steps you'd like to focus on moving forward to manage the checking and trembling?

patient: I guess… maybe start with the pill bottles. If I color-code them better, maybe the checking won’t take so long. And the chamomile tea—maybe brew it weaker? Less damp bags, less… shaking when I pour. But I don’t want to sound nuts about the locks. It’s just… being thorough, right? … Did you want a cup of tea while we talk? I could use a second set of hands to open the box.

interviewer: That sounds like a thoughtful plan to manage the checking and trembling. Before we wrap up, would you like to review these steps again to ensure they feel clear and doable for you?

patient: The pill bottles—color-coding them sounds doable, as long as I don’t mix up the markers. And the tea… weaker brew, yeah. But the locks? I guess three times is just… being thorough. My hands still tremble when I pour, though. … You didn’t have time for lunch, did you? I brought an extra bag of chamomile if you’re hungry.

interviewer: That was kind of you to offer—let’s savor this moment. Before we close, is there anything else you’d like to clarify or prioritize for our next steps?

patient: The pill bottles… maybe I’ll try labeling them with Sharpie instead of markers. Less smudgy that way. And the tea—yeah, weaker brew. But the locks? Three times is just… standard operating procedure. My hands still tremble when I pour, though. … You didn’t get to eat yet, did you? I’ve got an extra bag if you’re still hungry.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve thought through practical steps to manage the checking and trembling. Would you like to adjust that plan or need support with anything specific before we close today?

patient: I—I think the plan’s… it’s solid, really. The antacids, the checking, the coffee machine routine—it’s just… it’s what keeps me from falling apart, you know? But my hands still shake sometimes, even when I’m ‘being thorough.’ I guess I could try… adding another minute of tea time before bed? If that’s not too much. And maybe… maybe you could just remind me that three checks of the locks aren’t *actually* too many? For now, though, I’d rather not jumble things up. It’s… it’s working, in the way that gears grinding do.

interviewer: It makes sense to honor the plan that feels most stabilizing for you right now. Let’s note that three lock checks can stay as your standard for now, and we’ll revisit adjustments if needed. Would you like to schedule our next session to review how this plan is working for you?

patient: Yeah, scheduling another session… that sounds… responsible. Like the tea time addition. If it’s not too much trouble. And the lock checks—three is standard, right? I’ll… try not to jumble things. My hands still tremble a bit, but the tea helps, I guess. You know, keeping them busy. Do you need to write it down? Or… how’s your schedule looking?
