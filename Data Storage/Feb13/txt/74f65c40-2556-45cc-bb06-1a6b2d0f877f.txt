system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, John. I want to make sure we take this at your pace. Would you be comfortable proceeding with our conversation today?

patient: I... I guess. As long as we don’t get stuck on the boring parts. My brain’s like that laptop battery—sometimes it powers through, sometimes it just... dies. (Pauses, rubs neck slowly.) But if you need me to keep going, I’ll try.

interviewer: Thank you for being open about this, John. Before we continue, do you have any questions about what this session will involve or how it might help?

patient: Not really... Maybe just how long this will take? I don’t want to... you know, waste your time if my brain’s just going to shut down halfway. (Pauses, avoids eye contact.) But honestly, I’ve got more experience with laptops than therapy, so... (Forces a dry chuckle.) Let’s just say I’m here, and go from there.

interviewer: Can you tell me what's been bringing you to therapy right now?

patient: It’s... hard to pin down, really. (Sighs, fidgets with coffee cup.) The research project ate up all my time, and Lina’s been juggling her business while I... I just stopped keeping up. (Voice drops, avoids eye contact.) Missed two client appointments, and I can’t even remember why I agreed to them. My mind’s like that laptop—powers on, but everything’s sluggish. (Forces a half-smile.) The washing machine’s been broken for weeks. Maybe I’m just bad at... functioning.

interviewer: That sounds really frustrating and exhausting. When did you first start noticing these changes in your energy and focus?

patient: It’s been... a while. Maybe six months? (Pauses, rubs neck again.) At first, I told myself it was just the research project—nonstop deadlines, that kind of thing. But even after that slowed down, I still felt like my battery’s been... partially drained forever. (Avoids eye contact, voice flattens.) Like I’m just... coasting through things now.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. Can you share an example of a recent situation where you felt yourself snapping at your partner over something small?

patient: There was that time last week when she suggested we move her work meeting to Sunday... I snapped about the washing machine breaking down again, even though I knew it wasn't the right moment. My hands were shaking while I said it, like they always do when I'm about to regret something. I called her 'selfish' and immediately wished I could swallow the words back—she's the one working double shifts, but I just... feel like a grumpy old man these days. I apologized three times after, rambling about how I'm 'not sleeping enough,' which is the only excuse my brain can muster.

interviewer: It sounds like these moments leave you with a lot of guilt. How have these conflicts been affecting your relationship with your partner overall?

patient: It’s like... we’re both trying to navigate a storm with one hand tied behind our backs. She’s been so resilient, picking up the pieces without complaint, but I can see the cracks in her patience now—how she hesitates before suggesting plans, like she’s waiting for me to derail it. We still have these small rituals, like making barako coffee together, but even then, I catch myself zoning out or second-guessing if I’m worth the effort. I tell myself it’s temporary, but what if it’s just me slowly eroding the trust she has in us?

interviewer: It sounds like the strain on your relationship is really weighing on you. What are you hoping to get out of therapy as we move forward?

patient: I guess... I want to stop being such a wreck around her. Not the grand stuff, just—like—learning how to not let my head turn everything into static. I keep thinking if I could just... stop apologizing so much, maybe she wouldn’t have to work so hard to hear me. But honestly? Half of me expects this is all just... temporary fixes for a system that’s already fried.

interviewer: It sounds like these symptoms feel quite overwhelming. Have you experienced periods in the past where you felt similarly drained or disconnected?

patient: I guess I’ve had busy stretches before, but this feels different. It’s like... when you’re on a long drive and your eyes keep closing, but even after sleeping, the road still feels endless. I don’t know—this just isn’t passing like regular burnout.

interviewer: That persistent fatigue you're describing does sound distinct from typical burnout. When you say this feels different, what specific aspects of your current experience stand out compared to past busy periods?

patient: It’s like... before, even when I was swamped, I could still force myself to crack a joke or finish a meal with Lina. Now, even after sleeping, I wake up like I’ve been carrying sandbags all night. The guilt over snapping at her—it’s not just the arguments, it’s that I used to *look forward* to her energy, you know? Now I just... drain her, and I can see it in her eyes. It’s not burnout. Burnout fixes. This feels like a leak I can’t patch.

interviewer: It sounds like the strain in your relationship with Lina is adding to your sense of isolation. How has this affected your interactions with her lately?

patient: It’s... complicated. I keep expecting her to push back, but she just... absorbs it. Like the other day, I snapped about the washing machine breaking down—again—and she just said, ‘We’ll fix it tomorrow.’ As if. I’m not even sure why I take it out on her. Maybe because I feel like I’m failing at everything else. The missed meetings, the way I zone out when she tries to talk... I hate that she’s the one picking up the pieces. But I can’t help thinking I’m just dragging her down.

interviewer: It sounds like you carry a lot of guilt about the strain on your relationship. How does Lina typically respond when you're feeling overwhelmed or irritable?

patient: She just... absorbs it. Like she's used to carrying the weight. I keep thinking I'm adding to her stress, but she never says it outright. It's like I'm this... deadweight she keeps trying to lift, and I hate that she has to. Some days, I wonder if I'm even worth the effort.

interviewer: It's clear how much this weighs on you. When these feelings arise, do you have any strategies or moments where you feel you're able to shift that perspective, even slightly?

patient: Honestly? Not really. I’ll... force myself to brew barako in the morning, just to have something routine. Or I’ll watch that same medical drama episode on loop—it’s stupid, but the predictability helps. But most days, I just... hold my breath until it passes. Like I’m waiting for the storm to end, but I keep forgetting storms don’t just stop because I want them to.

interviewer: It sounds like those small routines give you some anchor when everything else feels unstable. Have you experienced similar periods in your life where you felt this kind of emotional or mental 'storm,' and if so, what, if anything, helped you navigate through it before?

patient: Burnout, maybe. Years ago, after shifts at the clinic, I’d lock myself in books or patient charts to distract. It worked... until it didn’t. Now, even that feels like flipping through a manual in the dark. The difference is, back then, I could still convince myself it was temporary. This? It’s like the laptop battery’s finally given up, and I’m just waiting for the screen to go black. I worry Lina’s used to me dimming—like she’ll just... keep fixing the washing machine forever.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy weight to carry, both for you and Lina. It’s clear she’s been trying to hold things together for you—have there been moments, even small ones, where you’ve felt her support or connection despite the strain?

patient: Once, after I snapped about the washing machine, she just... left a cup of barako on the counter the next morning. No note, no eye contact—just the coffee. I almost made myself drink it all in one go to prove I wasn’t a total mess. But then I spilled half down the sink. Static, right? That’s what I am—noise she’s just learning to live with.

interviewer: It sounds like that moment with the coffee was both a gesture of care and a reminder of your self-perceived distance. Have there been other times in your life when you felt similarly stuck in a pattern of withdrawing, even when others were trying to support you?

patient: Yeah... there was my dad. He’d always say, ‘You’re smart, but do you care?’ whenever I’d skip family gatherings. I’d just... fold in on myself, you know? Even if my mom tried to bridge the gap. Now with Lina, it’s the same pattern—she’s trying to keep things steady, but I’m like a car with a faulty alternator. I power through, then sputter out. The other day, she made adobo, and I just... couldn’t bring myself to help. Sat there staring at the stove. It’s stupid, really. I should be grateful, but I feel like I’m dragging her down.

interviewer: It sounds like this pattern with Lina echoes dynamics from your relationship with your dad—have you noticed similar cycles of withdrawing and then feeling like a burden in other relationships or life roles over the years?

patient: It’s... harder to put than the Lina thing, but there’s this thing with my mom. I send money home every month, you know? It’s supposed to be about duty, but sometimes I feel like I’m just patching a roof that’s already leaking everywhere. She never asks, but I can hear it in her calls—how she’s managing, how the farm’s doing. I want to be the son who holds it together, but lately, even that feels like I’m borrowing strength I don’t have. It’s not as simple as snapping at someone, though. It’s quieter. Like... fading out the parts of me that used to care about being reliable.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to support your mom adds to the sense of being stretched thin—how has this dynamic affected your ability to manage stress or self-care in the past?

patient: Honestly? It’s like... adding weight to a backpack you’re already struggling to carry. I tell myself sending money home is helping, but it feels like I’m just keeping her from seeing how much I’m falling apart. I used to take pride in being reliable, but now even things like meal prep or sleeping straight through the night feel like optional extras. The guilt’s the worst—like I’m failing her by not being 100%, but also failing Lina when I’m too drained to... just be present. It’s a loop. I’ll admit, though, the worst part is knowing my mom’s used to me being distant. It makes me hate that I’m passing that same quiet withdrawal onto Lina now.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy weight to carry, both for you and Lina. It’s clear she’s been trying to hold things together for you—have there been moments, even small ones, where you’ve felt her support or connection despite the strain?

patient: Yeah... there was this one time she stayed up baking bread for our neighbors to make extra money. I caught her at 2 AM, hands flour-dusted, humming to keep warm. She didn’t even notice me there. It hit me how she’s always... patching things, even when the foundation feels shaky. I wanted to help, but my brain felt like a phone that’s glitching in the static—just... frozen. I told her it was ‘cute’ instead of saying *thank you*. Seems small, but it’s the kind of thing that makes me hate how I can’t return the same kind of steady.

interviewer: It sounds like the thought of disappearing has been really heavy for you. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: I’ve... wondered if I’d just stop showing up one morning. Not in a planful way, though. It’s more like thinking, ‘What if my body just… gave up?’ But the weird part is, I don’t want to disappear. I just… don’t know if I can keep pretending I’m functional. It’s not Lina’s fault, though. If anything, I’m terrified of her finding out how much I’m… fading. It’s like that laptop battery again—sometimes I think, what’s the point of charging it if it’s just going to die anyway?

interviewer: That sounds really heavy... Have you thought about a specific way or method you might use to harm yourself?

patient: I... I haven’t really gone that far. It’s not like I’ve planned it out. Sometimes I just think, what if I just... stopped showing up one morning? But it’s not like there’s a plan. It’s more like the weight of everything feels too heavy to keep carrying. Like trying to hold a broken dam together with your hands.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry... What has kept you from acting on those thoughts of disappearing or giving up?

patient: I... it’s mostly Lina, I guess. She’s been through enough already, and I don’t want to make it worse. Plus, there’s the thing about... if I disappeared, someone’d have to clean up the mess I’ve made at work. Doesn’t sound like much, but it’s the best I can think of right now.

interviewer: I hear how much Lina and your responsibilities mean to you... Are there any other people, activities, or things that help keep you safe or give you a sense of stability right now?

patient: There’s... the medical dramas I watch. Predictable, formulaic stuff. Helps me feel like I’m in control of something, you know? And the coffee—brewing barako properly, even if it’s just me drinking it now. It’s the one thing that feels... solid. Like the grind and the heat and the smell. But it’s probably not what you’re thinking. Small stuff, really.

interviewer: It’s clear those routines matter to you... Have you been using alcohol, cannabis, or other substances more or less than usual lately?

patient: No, I’ve pretty much stuck to... one glass of wine on birthdays. Even then, I’m usually too drained to stay out. My head’s already got enough static without adding fuel to the fire. Coffee’s my drug of choice these days—bitter, grounding, keeps me... present.

interviewer: Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, or have you started/stopped any recently?

patient: No, I haven’t started anything. I guess I’ve been... waiting to see if the system resets on its own. Coffee’s the only thing I rely on, but even that’s just... keeping the battery from dying completely. Sounds stupid, I know.

interviewer: It’s understandable to hold onto routines that feel stable... Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually energetic, needed less sleep, or took more risks than usual?

patient: Not really. Most days feel like... trudging through sand. The only time I’d say I was ‘energetic’ was during that research project—worked 14-hour days for weeks, but that was just survival mode. I’d crash afterward, though. Now, even brewing coffee feels like a marathon. (Pauses, rubs temples.) Why do you ask?

interviewer: That sounds exhausting... Have you had any periods where you felt so energetic that you couldn't slow down or took risks you wouldn't normally take?

patient: Nope. The only time I felt... hyper was during that research project, but it was like a panic-fueled zombie mode. I didn’t sleep, just kept grinding until I collapsed. (Sighs, fingers tapping nervously on the armrest.) But that’s not really what you’re asking, is it?

interviewer: It’s clear that project-driven energy feels different from what I’m asking... Have you ever had other times where you felt unusually energetic or took risks you later regretted, even if it wasn’t during work?

patient: Nope. The only 'risk' I took lately was staying up past 1 AM binge-watching that medical drama again. Even then, I kept hitting pause to check the clock. (Forces a quiet chuckle, fingers still drumming the armrest.) Guess that’s not what you mean, though.

interviewer: It’s interesting how you find stability in routines like coffee and TV... Have you noticed any unusual thoughts, sensations, or experiences that feel real to you but others might not understand, like hearing voices or seeing things that others don’t?

patient: No, nothing like that. Just... my brain feels like it's stuck in a loop sometimes. Like a laptop that's buffering forever. (Fingers tap faster.) Can't even enjoy the coffee without... wondering if I'll just stop caring one day. But that's probably nothing.

interviewer: John, over the past six months, you’ve described persistent fatigue, cognitive slowing, and emotional withdrawal impacting your work and relationship with Lina. You’ve shared passive thoughts of fading away linked to functional decline and guilt over relational strain, but no active safety plan. Your history includes cyclical self-criticism and patterns of emotional withdrawal mirroring past family dynamics, though you’ve also noted stabilizing factors like Lina’s quiet support and small routines. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... I haven’t really talked about how I keep up the monthly money transfers to my mom. It’s just something I do, you know? Even though it feels like a battery I’m draining myself to keep alive. She’d just worry more if I said I’m struggling. (Pauses, fingers digging into the armrest.) But maybe that’s just another way I’m... failing to ask for help.

interviewer: Let me make sure we're aligned on next steps. Our next session is scheduled for two weeks from today. Would you like to review any specific goals for that time?

patient: I’m not sure yet. Maybe... figuring out how to stop letting things pile up? Like, the small stuff—keeping up with work tasks without feeling like I’m just... going through the motions. I guess I could try tracking when I’m most alert, but I don’t want to make promises I can’t keep.

interviewer: It sounds like taking small steps toward tracking your energy could be a helpful starting point. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to address before our next session in two weeks?

patient: Maybe just... making sure I don’t cancel on Lina this week? I’ve been relying on her too much. The coffee machine’s been acting up, so I guess fixing that could be a... a small win?

interviewer: It sounds like setting that small win with the coffee machine could give you a sense of accomplishment. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to adjust or prioritize before our next session?

patient: Maybe just... sticking to the coffee machine fix? I don’t want to overcommit, but if I can get that done without Lina having to remind me... that’d be something. It’s like... if I can stop short-circuiting on the small stuff, maybe the bigger things won’t feel so impossible. Though I’m not betting on it.

interviewer: It sounds like focusing on the coffee machine as a manageable goal could help build momentum. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to address or adjust before our next session in two weeks?

patient: Maybe... the washing machine? It's been clogged again, and I hate that Lina's fixing everything while I'm just... static. But I don't want to overthink it. If I can keep the coffee machine running without burning it out, maybe the rest will... sort itself out. Probably not, though.

interviewer: It sounds like focusing on the coffee machine and acknowledging small wins could help build momentum. Is there anything else you'd like to adjust or prioritize before our next session in two weeks?

patient: Honestly, I think I’ll stick with the coffee machine for now. If I can handle that without Lina catching me zoning out... maybe I’ll tackle the washing machine later. But only if it doesn’t turn into another ‘zombifying’ marathon. I keep worrying I’m just... delaying the real stuff.

interviewer: It sounds like focusing on the coffee machine as a manageable step aligns well with your energy patterns. Before we close, is there anything else you’d like to adjust or carry forward ahead of our next session in two weeks?

patient: The coffee machine... I’ll try not to let it feel like another chore. Just keeping it running without burning it out, you know? Maybe that’s enough for now. I’ll... see if I can avoid adding more weights to the scale.
