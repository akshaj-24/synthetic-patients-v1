system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: It sounds like you've been through a lot recently, Brian. Can you confirm if you're comfortable proceeding with our discussion today?

patient: I guess... I’ve been sleeping in the tractor shed lately, but I’ll manage. You try, you really do. We can talk if you think it’s needed.

interviewer: Thank you for being here, Brian. Today, we'll be discussing how you've been feeling and any challenges you're facing. Do you have any questions about how this will work before we start?

patient: No questions, I guess. Just... try to wrap it up by noon? The tractor’s been giving me trouble, and I don’t trust it to hold out longer. You try, you really do.

interviewer: It sounds like the tractor situation is adding to your stress. Are you okay with proceeding with our discussion today?

patient: Yeah, the tractor’s been acting up like me lately. I’ll hold out till noon if it doesn’t quit on me. You try, you really do.

interviewer: Can you tell me what's been going on for you lately that's brought you in today?

patient: The tractor’s been on the fritz, won’t start right. Sleep’s been… patchy. Got that fine for maintenance, feels like another strike against me. You try, you really do.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging to manage. When did the tractor issues and sleep difficulties first start affecting your daily routine?

patient: The tractor... it started acting up maybe six months ago. After that reprimand, I guess. Sleep's been worse since, you know? Wakes me up like the engine backfiring. The fine hit hard too, feels like another broken part I can't afford to fix. Some days I just... sit by the pond, trying to remember why I used to like fishing.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging to manage. Have you noticed other changes in your mood or emotions during this time?

patient: I guess... some days I feel like my energy's just... drained, like the tractor battery. Not really looking forward to anything, but I keep telling myself to just get through the day. The pond... it used to help, but now it's just another thing I'm not good at. You try, you really do.

interviewer: It sounds like you're putting a lot of effort into managing each day. What are your hopes or goals for coming in today?

patient: I guess... just trying to get the sleep back on track. The tractor’s a mess, but maybe if I can fix that, the days won’t feel so heavy. The pond... I keep going there, hoping something’ll click. You try, you really do.

interviewer: It sounds like the pond is a place you keep turning to for relief. Can you share what you hope to find there, or how it's been working for you so far?

patient: The pond... it's like a reset button. I sit there, watch the water, try to clear the static. Sometimes I think about Mr. Lee, my betta. His colors used to pop, but now... faded, like me. I guess I hope the water makes my head work better. But most days, I just end up feeling like I’m not solving anything. You try, you really do.

interviewer: It sounds like Mr. Lee’s fading colors mirror how you’ve been feeling about yourself lately. How has that change affected you?

patient: It’s like... the water in the pond gets murky sometimes. You stare too long, you start forgetting what clear looks like. Mr. Lee... I guess I feel responsible. Should’ve kept his tank clean, but I didn’t even remember to feed him last week. The pond’s still there, though. Maybe that’s why I keep going back. You try, you really do.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. How does the neglect of Mr. Lee connect to how you see yourself or your ability to manage daily tasks right now?

patient: I guess... Mr. Lee’s been getting less attention. The pond’s still there, but the tractor takes priority. You try, you really do. Some days, I notice his colors faded, but... the fine for the equipment is more immediate. It’s like my batteries—don’t last as long as they should.

interviewer: It sounds like your energy levels have been a struggle for some time. When did you first notice your batteries not lasting as long as they should?

patient: It started with the tractor, I guess. Six months ago it’d stall out on me, and I couldn’t keep up with the work. The boss gave me a talking-to—said I was slacking. Since then, my legs feel like they’re dragging through mud. Some days I think maybe it’s just the season changing, but… it don’t pass.

interviewer: Have you experienced similar periods of feeling down or tired in the past, where daily tasks became overwhelming like they are now?

patient: Not really, doc. I’ve always worked hard, even when tired. This time feels… heavier. Like the tractor’s rusted worse than before. You try, but the engine just won’t turn over.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. How have the tractor's issues been affecting your ability to get through your daily work tasks lately?

patient: The tractor’s like it’s got a mind of its own now. Starts maybe once every two tries, so I’m out there double-checking connections, bleeding time I don’t have. You try, you really do—sometimes I catch myself standing there waiting for it to kick over, legs aching like I’ve been plowing all day. The fine’s still on my mind more than the machine, though. At least the tractor’s predictable. Some days I think… if I can’t keep this thing running, what’s the point of keeping anything alive? But that’s just tired thoughts, right?

interviewer: That sounds like a really heavy burden to carry. Have you been having thoughts lately about not wanting to keep going, or feeling like giving up on things entirely?

patient: Some days, yeah... it feels like the tractor after a storm. You keep turning the key, hoping it kicks over. But then you remember—Mr. Lee’s still in there, even if he’s faded. You try, you really do.

interviewer: It sounds like you're putting in a lot of effort despite feeling stuck. Have you experienced other times in your life where you felt similarly overwhelmed or lost, even if it wasn't as intense as now?

patient: Not really. When the tractor acts up, you just keep it running. Mr. Lee... he used to be brighter. You try, you really do.

interviewer: It sounds like Mr. Lee’s fading colors mirror how you’re feeling lately. How has taking care of him been going these days, given everything else on your plate?

patient: Still got him in the tank. Colors... they’re not as sharp as before. Like a dimming light bulb, I guess. You try, you really do. Just harder to keep up with everything else these days.

interviewer: It sounds like the demands on you are mounting, making it even harder to keep going. Who have you been relying on for support during these tough times?

patient: My sister, maybe. She checks in sometimes... I don’t want to burden her with all this tractor stuff. You try, you really do. The fish... Mr. Lee’s still there, at least. You keep going for them, even when it’s hard.

interviewer: It sounds like those thoughts about the tractor and Mr. Lee really weigh on you. Have there been times recently when you feel unusually restless or have more energy than usual, even if it’s not lasting long?

patient: Restless? Maybe when the tractor’s sputtering, I’ll get this... twitch in my hands, like they want to fix it faster. But it burns out quick. Like trying to recharge a dead battery with a flashlight. You try, you really do.

interviewer: It sounds like that restless energy is both intense and frustrating when it fades so quickly. Have there been times when you’ve felt like things would be better if you weren’t around to deal with them?

patient: Sometimes... I guess if the tractor wasn’t my problem anymore, maybe things would run smoother. But my sister’s always saying I’m not a machine. You try, you really do. The fine’s still there, though. Feels like it’s waiting in line behind everything else.

interviewer: It sounds like you're putting a lot of effort into managing everything despite feeling overwhelmed. Have those thoughts about things being better if the tractor wasn't a problem included any desire to end your own life?

patient: I... I don’t know. Some days, the tractor feels like it’s the only thing holding me back. If it wasn’t broken, maybe the rest of it wouldn’t matter. But I’ve always had problems. You try, you really do...

interviewer: It sounds like you're putting in a lot of effort despite feeling overwhelmed. Have you ever thought about taking your own life?

patient: I don’t think about it like that. Some days, I just... feel like I’m running on empty, you know? Like a tractor with a clogged fuel line. You keep cranking, hoping it kicks over. Mr. Lee’s still alive, even if he’s not... bright anymore. You try.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot on your shoulders. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use lately, or any other substances you might be using to cope?

patient: No, not really. Just... you know, the tractor needs oil changes. I’ve been mixing up the wrong ratios sometimes. You try, you really do. Long days, but it’s just work, right?

interviewer: It sounds like the tractor’s maintenance has become a heavy burden. Have those thoughts about things being better if the tractor wasn’t a problem included a specific plan or means to harm yourself?

patient: No... no plan. Just... the tractor. If it was fixed, maybe the weight would lift. But it’s not that simple. Some days I think, if I could just get the right part, everything’d work. But I’m still here, aren’t I? You try.

interviewer: It sounds like the tractor's issues are adding to your stress without a clear solution. Have you been using any other substances, like stimulants or opioids, to cope with the fatigue or stress?

patient: No... just the tractor. Sometimes I mix up the oil ratios, but that’s it. You try, you really do. The machine’s got to keep running, right?

interviewer: It sounds like managing the tractor’s maintenance is adding to your physical and mental exhaustion. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or restless, even if it doesn’t last long?

patient: Not really. The tractor’s the only thing keeping me moving, but even it’s acting up now. You try, you really do... but the fine just adds another weight. I guess some days I feel like I’m rusting faster than I can oil the parts.

interviewer: It sounds like the tractor’s problems are adding a lot of pressure. Have you ever felt a desire or intention to end your own life, even if just in moments of feeling overwhelmed?

patient: I... don’t think about that. Not in a real way. Sometimes the pond looks still, like the water’s holding its breath. You try to focus on the tractor, the fine, anything concrete. It’s easier than... than letting your mind go there. Some mornings, I just wish I could sleep through the whole day. But Mr. Lee’s still alive, right? Even if his colors are fading. You keep going for things like that, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like the pond’s stillness is a powerful image for you. Have you ever considered the pond as a place where you might try to end your life, even if just in moments of feeling overwhelmed?

patient: The pond... it's just still, like it's holding its breath. You try to focus on the water, but my mind drifts to Mr. Lee. If he can keep going, maybe I can too. Even if his colors are fading.

interviewer: Let me recap what we've covered: You've been feeling overwhelmed and exhausted for about six months, with sleep difficulties, loss of interest in work, and stress from tractor problems and financial strain. The stress feels heavier now, with thoughts like 'if I can’t keep this thing running, what’s the point?' but you’re holding out, partly for Mr. Lee and your sister’s support. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... maybe the arguing with my sister. About money. She’s trying to help, but it feels like I’m letting her down. You try to keep up, but...

interviewer: Let me make sure I’ve captured this correctly: The stress with your sister around money feels like another weight to carry, especially when you’re already struggling to keep up with the tractor issues and sleepless nights. It sounds like her support feels both helpful and like a reminder of what you’re not managing. What did I miss?

patient: Yeah... that’s about it. The fine’s just another thing stacking up. You try to fix the tractor, but the parts are expensive... My sister offers help, but I don’t want her to see how bad it is. Mr. Lee’s still alive, though. You keep going for things like that... even if they’re fading.

interviewer: It sounds like the financial strain and your sister’s concern are adding to the weight you’re carrying, especially when you’re already managing so much. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... I took out a loan for the tractor parts. Didn’t tell my sister. She’s got enough on her plate. You try, you really do.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of pressure to manage everything on your own, even when it feels unsustainable. What did I miss about how these challenges are affecting you?

patient: The loan... it’s like adding fuel to a fire you can’t put out. Every time I think I’ll catch up, something else bleeds money—parts, the fine, even Mr. Lee’s food. I guess... it’s just making the rust spread faster. You try, you really do.

interviewer: It sounds like the loan is another layer in the pressure you're managing, especially when the ground feels unstable. What did I miss about how this is affecting you?

patient: The loan... it’s like a leaky bucket. You patch one hole and another springs up. I can’t focus on the tractor work without worrying about the numbers. Sleep’s worse—lie there counting hours instead of resting. You try, you really do.

interviewer: It sounds like the loan is adding to the weight you're carrying, especially with the sleep loss and tractor stress. What did I miss about how this is affecting you?

patient: It’s... like the loan’s a second shift I can’t clock out of. Even when I’m asleep, I’m still working it. The tractor’s not fixed, the fine’s unpaid, and now my sister’s probably wondering why I didn’t ask for help. You try, you really do.

interviewer: It sounds like the loan is compounding your stress, making it hard to rest or focus, and your sister’s concern adds to the pressure of feeling like you’re letting people down. What did I miss about how all this is shaping your days?

patient: It’s like... the loan’s a cracked pipe. You patch it, but the water keeps seeping out. Days feel longer, and I can’t shake the guilt. My sister’s calls... they’re good, but I just can’t answer sometimes. You try.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone. What did I miss about how these pressures are shaping your days?

patient: It’s... the quiet moments, I guess. Like when I’m fixing tools late at night, and the numbers in my head don’t add up. The loan—well, that’s a cracked pipe. You patch it, but the pressure... it bleeds through. My sister calls, and I just... I don’t know how to say I’m failing without making her feel it too. Some days, the pond’s stillness is the only thing that doesn’t scream at me to do better.

interviewer: That sounds really tough. Before we wrap up, can you share who you feel you can reach out to if those thoughts become more intense?

patient: If it gets... worse? My sister, I guess. But I keep thinking of that cracked pipe—water just seeps out everywhere, no matter how you patch it. Even Mr. Lee in the pond... he’s still alive, but the water’s getting cloudier. You try, you really do.

interviewer: That cracked pipe and Mr. Lee in the pond—those metaphors feel like they carry a lot of weight for you. Before we close, can you tell me if there’s anything else you’d like to clarify or prioritize as next steps for yourself?

patient: Next steps? I guess I’ll... check the oil ratio on the tractor again. Maybe that’s all it needs. The pond—Mr. Lee’s still breathing, so I’ll keep the filter running. You try, you really do. But the numbers in my head... they don’t let up. Some days, that’s enough.
