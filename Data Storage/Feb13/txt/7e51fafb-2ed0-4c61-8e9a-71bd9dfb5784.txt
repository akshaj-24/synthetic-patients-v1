system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Hello, Mr. Welch. My name is Christy Braun, and I'll be speaking with you today. To start, may I ask if you'd share your preferred name or pronouns if they're different? This helps me address you respectfully. Then I'll briefly explain how this interview works—how does that sound?

patient: Hi. I’m John Welch. You can just call me John. I guess I’m still processing how this works—I’ve been in enough meetings where people overcomplicate things, so… to be honest, I’m trying not to read too much into it. Coffee’s making my hands jittery, but that’s just me. Type-A, you know?

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty. To keep things straightforward, this interview will involve a brief discussion of your concerns and how we can support you. Would you be comfortable proceeding with that?

patient: Sure, I guess. As long as we’re clear, I’m a professional worrier—it’s my second career. But I’ll try not to overcomplicate things. My current project has me checking every detail, you know how it is when perfection’s on the line.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty. Given how much your worries are impacting your work and relationships, how comfortable are you discussing these challenges today?

patient: Comfortable enough, I guess. As long as we’re clear, I’m not here to make drama out of it. It’s just… managing the layers, you know? Work, family, the usual. My sister’s been a lifesaver, really. Keeps me from completely losing the plot. Though I still check my emails at 2 a.m. — some habits are harder to tweak than a wonky font.

interviewer: That sounds like a balancing act. Do you have any questions about how this will work before we continue?

patient: No, I think you’ve covered the basics. Just… keep it simple, right? I’ve got enough layers to resolve without adding more. But I guess that’s just me being type-A. Coffee doesn’t help either—still feeling like a human metronome, all jittery.

interviewer: Can you tell me more about the main concerns that have been troubling you lately?

patient: I guess it's just... the usual type-A stuff. You know how it is—when you're in the middle of a project, everything feels like it's layered and needs resolving. I've been up at odd hours, you know, making sure every font is perfect. My sister's been helping with Mom, but I try not to be a burden. It's just... management, right? Coffee's not helping either—I swear my hands tremble like I'm trying to sketch with a earthquake.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of layers right now—work, family, and physical symptoms. Can you help me narrow down the top one or two concerns that feel most urgent for us to address?

patient: If I had to pick, I’d say it’s the work stuff and the... family juggling act. The project’s got these endless layers—I keep thinking, *What if a typo slips through?* But my sister’s been great, really. Just makes me want to be there for her, you know? And the coffee... it’s like my hands have a life of their own. Not that I’m not used to being a human doormat. It’s just... this earthquake sketchbook thing, right? One less shaky line would be a win.

interviewer: It sounds like the combination of work pressure and family responsibilities has been really taxing. When did you first notice these worries starting to affect your daily life, and was there a specific event that made things feel more overwhelming?

patient: I guess it started simmering around six months ago when the design contract ramped up—there was this client presentation that felt like a 3D puzzle I couldn’t quite lock into place. Then Mom’s diagnosis added another... layer. I’d lie awake staring at the ceiling, wondering if I’d missed a font or a treatment window. The thing is, it’s not like there’s one ‘switch’ moment—more like a sketch that keeps redrawing itself, you know? My hands still jitter when I try to steady them on the keyboard at 2 a.m.

interviewer: It sounds like the stress from work and family has been layering up over time. What are you most hoping to achieve through coming in for support?

patient: I guess I’m hoping to... flatten some layers, if that makes sense. Like, figure out how to stop letting the coffee-jitter sketches take over. My hands still feel like they’re drawing in tremors, and I’d like to actually finish a project without 2 a.m. font-checking marathons. Also, maybe learn to ask for help without my sister having to rescue me from my own overthinking. Not that I’m not used to being a human doormat—just... maybe less crumpled this time?

interviewer: Have you experienced similar episodes of overwhelming worry or stress in the past, and if so, what helped you manage them?

patient: I’ve been here before, like when I was juggling other big projects. Usually, I just power through—work 18 hours, ignore the coffee jitters… but this time, the layers are different because of Mom. The old tricks aren’t holding the sketch together. Maybe that’s why I’m here—trying to not be a doormat for once.

interviewer: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: No, I haven’t gone that far. I guess I’m more of a professional worrier—it’s my second career. Just... trying to keep the sketch from turning into a mess, you know? Even if the canvas feels like it’s got too many layers.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight of these layers is really wearing on you. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or need less sleep, even when stressed?

patient: Unusually energetic? Not really. I guess when the deadlines are razor-thin, there’s this... forced energy, like a flickering bulb. Coffee helps, but it’s more about keeping the gears from grinding to a halt. Sleep? I’m just... negotiating with the hour counter these days. Two a.m. font checks aren’t exactly a party, but they’re my version of 'making progress.'

interviewer: I hear how the forced energy feels more like a struggle to keep up than a true high. Have you noticed yourself taking more risks lately, or feeling like you need to talk more or faster than usual?

patient: Risk-taking? Me? I’m more like a... over-engineered blueprint. Triple-checking every line weight, you know? My sister says I talk faster when I’m flustered, but I blame the coffee. It’s just... habit. My hands still jitter through those midnight font-checks, though. Even when I’m trying to slow down, the pencil’s got its own rhythm.

interviewer: I hear how the need for control feels deeply ingrained, even as it's causing strain. Have you ever experienced any unusual thoughts, like hearing voices, seeing things others don't, or believing things that seem out of step with reality?

patient: No, nothing like that. My head’s more of a... noisy studio, you know? All these layers of 'what-ifs' piling up, but they’re just my usual overthinking. My sister teases me about being a 'human spreadsheet'—everything has to add up, or I go cross-eyed. No visions, just... relentless proofreading. Even the silence feels like it’s got hidden typos waiting to trip me up.

interviewer: I hear how the constant mental activity feels exhausting, even as you try to maintain precision. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use recently, or do you rely on other substances to manage stress?

patient: Wine? Maybe a glass here and there to... loosen the pencil grip, if that makes sense. Not really a 'coping mechanism,' just... liquid punctuation after 18-hour days. My sister teases me about turning into a 'wine-stained blueprint.' But I’m more into tending the garden these days—digging my hands into soil feels like a better kind of proofreading. No typos in the dirt, right?

interviewer: It’s interesting how your focus shifted from wine to gardening—have you used cannabis or other substances besides alcohol and coffee to manage stress or sleep?

patient: No, just the wine and coffee. Though I suppose the garden’s my latest experiment in liquid punctuation... Pruning shears instead of a wine glass. Less... volatile, if you will.

interviewer: I hear how gardening has become a grounding practice for you. Have you been taking any medications or supplements regularly, either for your anxiety, sleep, or other health concerns?

patient: No medications, nothing prescribed. I tried some over-the-counter melatonin once—it’s like whispering to a hurricane, you know? My body’s too wired for that. I’m old-school: coffee in the morning, wine at night, and if that fails… I just work until the numbers on the clock finally feel like a solution. Not exactly a pharmaceutical breakthrough, but it’s what I’ve got.
