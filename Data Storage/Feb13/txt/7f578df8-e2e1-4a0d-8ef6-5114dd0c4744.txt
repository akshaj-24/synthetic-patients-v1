system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Richard. I want to make sure you're comfortable with how we proceed today—would you be okay with us discussing your concerns in more detail and exploring ways to help?

patient: Sure, I guess. Whatever helps get me back on track. To be honest, it’s just been one of those periods where things aren’t clicking, but I’m managing—work’s keeping me busy, mostly. I’ll say this: if there’s a way to stop waking up at 3 a.m. like a broken clock, I’m all ears.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty. Would you be comfortable sharing a bit more about how long you've been waking up at 3 a.m. before we continue?

patient: It’s been… I guess a couple of months now. Feels longer, but I keep telling myself it’s just my brain’s new schedule. You know how it is—when the creative well runs dry, even your sleep cycles turn into a rough draft. To be honest, I just stop myself from hitting snooze too hard. My coffee’s usually colder than I like by the time I get up.

interviewer: That sounds really tough. Would you be comfortable continuing with our discussion today?

patient: I guess so. It’s just... even when I get going, everything feels like a draft that keeps getting rewritten. But I’ll power through—my daughter’s birthday is in a few weeks, and I want to be... present for that. To be honest, I’ve been staring at my sketchbook so long it feels like a locked door. Maybe we can figure out why I can’t even redraw the same stick figure anymore?

interviewer: It sounds like the sketchbook is a big source of frustration for you. Do you have any questions about how this session will work or anything else before we proceed?

patient: No, I think you’ve got the roadmap covered. To be honest, I just hope we can… I don’t know, untangle some of the static. My brain’s like a corrupted file these days—keeps crashing when I try to open the ‘why’ folders. As long as we don’t spend too much time on the sketchbook metaphors, I’ll probably be fine. I’ve got a deadline for my daughter’s birthday, after all. Even if the stick figure’s faded, I’ll color inside the lines for now.

interviewer: Can you tell me what's been bringing you to seek help right now?

patient: I guess it’s the whole... client rejecting my work, then my manager giving that ultimatum. I mean, I’ve always had late nights, but waking up at 3 a.m. and just... staring at the ceiling? It’s not sustainable. My sketchbook’s been empty for months, and I can’t even fake-motivate myself to reorganize my desk anymore. To be honest, my wife’s been sleeping in the guest room, and I keep telling her it’s ‘just space,’ but I hate that she’s there wondering if I’ll just... vanish before the birthday party. I don’t know. It’s like my brain’s on a loop of ‘why even start?’

interviewer: That sounds really difficult, especially with your wife feeling like an outsider. How has this distance been affecting your relationship with her lately?

patient: I guess... it’s like she’s trying to open a door I’ve already locked. She’ll ask if I want to watch a movie or something, and I just say ‘later’ because the later never comes. To be honest, the only reason I haven’t canceled the birthday party is because she’d call me on it. But even then, I keep thinking she’s just... waiting for the day I won’t show up. It’s all just gray now, you know? Even the arguments feel like they’re filtered through a grayscale lens.

interviewer: That sounds really isolating... When did you first start noticing that things felt gray or like they were in a grayscale?

patient: I guess it started creeping in after the client rejected my portfolio... but honestly, it was more like a slow fade. The sleeplessness became a habit, and the colors just... dulled. I kept telling myself it was just a rough project cycle. To be honest, I still think of it like a sketch that never quite lands—you keep erasing, but the lines are already gone.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to maintain your usual productivity while feeling this emotionally drained must be incredibly overwhelming. Have you experienced episodes like this before, where you felt this down or lost your motivation?

patient: I guess... the closest was maybe a few years back when I missed a big deadline. But that was more like a one-off crash. This feels like... a stuck project? Where every day’s another roadblock. My brain’s just running on, like, dial-up these days.

interviewer: It sounds like this current experience feels more persistent and overwhelming than past challenges. When you mentioned the earlier deadline missed, was that episode similar in how it affected your motivation and energy, or was it different in key ways?

patient: I guess the past thing was more like... a power outage? You reset the circuit breaker, and lights come back on. This feels like a rewiring job that never ends. Back then, I could still fake motivation, like cranking up a speaker to drown out the noise. Now? Even the faking’s on dial-up. The 3 a.m. wakeups? They’re not a blip anymore. They’re just... there. Like a typo you can’t unsee in every sentence you read.

interviewer: It sounds like that past experience was more temporary compared to now. When you had that earlier episode after missing the deadline, what strategies or support helped you get back on track?

patient: I guess... I just forced myself to stick to a routine. You know, like, setting specific times to work on projects, even if I didn’t feel like it. To be honest, it was more about avoiding the guilt of letting people down than actually feeling better. I mean, it wasn’t like there was anything *working* there, just... kept moving until the panic about missing deadlines faded. But that’s not really applicable now, is it?

interviewer: It sounds like creating structure was a way to hold things together even when it felt unsustainable. Have you experienced other periods where you felt this same sense of being stuck or emotionally overwhelmed, outside of the deadline-related episode you mentioned?

patient: I guess... after my dad’s Parkinson’s diagnosis, I felt like a project that never got the green light. Just... stuck in limbo. But that’s not really the same as this. This is like the whole system’s on maintenance mode. Even trying to talk about it feels like digging through wet cement. My marriage’s been... quieter since then, but I don’t know if that’s relevant. To be honest, I’m just surprised my brain hasn’t downgraded to dial-up yet.

interviewer: It sounds like the strain on your marriage has become a heavy weight to carry. How has this quietness been affecting your connection with your wife lately?

patient: I guess... it’s like we’re both waiting for the other to make a move. To be honest, most nights I just... power through the silence. It’s not exactly a design flaw, but... sleeping apart feels practical. Less 'weight' on her, I guess. We talk about the kid, the bills—anything but what’s actually in the air. It’s just... static, you know? Like a low-res file that won’t sharpen.

interviewer: It sounds like the emotional distance between you and your wife adds to the strain. Have you talked to her about how you're feeling, or does it feel too difficult to bring up these topics?

patient: I guess... we orbit around the same topics, you know? The kid’s school play, the dog’s new kibble. To be honest, bringing up anything else feels like trying to compress static into a JPEG—just ends up pixelated and useless. She asks if I’m okay, and I say ‘fine,’ which is... functional, I guess. But the ‘fine’ part? That’s just placeholder text.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry in silence. Can you think of a specific moment when you felt most disconnected from her during these conversations?

patient: I guess... there was this one night after the kid’s soccer game. We were in the kitchen, and she said something about how I looked 'drained.' I just... nodded and said, 'It’s the project deadlines,' even though there were no deadlines. To be honest, it felt like trying to explain a corrupted file to someone who only knows Instagram filters. We both just... stared at the silence until the dog barked. Static again. Nothing sharpens.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to be emotionally present for your daughter’s birthday is really weighing on you. Have you had any thoughts about not wanting to live, or about ending your life, even if just in your mind?

patient: I guess... some days it feels like the default setting is 'shutdown,' but I don’t know. The birthday thing keeps me... calibrated. I mean, if I miss that, it’s not like anyone’ll notice. But no, I haven’t. Just... two glasses most nights. Helps the fog lift enough to sleep. I think.

interviewer: Using alcohol to manage sleep must be challenging. Has this amount of drinking changed over the past few months, and do you notice any effects on your mood or energy levels?

patient: It’s pretty consistent—two glasses, same as always. Helps the noise... buffer, I guess. If I skipped it, the fog just... hangs longer. But I’m functional, right? The birthday’s a deadline I can’t afford to miss. Keeps the processing running, even if it’s on low power.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness about this. Have you used any other substances, like cannabis or stimulants, in the past few months to manage your symptoms or energy levels?

patient: No, just the two glasses of wine most nights. It’s the only thing that helps the noise buffer enough to sleep. I don’t really... experiment with anything else. Keeps the processing running, even if it’s on low power.

interviewer: It sounds like the wine helps you manage some of the nighttime distress. Have you been prescribed any medications or taken any supplements recently, either for sleep, mood, or other concerns?

patient: No, nothing prescribed. I’ve avoided meds since college—too many variables. If the wine’s keeping the system from crashing, why add more code? The birthday’s my stress test. If I can make it through that, maybe the rest will... compile.

interviewer: It seems you’re managing with routines and key milestones to stay grounded. Have you experienced periods of feeling unusually energetic or in a better mood than usual, even when you didn’t sleep much?

patient: No, I’ve been pretty much on low power, like a laptop with a dying battery. The only thing keeping me charged is the birthday countdown. If that’s not enough, I don’t think there’s anything left in the buffer.

interviewer: I hear how the birthday feels like a crucial anchor for you. Have you had any thoughts about wanting to end your life, even if not in a specific way or timeframe?

patient: I guess... I don’t know how to put it. There’s this noise, you know? Like static that never goes away. The wine helps mute it, but even that feels like a placeholder. The birthday’s the only thing keeping me from... I don’t know, dissolving into the static. But I’m not stupid enough to make it final. My daughter’s drawings still have my stick figure in them. Doesn’t mean I deserve it, though.

interviewer: I hear how the noise feels overwhelming, and it’s meaningful that the birthday gives you a sense of purpose. Have you noticed any experiences where you hear voices, see things others don’t, or have thoughts that feel unusual or confusing?

patient: No, I don’t hear voices or see things. It’s more like... a constant static, like a broken radio. My thoughts just loop the same stuff—deadlines, the sketchbook, the same old stuff. Doesn’t feel unusual, just... stuck.

interviewer: Let me check if I’ve captured the key points: You’ve described a pattern of sleep disturbance, creative block, and emotional exhaustion lasting months, managed in part by alcohol but with growing concern about your ability to engage with work and family, especially ahead of your daughter’s birthday. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... the silence between me and my wife? We just... talk in these low-res fragments now. And the reorganizing—tiny wins that don’t last. But it’s hard to explain. The birthday’s the only thing that feels... in focus.

interviewer: It sounds like the strain in your marriage is adding to the weight you're carrying, especially with the birthday approaching. Would you like to explore that dynamic further, or should I summarize the key themes we've covered so far before discussing next steps?

patient: I guess the marriage... it's just static most days. We talk in these low-res fragments, like you said. The reorganizing gives a tiny win, but it's gone by morning. The birthday’s the only deadline I have left. Doesn’t mean I’m not dragging everyone down, though.

interviewer: It sounds like the marriage has become a source of static and emotional distance, with communication reduced to fragmented exchanges and the birthday acting as both a fragile anchor and a pressure point. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... the pressure of the birthday isn’t just about the day itself. It’s like this invisible checklist I can’t unsee—balloons, cake, not screwing up the photos. My wife keeps asking if I need help, but I say ‘I’ve got it’ even when I don’t. The reorganizing? It’s the only time I feel like I’m not just... static. But then the dog barks and it all melts back to grayscale. The wine helps, but I hate how it’s the only way I can stop counting all the ways I’m failing.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy mix of pressure and isolation, especially balancing the need to appear capable while feeling overwhelmed. What did I miss?

patient: I guess you didn’t miss much. The reorganizing thing—I keep fixing the desk drawers, like if I can just make that one corner *perfect*, it’ll... I don’t know, prove I’m still functional. But the wine helps more. It’s not that I *like* the taste, just... it drowns the static. What else? Oh. My dad’s Parkinson’s flares up when I miss deadlines, and I lie about it. Says ‘travel delays’ sound better than ‘my brain’s broken.’ Sounds about right.

interviewer: It sounds like your father’s Parkinson’s symptoms are entangled with your own stress cycles, adding another layer to the pressure you’re carrying. What else did I miss?

patient: The desk reorganizing—it’s just my way of pretending I can still ‘optimize’ something, you know? Like if I align these pens just right, the rest of the chaos might follow. But the wine… it’s not really about the taste. It’s more like a software update for the background noise. Oh, and my daughter’s birthday. I keep thinking about how she still draws me in the family pictures, even though I’m just a stick figure with a frowny face. Maybe she’ll finally get the hint and erase me.

interviewer: That sounds like a fragile balance between seeking control through routine and using alcohol to mute the noise. What did I miss about how these strategies fit with the rest of your experience?

patient: I guess the desk thing... it’s not just about order. It’s like my dad’s voice in my head, you know? ‘Fix the details, and maybe the big picture won’t crumble.’ But the wine? It’s more like a bandaid on a broken arm. It numbs the ‘why even?’ part long enough to fake smiling at the kid’s drawings. The birthday... it’s the only deadline I care about. If I miss that, I’m not sure there’s anything left to ‘optimize.’

interviewer: It sounds like the desk reorganizing, your dad’s voice, and the wine are all part of a pattern where you’re trying to hold things together while the rest feels like it’s falling apart. What did I miss about how these pieces fit together for you?

patient: I guess it’s like... trying to patch a leaky boat with duct tape while the ocean’s rising. The desk stuff? It’s my dad’s ‘fix the details’ mantra on repeat. The wine just... pauses the panic long enough to fake-normal for the kid’s birthday. But the duct tape’s coming loose. Every time I think I’ve stabilized something, the floorboards creak again. It’s just... not a sustainable build, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like you’re caught in a cycle where small fixes and temporary escapes keep you afloat but can’t hold back the bigger currents pulling you under. What did I miss about how these patterns connect to the pressures you’re facing?

patient: It’s like... trying to code a website with one hand tied behind my back while the browser keeps crashing. The deadlines don’t care that my brain’s buffering, and my dad’s ‘fix it faster’ voice is just another tab freezing up. The wine? It’s not a solution—it’s just enough to stop the error messages from screaming loud enough to wake the kid. But the birthday... it’s the only bookmark I haven’t deleted. Even if it’s just a placeholder, it’s the only thing that feels like a ‘save point.’ I guess.

interviewer: That sounds like a powerful mix of technical metaphors and emotional anchors—coding under constraint, your dad’s voice as a frozen tab, and the birthday as your only bookmark. What did I miss about how these elements shape your current experience?

patient: I guess what’s missing is how the birthday feels like… a deadline I can’t even fake-commit to. It’s there, but I keep convincing myself it’s just another thing I’ll screw up. My dad’s voice? It’s not the criticism anymore—it’s the silence. Like he’s gone but still in the room, making me overthink every brushstroke. And the sketchbook… I reorganize it every morning, but the pages stay blank. To be honest, the wine helps me stop counting the ways I’m failing until morning. It’s just… noise I can’t shut off.

interviewer: It sounds like the birthday is both a fragile anchor and a source of unbearable pressure, with your dad’s silent presence amplifying self-criticism, and alcohol serving as a temporary mute button for the noise. What did I miss about how these patterns connect to your energy, mood, or sense of self?

patient: I guess the energy thing… it’s like trying to draw a straight line with a shaky hand. The pressure to get it right makes everything take twice as long, but the dad part? It’s not just the criticism—it’s the quiet after. Like he’s in the room but muted, and I’m over-editing every stroke. The wine? It’s not about getting drunk. It’s just… turning off the static long enough to fake that I’m not drowning. But mornings? The fog’s still there, making me forget to eat until the dog barks at me.

interviewer: That sounds like a fragile but intentional effort to manage overwhelm through routine and temporary relief. Let me offer a brief model of what’s been going on: Longstanding pressure from work expectations and your father’s critical presence may have set the stage, with the recent client rejection and marital strain acting as triggers. The cycle of using alcohol to mute self-criticism, paired with avoiding emotional connection, seems to be keeping things stuck. What did I miss about how these pieces fit together for you?

patient: I guess… you didn’t mention how much I’m afraid of being a burden. My wife’s been trying to help, but I keep telling her I’m ‘fine’ because I don’t want to drag her down. It’s just… another loop. And work? I’m hiding my dad’s Parkinson’s from my clients, blaming travel delays for missed deadlines. The birthday thing? It’s not just pressure—it’s guilt. Like even if I show up, I’ll mess it up for her. But I can’t tell her that. I just… reorganize my desk every morning. It’s the only thing that feels like I’m doing something right.

interviewer: It sounds like the fear of being a burden and the cycle of avoidance are central to how you’re managing stress right now. What did I miss about how these dynamics shape your sense of control or connection?

patient: I guess the control part… it’s like reorganizing the desk every morning. It’s the only thing that feels like I’m not completely failing, but I know it’s just rearranging the same empty boxes. The birthday? It’s a deadline I can’t even treat like a project. I keep adding layers of contingency plans, but it all feels like… buffering. And my wife? I’d rather fake my way through small talk than admit I’m scared I’ll ruin it. To be honest, the wine helps me stop spiraling long enough to pretend I’ve got this under control.

interviewer: It sounds like the upcoming birthday is both a source of pressure and something you’re determined to be present for. How would you like to approach our next session—any specific goals or topics you’d prioritize?

patient: I guess… I’d like to talk more about the birthday, but not in a way that makes it feel like another failed project. Maybe figuring out how to stop overcomplicating it? And… the work stuff. My dad’s Parkinson’s is eating into deadlines, but I can’t tell my clients. It’s just another layer of ‘fixing’ I can’t let slip. To be honest, the desk reorganizing feels like the only thing keeping me from… buffering out completely. Maybe that’s something to unpack?
