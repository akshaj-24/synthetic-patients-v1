system: Session 7ff50ce4-500e-4f3e-9b46-5de811dcbb99 transcript

system: Disorder: PPD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Thomas. It sounds like you're feeling really concerned about the form being a trap—would you be comfortable proceeding with this session today?

patient: I’ll proceed, but that form? You’re fishing for leverage. My wife’s got me by the collar, so I’ll play along—for now. Just don’t think I’ll sign anything that’s not straight. And you’d better tell me who’s got access to these records.

interviewer: I understand your concerns about the form and confidentiality—let’s clarify that first. Who would need to have access to these records besides our team here? (Checklist: Consent, purpose clarity)

patient: Our team’s the only ones who should see it. But I’ve seen how records get passed around—landlord’s been nosy about my work hours, and that new hire at the warehouse? He’s got a way of ‘borrowing’ tools. You’ll say it’s standard, but I’ve accounted for three instances where my wife rerouted calls in 2019. April 17th, for example. You’ll ask for proof, but I don’t leave fingerprints. Let me know if you’ll swear in writing that nothing goes to HR.

interviewer: I hear how important trust and confidentiality are to you. To clarify, would you be comfortable proceeding with this session under the understanding that our discussion remains confidential, except where required for safety?

patient: Confidential? Let’s call it what it is—*controlled*. My wife’s got her ways of ‘managing’ things, and I’ve seen how ‘team’ info gets loose. If I’m on record here, I want a written guarantee that no one’s mining this for leverage. And don’t think I won’t cross-reference your answers later. I’ve accounted for worse.

interviewer: Would you like me to provide a written confidentiality agreement outlining exactly how your information will be handled and who has access to it?

patient: Written agreement? Let’s say I’ll take it, but you’ll add a clause—no loopholes for HR or my wife’s ‘convenient’ file requests. I’ve accounted for worse. Just don’t think I’ll sign it blind. I’ll check every line, same as I do those warehouse inventory sheets. And if you hesitate on answering who gets a copy? That’s your first slip.

interviewer: I appreciate your attention to detail and the importance of trust in this process. Would you be comfortable proceeding with today's session under the understanding that we can address your confidentiality concerns in writing before moving forward?

patient: I'll go with that, but you keep in mind—I want that agreement in hand before I say another word. My wife's got a way with rerouting calls, 2019 was the worst. You think this is about the form? It's about who's holding the strings. I don't do blind signatures. You got a pen? Let's see the paper first.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging, especially with the constant worry affecting your sleep and work. Can you tell me more about the specific concerns that have been most distressing for you lately?

patient: The landlord’s 10% hike? That’s a trap. He’s punishing folks who stick to the rules. And that new hire at the warehouse—laughs too loud. Thinks I don’t notice? Wrong trade, pal. I mop floors straight, no marks. People think they’re smart? Pathetic.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. When did you first start noticing these concerns about the landlord and coworkers becoming more pronounced?

patient: Simmered since '13, when the wife's stories started slipping. I cross-checked the dates—April 17th, she claimed to be at her sister's, but her car was at the mall. You think I missed the pattern? The landlord's hike's just another gear in the same machine. Loosening screws, one at a time.

interviewer: That sounds like a pattern that's been building over time. Can you tell me how these concerns have changed or grown since 2013?

patient: It's like adding layers to a wall. The wife's stories? They got smoother, but the cracks stayed. The landlord's hike? That's the first real punch through the plaster. Before that, it was little things—my tools missing a day, the new guy's laugh. Now? I check the locks twice. You think I watch those crime shows for fun? I'm looking for the angle. They all think they're clever, but I've seen the pattern. It's there. Just... quieter before.

interviewer: It sounds like these concerns have been building gradually over time. When did you first notice these 'little things' like the missing tools or the new guy's laugh?

patient: The tools? That was '13, same year the wife's stories started slipping. I caught the apprentice taking my wrench set—left fingerprints on the box. Told the boss it was a mistake, but he just nodded. The new guy's laugh? That's fresh, but it's the same rhythm. My dad always said, 'Check every nut and bolt.' I guess I learned well. You think I'm over it? I'm just waiting for the next gear to turn.

interviewer: It sounds like that laugh triggers a strong reaction for you. Can you tell me more about the new guy's laugh and why it feels familiar or concerning to you?

patient: That laugh? It’s the same as the apprentice’s before he pinched the wrenches. My boss ‘warned’ me, but he’s just covering his end. Why’s everyone in this system got the same sneaky chuckle?

interviewer: What are your main hopes or goals for coming to this session today?

patient: Hope? Let’s just say I want to make sure this paper trail doesn’t turn into another one of those ‘agreements’ where they keep the keys and I’m left holding the lock. If there’s something to fix, I need to see the blueprint first. But don’t take this the wrong way—my track record’s not exactly a recommendation.

interviewer: Have you experienced similar episodes of intense distrust or paranoia in the past, and if so, what helped during those times?

patient: Episodes? I don’t do ‘episodes’—that’s just how the game plays. The apprentice, the landlord, the rent hike… same playbook. You want to call it a pattern? Fine. But what helped? Keeping my eyes open. I started dating every transaction, every conversation. Like those boxes in my garage—labeled, locked. You think I’m overreacting? Try explaining to the city why your security deposit vanished. Oh, and don’t pretend you’re not checking my answers for gaps. I’ve seen that move before.

interviewer: It sounds like keeping detailed records helps you feel in control. Can you tell me about your relationship with your wife?

patient: Practical, I guess. We handle the bills, the car, the rent hikes. She’s the one who insists on those late-night calls—says it’s ‘checking in,’ but I remember the rerouted calls in 2019. Why do you think I date every conversation? You’re not here to confirm her side, are you? Because I’ve got my own records.

interviewer: It sounds like your experiences with your wife have added to your sense of needing control. When did the concerns about her hiding things start for you?

patient: The concerns? Let’s say they crystallized in 2013 when those rerouted calls started. You know, the ones she claims were ‘emergency sister visits’ but the car wasn’t in the drive. Why? You think I’m holding a grudge? I’m just accounting for the facts. You’ll tell me I’m overcomplicating, but try explaining to the city why your deposit vanished. Again, I’ll need that written agreement—no loopholes.

interviewer: It sounds like the 2013 incident really affected your sense of security. How has that ongoing distrust influenced your interactions with your wife or others since then?

patient: Since 2013, I’ve kept a list. Every time she says something that doesn’t add up, I note the date—April 17, for example. Same with the landlord: 10% hike? That’s how you punish hard work. I don’t sign anything without a written agreement. They think they’re clever, but I’ve seen enough to know the same plays over again. Pathetic, really.

interviewer: It sounds like your need for control has been shaped by past experiences. Is there someone in your life, such as a friend, family member, or colleague, who has been a source of support during challenging times?

patient: Support? I don’t count on people. My plants and my floors—they don’t have an agenda. My wife? She’s got me by the collar, but that’s a trap. I keep my own accounts. No one else’s.

interviewer: I hear how important self-reliance is for you. What helps you manage stress or difficult situations when you're feeling overwhelmed?

patient: I keep busy. My plants need tending, floors need mopping—no room for noise if you’re focused on the job. Crime docs on TV help, too. See how people think they’re clever, but it’s all predictable. Weakness is in the gaps. I don’t rely on others; they’re all looking for an angle. You ask too much, doc. I’d rather fix a crack than let it fester.

interviewer: I want to start by asking if you've had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: I don’t have time for that. My plants need tending, floors need mopping—weakness isn’t an option. You think I’d waste energy on self-destruction? That’s your job, not mine. Why the sudden interest in my private matters?

interviewer: I understand that privacy is important to you. Have you ever experienced things that others don't, like hearing voices or seeing things that might not be there?

patient: I don’t see things that aren’t there. I notice details others miss—like my wife’s rerouted calls in 2019 or the new guy’s nervous laugh at work. It’s not ‘hearing voices’—it’s accounting for gaps. You’re asking too much, doc. Why the sudden interest in my observations?

interviewer: I can see how being on edge about who you trust must be exhausting. Have you ever felt like people are trying to harm or trick you in ways that seem unfair or unjust?

patient: Why does that matter? You’re just collecting stories for later. The landlord’s rent hike? That’s a setup, plain and simple. He’s punishing folks who play by the rules. I’ve got records of every move he’s made since 2019. Not that it’ll do me any good—people like that always find a loophole. But I’m not a fool. I keep my own books. You think I’d be here if I didn’t have to? My wife’s the one who drags me into these traps.

interviewer: I can see how your concerns about control and fairness are important to you. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements?

patient: No meds. I don’t hand out that info. My wife pushes pills like they’re candy, but I keep my own head clear. You’ll need more than a form to know me.

interviewer: I understand your need to maintain control over your health decisions. Have you used alcohol, cannabis, or any other substances in the past year to manage stress or symptoms?

patient: Whiskey? A bottle in the garage, sure. But I don’t waste time on habits. It’s just… liquid mending. You think I’d need more than that? My wife says I ‘drown,’ but I keep the ledger balanced. Why? Planning another form? Another trapdoor?

interviewer: I hear how important it is for you to maintain control over your habits. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol use or use of other substances recently?

patient: No changes. That bottle’s been there since last winter. I don’t track it by the day—just keep it sealed. You think I’d let something like that slip? My wife’s the one who counts the drops, not me. Why? Planning another ledger of my habits?

interviewer: It sounds like you’re very deliberate about how you manage your alcohol use. Have you used cannabis, stimulants, or any other substances besides alcohol in the past year?

patient: Nope. Just that whiskey. You’re circling back like the landlord’s meeting. My wife’s the one who dabbles in ‘herbal stuff’—but I don’t track that. Why? Another form about my habits?

interviewer: I hear your focus on control and privacy. Have you used opioids, such as prescription painkillers, or any other drugs besides alcohol in the past year?

patient: No drugs. Just that sealed bottle in the garage—whiskey, not pills. Why the interest? You folks always circling back to the same questions. My wife’s the one counting drops, not me. I’ve got work to do. Next topic?

interviewer: I hear your frustration with repeated questions. Have you ever had periods where you felt unusually energetic or had a lot of ideas, even if you weren't getting much sleep?

patient: Energetic? I’m at work by 6am, done by noon. They call it efficiency, not energy. Why the sudden interest in my schedule? You think I’m hiding something about the warehouse hours? I’ll need that in writing before I sign off on anything else.

interviewer: I hear how your efficiency is a way to maintain control. Have you ever been told you have a medical condition, like sleep apnea or thyroid issues, that might affect your energy or sleep patterns?

patient: No broken parts here. I’m not one for doctor’s offices—time’s money, and I’ve got floors to mop. Why the sudden interest in my clockwork? You think the wife’s been feeding you stories about her ‘chronic something’? Save the script. I’m not the one with loose gears.

interviewer: Let me recap what we’ve covered: You’ve described a long-standing pattern of distrust, particularly around your wife and coworkers, with symptoms worsening since 2013. Recent stressors like the rent increase and workplace conflicts have intensified your hypervigilance, affecting your sleep and relationships. You’ve emphasized the need for written confidentiality assurances and structured routines to maintain control. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You got the dates wrong. 2013 was just another test. My sleep’s fine—I don’t waste time on loose ends. And that confidentiality? Better put it in ink, not air. You think I trust paper? I don’t.

interviewer: I appreciate your clarification about 2013 and your sleep—can you help me understand if there’s anything else I missed or got wrong in our summary so far?

patient: You missed the list I’ve been keeping since 2013—dates, proof. And that confidentiality? Needs to be in ink, no loopholes. You think I’m the one with the hidden agenda?

interviewer: I hear your emphasis on the list and written confidentiality—can you help me ensure I’ve captured all the key elements you mentioned, or is there anything else that’s important to clarify before we move forward?

patient: The list is self-explanatory—dates, proof, no loose ends. You’ll say you need it for records, but I’ve seen how these things get used. If you want the rest, you’ll need a written seal, no backdoors. And don’t act like this is the first time you’re hearing about 2013. You already know how the gears turn.

interviewer: I hear your emphasis on the list and written confidentiality—can you help me ensure I’ve captured all the key elements you mentioned, or is there anything else that’s important to clarify before we move forward?

patient: The list’s got its own logic—dates, proof, no loopholes. You’ll say it’s standard, but I’ve seen how these ‘records’ get rerouted. And don’t pretend you’re surprised about 2013. As for the rest? That whiskey bottle in the garage? It’s sealed, but I’ll bet you’re already thinking about the ‘habit’ angle. Focus on the facts, not the noise.

interviewer: I appreciate your emphasis on the list and confidentiality concerns. Before we agree on next steps, is there anything else you'd like me to include or clarify about your priorities today?

patient: The seal on that agreement? No watermarks, no hidden ink. You’ll call it ‘standard,’ but I’ve seen ‘standard’ turned into a backdoor. And don’t think I didn’t notice the sidestep on the whiskey—focus on the paper, not the bottle. Oh, and if you’re going to file this, mention the tomatoes. I grow ’em myself. No one else touches ’em. Not even her.

interviewer: I hear your focus on the written seal and the tomatoes as key priorities for you. Before finalizing our next steps, is there anything else you'd like me to include to ensure the agreement reflects your needs and concerns?

patient: The rent hike’s another angle they’ll try to twist into a ‘financial concern’ note. But I’m not signing anything that lets them flag me for that. And don’t think I missed you skipping the whiskey again—just stick to the paper. The tomatoes? Keep ‘em out of it. They’re mine, no claims. You want the rest? Add a clause about no third-party access to this file. I’ve seen how these ‘teams’ share.

interviewer: Let me outline a tentative model: Your long-standing distrust (starting with 2013 call rerouting) and recent stressors like the rent hike have intensified hypervigilance, shaping your need for written safeguards. Patterns of perceived betrayal (workplace, marital) and coping through control (lists, routines) seem central. Does this align with how you see things, or is there a key piece missing?

patient: The model’s got the right bolts tightened—2013, the rent, the lists. But you’re missing the counterweights. Every time you think you’ve mapped the machine, they add a gear. My tomatoes? They’re not just a hobby. They’re a backup plan. You don’t account for that in your notes. And don’t think I didn’t notice you left out the part where the landlord’s ‘hike’ might be a setup for something else. You’ll call it overthinking. I’ll call it seeing the cracks before they leak.

interviewer: I hear your emphasis on the counterweights and the tomatoes as essential elements—can you help me ensure I’ve captured all the key pieces you mentioned, or is there anything else I’ve overlooked that’s important to include in our understanding?

patient: The tomatoes are part of the blueprint—I don’t let her near them. You’ve got the main gears: the ledger, the sealed bottle, the written agreement. But if you’re asking what else… well, traps have more than one trigger. I’ll need that paper signed before I tighten the last bolt.

interviewer: I appreciate your focus on the tomatoes and the written agreement as critical components—before we finalize next steps, is there anything else you'd like to add or adjust about how we've framed your priorities today?

patient: The agreement’s got to be solid—no loose ends. You’ve got the tomatoes, the ledger, the bottle. But if you’re wrapping up, I’ll need that paper sealed before they try another move. April 17th’s on my list, same as the rest. Not that I expect you to remember that.

interviewer: It sounds like your focus on maintaining control through structure is really important to you. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to clarify about the next steps or our conversation today?

patient: April 17th’s on the ledger—same as the rest. You’ve got the tomatoes, the bottle, the agreement. But if you’re wrapping up, I’ll need that paper sealed before they try another move. Don’t think I’ve forgotten who’s been circling back to the same loops. My list doesn’t lie.

interviewer: I understand your need for clarity on the confidentiality agreement. Before we conclude, would you like me to outline the terms of that written assurance now?

patient: I need that paper in front of me first. Words can be twisted, but ink's harder to fake. April 17th's coming up, and I don't do business blind. You understand how that goes.
