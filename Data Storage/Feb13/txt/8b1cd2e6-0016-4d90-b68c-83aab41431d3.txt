system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Thomas. It sounds like this has been a really challenging time for you. Would you be comfortable with me asking some questions to better understand what you're going through?

patient: Yeah, sure. I mean, if it helps, I ain’t got nothing better to do than sit here. Just don’t ask about the sleep—my tractor’s got more energy than me these days.

interviewer: That sounds okay. Just to clarify, you understand that this interview is to better understand your current experiences and needs, and it should take about 30 to 45 minutes. Does that sound okay with you?

patient: Yeah, that’s fine. Thirty minutes is about how long it takes me to nap these days, anyway. Just don’t get too bored—my life’s about as exciting as watching paint dry.

interviewer: That sounds okay. Do you have any questions for me before we start?

patient: No, ma’am. You got all the questions. Just don’t expect me to entertain you—I’m about as lively as a rusted hinge.

interviewer: It sounds like these feelings have been really overwhelming for you—can you tell me a bit about when you first started noticing these symptoms and how they've changed over time?

patient: Six months ago, things just... started feeling heavier, like tryin’ to plow through concrete. The drought hit the farm, and my wife’s pregnancy meant more bills. I told myself to work harder, but then I’d lie awake at 3 a.m. stewin’ over every mistake I ever made. At first, I thought it was just exhaustion—till I snapped at the guy at the supply store over a faulty hose and realized I hadn’t laughed at a joke in weeks. It’s... it’s like my engine sputtered out, y’know? But I’m used to fixin’ broken things. This just takes longer, I guess.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone. You mentioned snapping at your wife and others lately—can you tell me how these outbursts have affected your relationship with her or others close to you?

patient: Well, when you're run down and snapping at everything, even the cat, it's gotta leave marks. Me and Mary... we used to laugh about the silly stuff, now it's just her laughing, I'm too worn out to join in. She says I'm like that old tractor—rude when it's stuck, but polite when it's rolling. Truth is, I worry she's tired of my cranky old self. But we still have our walks, our meals... keeps things from... you know, falling apart completely.

interviewer: It sounds like you're worried about how your changes might be affecting your relationship with Mary. What are you hoping to achieve by coming in for help today?

patient: Ain't looking for no magic fix or nothing. Just... want to stop being such a grump that drives folks away. Mary’s carrying enough on her shoulders without me adding to it. If I can sleep past 3 a.m. once in a while, maybe I won’t snap at her over the coffee going cold. Keeps the tractor oiled, so to speak. Don’t need no mechanic for the whole engine—just a few loose bolts tightened up.

interviewer: It sounds like this has been a challenging time for you. Have you experienced similar episodes of low mood or changes in energy in the past, or is this the first time you've gone through something like this?

patient: No, this is the first time I've felt like this. Before, I just pushed through the tough patches. But this time, it's different. Like the tractor stuck in a rut—no matter how hard you push, you ain't getting out without a lift. Mary's been holding things together, and I don't want to drag her down further.

interviewer: It sounds like your wife, Mary, has been a key source of support for you. How has she been helping you manage things during this time?

patient: She’s been... keeping the lights on, I guess. Makes sure I eat, even if I’m too tired to cook. We still take our walks, though I’m sure she’s thinking of ways to bolt herself to the porch to avoid me when I’m cranky. Laughs at my jokes even when they’re about as funny as a broken wheel on a wagon. But I worry she’s humoring me, y’know? Like she’s waiting for me to snap back into gear. Meanwhile, I’m just... stuck in low gear, churning the same dirt.

interviewer: It sounds like you're worried Mary might be humoring you. Have you talked to her about how you're feeling or your concerns about being a burden?

patient: Ain't really laid it all out for her, no. She’s got enough on her plate with the preggy teas and the garden, so I just say I’m ‘wearin’ thin’ like a plow blade. Last time I tried to hint at it, she said, ‘You’ll oil up when the rain comes.’ But that’s the thing—what if the rain don’t come? What if I’m just... stuck in the dry dirt?

interviewer: It sounds like you're really worried about not being able to communicate your needs to Mary. Have you experienced any difficult or traumatic events in the past that might be affecting how you're feeling now?

patient: Traumatic? Nah, just... long days, I guess. Farming’s like that—rain or no rain, you keep plowin’. My dad had a temper, but that’s just how he was. Guess I’m just gettin’ old in the head, y’know? Mary’d laugh at me callin’ it trauma. She says I talk too much about nothing.

interviewer: It sounds like your father's temper was something you had to navigate early on. How do you think that shaped how you handle stress or conflict in your own life now?

patient: Dad was a hard man, but you learn to keep things under the plow where it counts. These days, I just focus on what I can control—like gettin' the crops in before the dry spell cracks the ground. Mary says I take stress like a bull in a barn, but what can ya do? Farming's taught me to weather the storm, even if the rain never comes.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed right now. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life?

patient: Look, I’m not the type to go makin’ grand gestures or nothin’. If I’m bein’ honest? Some days feelin’ like a dead engine just sittin’ in a ditch... it’s hard not to wonder if the rain’ll ever come. But Mary’s got her hands full enough without me addin’ to it. Let’s talk about that storm forecast—they say the clouds might finally break this week. Dad always said a man’s no good if he don’t keep his head above water, even if the ground’s dry as a bone.

interviewer: That metaphor about the storm is powerful. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself, even if you don't plan to act on them?

patient: Ain’t nothin’ specific, just... thinkin’ how sometimes the ground’s so dry, even the roots give up. You don’t plan for the rain, but you start wonderin’ why you should dig deeper. Mary’s always sayin’ patience, but the tractor’s actin’ up again. Maybe I’ll check the fuel lines after this. Keeps a man busy, y’know?

interviewer: Have you had any periods where you felt much more energetic than usual or needed less sleep?

patient: Nope, ain't had no energy bursts. Just been tryin' to keep the tractor movin' even when the engine's sputterin'. Sleep? I'd take a nap if the ground didn't need plowin'. Mary says I look like a man waitin' for the rain to wake up. Truth is, I'm just tired of bein' tired. Got a feeling if I close my eyes too long, the whole farm'll collapse.

interviewer: I hear how exhausting this has been for you. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or drug use lately, either to cope with the fatigue or for any other reason?

patient: Nah, ain't touched a drop. Never really been my thing—always figured that's for folks who give up, and I'm still out here plowin' through. Though I might need a coffee IV drip, if you can believe that.

interviewer: It sounds like you're managing without substances, which is a strength. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements for your symptoms, or have you tried any in the past?

patient: No, ain't on no meds. Docs have offered stuff before, but I always figured I could outwork the problem. Though my body’s arguin’ otherwise these days—my coffee habit’s doubled, but it’s like pourin’ water on a tractor battery. Dead weight, no spark.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about managing without medications. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or having strong beliefs that feel unusual, even if they seem logical to you?

patient: No, ain't no voices or nuthin' like that. My head's more like... a clogged irrigation line. Same thoughts just... drippin' in circles. 3 a.m. mind games, y'know? Wonderin' if the ground'll ever drink right again. But that's just me bein' a stubborn old farmer, not seein' no ghosts or nothin'.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now, and I appreciate you sharing these thoughts with me. Before we wrap up, can you tell me if there's anything specific about our discussion today that you'd like to revisit or clarify?

patient: Ain't much to go over, really. I think the coffee IV idea might be worth revisitin’—if you can hook me up, I’d sign right there. Other than that, just... keepin’ the ditch diggin’ to a minimum, y’know? The supply store incident’s still on my mind, but maybe that’s just me bein’ a stubborn old man who can’t let go of a bad day.

interviewer: That sounds like it’s still on your mind—would you like to talk more about the supply store incident before we wrap up?

patient: Ain't much to it, really. Just... snapped over a damn hose. Acted like I was the first man who ever seen water. Guy behind me in line was askin’ about irrigation, and I lost it ‘bout the price. Shoulda just kept my mouth shut. Mary still brings it up sometimes—says I looked like a busted tractor, all steam and no power. Guess that’s the closest I get to a punchline these days.

interviewer: It sounds like that incident still carries weight for you, even with the humor. Before we close, is there anything else you'd like to address today that could help us move forward?

patient: Nah, I think we’ve got the gist. It’s just the same old groundhog day stuff. Mary’s been growin’ these herbs like they’re keepin’ her hopes alive or somethin’. I tell her it’s just plants, but... well, maybe they’re better at takin’ root than me.

interviewer: Before we wrap up, let's discuss next steps. Would a follow-up in two weeks be a good plan to check on your progress?

patient: Yeah, two weeks sounds right. If the rain holds off that long... (pauses, then softens) Mary’s thyme’s comin’ along, though. Maybe I’ll finally learn somethin’ from it. Don’t want to waste no more time, y’know?
