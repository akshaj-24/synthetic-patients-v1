system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing this with me. Are you comfortable continuing with our session today?

patient: I guess. Might as well—I’ve got the day off work anyway. It’s just… this heat’s making my head throb, you know? Can we keep it short?

interviewer: I can keep things brief. Before we start, would you like me to explain the general approach for today's session?

patient: I guess just... stick to the basics. No point in beating around the bush. I’ve got a list of things to do after this, and I’m already running behind. The water heater’s acting up again, so I’ve got to wait for the repair guy. If we’re doin’ this, let’s keep it straight. No fancy talk, just... figure out what’s fixable.

interviewer: Do you have any questions before we begin?

patient: Nope. Just... don’t waste time. I’ve got a window between the repairman and my next errand. If we’re doin’ this, let’s not play games. You got a plan or just gonna chat?

interviewer: I understand you’d like to make the most of your time today. Do you understand that our session will focus on understanding your current concerns and how we might move forward?

patient: As long as we’re not wastin’ time. I’ve got a repairman comin’, so if we’re talkin’, let’s talk about what’s broken and how to fix it. Not just... sit here and circle the same old stuff.

interviewer: Can you tell me what's been the main concern for you lately?

patient: The water heater’s broken, and the landlord’s doing nothing. It’s been weeks. I’m hot, I can’t sleep, and... to be honest, I don’t even care anymore. Everything just feels like too much.

interviewer: That sounds really frustrating. When did the water heater issue first start, and has there been a specific change recently that made things worse?

patient: It’s been like this for weeks, maybe a month. He keeps saying he’ll get to it but never does. What’s the point? Nothing changes anyway.

interviewer: That sounds like it's adding a lot of stress. How has the broken water heater been affecting your daily routine or other aspects of your life?

patient: I can’t even take a proper shower. Had to start using cold water, which messes up my back. Can’t make hot meals anymore—just cold cereal or nothing. It’s stupid, right? But it adds up. I just... it’s like everything else matters less now. The heat’s been making me short-tempered, though. Mark says I’m snapping at nothing. But what’s the point? The guy’s a waste of time anyway.

interviewer: It sounds like the frustration is really getting to you. How have you been feeling emotionally most days lately—like, what’s the usual mood you wake up with?

patient: I wake up feeling... like a light that’s been left on too long. Drained. Empty. But it’s the heat, you know? Makes everything worse. I don’t even care about the stupid water heater anymore. Just... nothing feels worth the effort.

interviewer: That sounds really exhausting... When did you first start feeling this way—drained and empty in the mornings?

patient: Hard to pinpoint exactly. Maybe a few months? It just... crept up. Started with the water heater, I guess. Then the heat. Sleep’s been messed up—wake up at 3 a.m. and can’t go back. But what’s the point in tracking it? Everything’s a blur anyway.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry... What are you hoping to achieve or change through coming to see someone?

patient: I don’t know. I guess I just want things to stop falling apart. The heat’s killing me, and I’m tired of waiting for that repairman. If talking to someone can help me figure out how to fix the damn water heater, then sure—worth a try. But I’m not here for small talk about my head. I need solutions, not more questions.

interviewer: Have you experienced episodes like this before, where you felt this down or lost interest in things?

patient: Not really. I mean, life’s always got its ups and downs. But this time feels… heavier. The heat, the landlord dragging his feet—it’s just piling on. I don’t know if it’s ‘episodes’ or just everything going sideways at once.

interviewer: I can see how overwhelming this must feel. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life or harming yourself in the past week?

patient: I guess... I’ve been thinking a lot about how things just don’t get fixed. Like that light bulb in the kitchen—I keep replacing it, but the socket’s messed up. You keep throwing money at it, but it’s never enough. The heat’s making me snap at Mark, and I don’t even care anymore. But I’m not some dramatic mess. Just tired of everything falling apart.

interviewer: It sounds like these ongoing issues are really wearing on you. Have you been using alcohol or cannabis to cope with the stress recently?

patient: A glass of wine now and then? Sure. Keeps the noise down, you know? Not like I’m drinking myself into a coma or anything. It’s just… easier to unwind that way. The heat makes everything worse, so I guess that’s part of it. But I’m not some addict. It’s temporary until this damn water heater gets fixed and things settle down.

interviewer: I hear how the heat and stress are influencing your coping. Have you used any other substances like cannabis, prescription medications, or stimulants recently to manage these challenges?

patient: Nah. Just the wine. Nothing else. You can’t fix a leak with a Band-Aid, though. Sometimes you need to just... tackle it head-on. Like that damn water heater.

interviewer: It sounds like you're focusing on practical solutions right now. Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins on a regular basis?

patient: No meds. Just... wine. You know, to unwind. Mark says I drink too much, but it’s not like I’m blacking out or anything. The heat’s making everything worse, though. That damn water heater—landlord still hasn’t fixed it. What’s the point of even trying when nothing gets fixed?

interviewer: It sounds like the heat and unresolved repairs are compounding your stress. Have you been feeling more energetic or having a lot of ideas lately that you can’t slow down?

patient: Energetic? No. I feel like I’m running on fumes, you know? The heat’s got me waking up drenched every night, and by morning I’m too drained to even make coffee. Ideas? What ideas are there when you’re stuck waiting for someone to fix a damn water heater? Mark says I’m stuck in my head, but what’s the point of thinking when nothing changes? I just... get by.

interviewer: It sounds like the heat and lack of sleep are really affecting your energy. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or need less sleep than usual?

patient: Nope. Just... not happening. The heat’s like a weight on my chest. I don’t even have the energy to fake it anymore. Mark says I’m ‘winding down,’ but what’s the point when the damn water heater’s still broken? I just burn out faster these days, is all.

interviewer: It sounds like the heat and stress are really taking a toll. Have you experienced any periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed much less sleep than usual recently?

patient: Nope. Just... not happening. The heat’s got me up all night, drenched and restless. Morning? I’m too wiped to even make coffee. Mark says I’m ‘winding down,’ but what’s the point when the damn water heater’s still broken? I just... get by.

interviewer: It sounds like the stress is affecting your mood. Have you felt more irritable or had racing thoughts that are hard to slow down lately?

patient: I guess I snap at nothing these days. The heat’s like a fuse waiting to blow—small stuff sets me off, you know? But racing thoughts? No. My brain’s more like a stuck record, just looping the same crap. Mark says I’m ‘on edge,’ but what’s the point when the damn water heater’s still broken and I’m too tired to even argue?

interviewer: From what you've shared, it sounds like your depressive symptoms—like losing interest in activities, trouble sleeping, and feeling overwhelmed—have been slowly building over months, especially with the stress of the broken water heater and heat. These challenges seem to be making it harder to take care of yourself and connect with others, even though you're trying to stay practical and solve problems. What did I miss?

patient: You didn’t miss much. It’s all the same stuff. The water heater’s still broken, and I’m just... I don’t know. Tired of feeling like I’m not getting anywhere. Mark says I need to ‘take a break,’ but what’s the point? The landlord’s still ignoring me, and the heat’s driving me nuts. I guess that’s just how it is.

interviewer: That sounds really frustrating to feel stuck with the water heater and the heat. What would you like to focus on in our next steps?

patient: The water heater’s still broken. The heat’s making me feel like I’m gonna crack. What’s the point in talking about it? Maybe we could just... I don’t know. Move on to something else.

interviewer: It sounds like the heat and unresolved repairs are amplifying your frustration and exhaustion, making it hard to see a way forward. What did I miss about how these stressors are affecting you?

patient: The heat’s been eatin’ at me worse than I let on. I can’t sleep, just lie there listenin’ to the pipes rattle like they’re laughin’ at me. Mark says I’m too tense, but what’s the point in gettin’ worked up over somethin’ no one’s fixin’?

interviewer: It sounds like the heat and unresolved issues are really amplifying your frustration and making it hard to sleep or feel hopeful. What would you like to focus on as we move forward?

patient: I guess... I don’t even know where to start. The heat’s still here, the pipes still rattle, and Mark keeps saying I need to ‘take a break’ like that’s some kind of fix. Maybe if I could just get the damn water heater fixed, I’d stop... I don’t know. Snapping at everything. But what’s the point in talking about it? It’s not like anyone’s gonna listen.

interviewer: It sounds like the heat and unresolved issues are really amplifying your frustration and making it hard to feel hopeful. What would you like to focus on as we move forward?

patient: I don’t even know. The water heater’s still broken, and the landlord’s still ignoring me. The heat’s in my head, you know? I just... I pour a glass of wine and wait for it to cool down. But it never does. It’s like being stuck in a sauna with a leaky roof. Maybe if I could just sleep through the night without the pipes rattling... but what’s the point? It’s not like anyone’s gonna fix any of it.

interviewer: It sounds like the heat and unresolved repairs are intensifying your frustration, disrupting your sleep, and making everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You’ve also mentioned feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy and struggling with hopelessness about fixing these issues. What did I miss?

patient: You didn’t miss the part where I feel like I’m slowly unraveling, but what’s the point of saying it? The heat’s still in my head, the water heater’s still broken, and the wine’s the only thing that quiets the noise. Mark says he’s trying to help, but it just feels like he’s waiting for me to fall apart. I guess... I guess I’m scared that if I admit how bad it is, he’ll realize I’m a waste of good air.

interviewer: It sounds like your stressors are deeply intertwined with your emotional state, and you’re carrying a lot of fear about being a burden. What would you like to prioritize in terms of next steps for care—whether that’s exploring therapy, discussing possible support strategies, or something else?

patient: Prioritize? I guess fixing the water heater would be a start. It’s not like therapy’s gonna magic up the money for a new one. Mark keeps pushing these ‘next steps’ like I’m just lazy, but I’m the one keeping the lights on while he’s at work. Maybe… maybe if the damn pipes stopped groaning every time I turn on the sink, I could actually think straight. But don’t get me wrong—I’m not some broken thing that needs fixing. Just… stuck, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like your frustration with the heat and unresolved repairs is deeply tied to feelings of being overwhelmed and undervalued, especially in contrast to Mark’s suggestions. What did I miss about how these stressors are shaping your sense of self or your relationship with him?

patient: You missed how I’m just... broken, like the water heater. Keep pretending I’m fixable while the pipes scream. Mark says he’s trying to help, but every ‘solution’ feels like he’s scraping rust off a graveyard headstone. I’m not worth the effort, but I’ll keep dripping until the floor caves in.

interviewer: It sounds like your sense of being 'broken' and the strain in your relationship with Mark are central to how these stressors are affecting you. What did I miss about how this is shaping your daily life or relationships?

patient: Every time I try to fix the damn water heater, it’s like digging a hole. Mark keeps throwing wrenches at the problem, but all I need is a shovel… or a match. Doesn’t matter. The pipes keep screaming. I snap at him when he offers help, then feel like I bit off my own tongue. The wine’s the only thing that numbs the noise—his sighs, my own snapping. But tomorrow, the sink’s still frozen, and I have to pretend I didn’t take another hit from his savings to pay the electric bill. It’s not that I don’t care. I just… don’t care anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like the metaphor of the broken water heater captures both your physical stressors and the emotional weight you’re carrying, especially around feeling unseen or undervalued in your relationship with Mark. What did I miss about how these themes are shaping your sense of hope or connection right now?

patient: Hope’s been running cold since the pipes gave out. Mark keeps tightening bolts, but the leaks find new cracks. The wine’s the only thing that stops the dripping in my head... but the sink’s still frozen, and I’m still taking hits from his savings to keep the lights on. Doesn’t matter. The floor’s gonna cave in eventually. Maybe the true crime shows are the only thing that makes the noise bearable. They don’t ask me to fix anything. Just... watch.

interviewer: It sounds like your sense of being 'broken' mirrors the unresolved water heater, with Mark’s efforts feeling like temporary fixes that leave you exhausted and isolated. The wine numbs the noise, but the underlying stressors—heat, financial strain, and feeling undervalued—keep amplifying your hopelessness. What did I miss about how these themes are shaping your daily life or relationships?

patient: The heat’s been worse this week. I can’t sleep, so I just sit up all night sipping wine until the pipes start groaning like they’re laughing at me. Mark keeps fixing the sink or something, but it’s all just… bandaids. Last week I took money from his savings jar again. I told myself I’d pay it back when the heater’s fixed, but what if I never get around to it? What if I just… let the whole damn place crumble?

interviewer: It sounds like the heat is intensifying your sleeplessness and emotional strain, with cycles of taking from Mark’s savings and using wine to cope, while fearing things will collapse. What did I miss?

patient: The heat’s been worse this week. I can’t sleep, so I just sit up all night sipping wine until the pipes start groaning like they’re laughing at me. Mark keeps fixing the sink or something, but it’s all just… bandaids. Last week I took money from his savings jar again. I told myself I’d pay it back when the heater’s fixed, but what if I never get around to it? What if I just… let the whole damn place crumble?

interviewer: It sounds like the heat and unresolved repairs are intensifying your sleeplessness and emotional strain, with cycles of using wine and taking from Mark’s savings while fearing things will collapse. What would you like to prioritize for next steps—exploring practical solutions for the water heater, discussing support strategies, or something else?

patient: The heat’s the only thing I can focus on right now. It’s like the whole apartment’s a pressure cooker. But what’s the point? Even if we fix the heater, what if Mark finds out about the money? He’d just… leave. I’d rather he did. Less noise that way.

interviewer: It sounds like the heat’s unbearable intensity is making it hard to sleep or think clearly, and the fear of Mark discovering the money adds to your sense of being trapped. What did I miss about how these stressors are shaping your sense of control or connection right now?

patient: Control? I don’t got none. The heat’s like a pressure valve stuck open—boom, everything’s just… boiling. Mark tinkers with the sink, but the pipes are rusted through. I take what I need from his jar, tell myself it’s temporary. The wine helps me sleep, but it’s not like I’m out living it up. It’s just… quieter that way. Even the silence in here feels heavier than the noise.

interviewer: It sounds like the feeling of being out of control is making everything feel chaotic and unbearable. What would you like to prioritize for next steps—exploring therapy, discussing practical support, or something else?

patient: I don’t know. Fixing the heater’s the only thing that makes sense, but what’s the point? Mark’ll just find out about the money eventually. Might as well let the whole place go.
