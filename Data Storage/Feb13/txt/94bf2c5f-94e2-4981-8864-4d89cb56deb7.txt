system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for coming in, Janet. I'm here to support you. Can you confirm if you're comfortable with me using 'Janet' and any specific pronouns I should use?

patient: Yeah, Janet’s fine. Everyone at work just calls me Janet. Pronouns? I guess it’s the usual—no one’s ever had a problem with it. Keeps things simple, right?

interviewer: I want to make sure you're comfortable with how we proceed. Today, I'll be asking some questions to understand what's been going on for you, and we can take things at your pace. Would you be okay with starting that now?

patient: Yeah, sure. Might as well. Been through worse, I guess. Feels like my battery’s been drained for months, but I’ll power through. Coffee helps, most of the time.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging. Do you have any questions about what we’ll be discussing today before we move forward?

patient: No, I guess not. Just... hoping we can get through this without too much trouble. My coffee's keeping me going for now. As long as I don't have to fix anything else today, I'll call it a win.

interviewer: That sounds really overwhelming. Can you help me understand what’s been most difficult for you in the past few months?

patient: It’s hard to pin down one thing, really. Work’s been... I don’t know, heavier lately. Boss gives me more shifts, but my hands shake so bad from the coffee I need to function. Landlord raised the rent, so I guess I just keep telling myself it’s part of getting older—things costing more, your body not keeping up. Oh, and there’s this neighbor who plays music all night. You just learn to ignore the noise, I suppose.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of stressors lately. When did you first start noticing these difficulties impacting your daily life?

patient: It’s been...渐进的, I guess. Maybe around the time things got hectic with the landlord raising rent and picking up extra shifts. My head’s been foggy, and my hands still shake from all the coffee I’m chugging to keep up. But you just learn to ignore it, right? Priorities, I suppose.

interviewer: It sounds like the combination of work demands and financial stress has been taking a toll on your energy and focus. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you say part of you feels 'shut off'?

patient: Feels like my brain’s on a slow setting, y’know? Like I’m trying to turn a wrench with one hand tied behind my back. Most days, I just... go through the motions. The coffee helps a little, but it’s like trying to chase a shadow. Work keeps me busy enough, I guess. The landlord’s headaches don’t help, but what’s the point in stressing over things I can’t control?

interviewer: It sounds like the 'shut off' feeling is really affecting your ability to engage with even basic tasks. Can you help me understand when you first noticed this sense of disconnection starting?

patient: Honestly? It crept up like a leaky pipe you don’t notice till the ceiling’s got that telltale stain. Maybe three, four months back? I just started... going through the motions, like my body’s on a timer. Even fixing a sink feels like I’m watching myself do it, y’know? But what’s new? Life’s a series of bandages, right?

interviewer: It sounds like this has been building up for several months. What are you most hoping to work on or achieve through this therapy?

patient: Honestly? I just want to stop feeling like my battery’s been dead for months. Maybe get back to where I can handle the workload without my hands shaking from the coffee. Small fixes, you know? Keep the systems running without falling apart.

interviewer: It sounds like this has been a really challenging time for you. Have you experienced similar episodes of feeling overwhelmed or disconnected in the past?

patient: Not really. I’ve had busy stretches before—like when the HVAC job back in ’18 ran overtime during monsoon season. But this? Feels different. Back then, I just burned out and took a week off. Now… it’s like the battery’s dead, but I’m still plugged in. The coffee’s not even sparking anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like this current experience is more persistent and different from past burnout. Have you had other episodes where you felt this kind of exhaustion or disconnection before?

patient: I guess in 2018 I burned out after working double shifts for months—felt like a dead battery, you know? But this? It’s more like... the leak in my apartment. You don’t notice it at first, but the ceiling keeps getting darker. This time, even when I take a break, the fog doesn’t lift. Work used to reset me, but now even fixing a pipe feels like I’m just... going through the motions.

interviewer: It sounds like this persistent fog has been really draining, even when you try to rest. Who have you found yourself relying on for support during this time?

patient: I guess I just... I don't really talk about this stuff with anyone. My boss? He sighs a lot when I ask for more time, but I guess that's better than being fired. The coffee keeps me going, but my hands still shake. You learn to hold it together, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like work is adding a lot of pressure, and you're managing it with coffee and pushing through. Is there anyone who helps you with practical things or listens when you need to talk, even if it's not about work?

patient: Not really. My boss just sighs when I need time, but he hasn’t let me go yet. I guess that’s... something? The coffee keeps me upright, but my hands still shake. You learn to ignore it, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of this alone. Have you found it helpful to talk to family members or friends about what you're going through?

patient: Family? I don’t want to bother them with my mess. My mom’s got her own struggles, I’m sure. We… we haven’t talked in a while. I guess I just figure if I can’t fix my own problems, I shouldn’t expect anyone else to fix mine. Like how I don’t ask my boss for a second raise when I’m already stretching hours. You keep going, right? Even if your hands shake and your head feels like a slow leak.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of responsibility and worry about being a burden. Have you noticed any specific reasons why you feel your mom might not want to hear about your struggles right now?

patient: My mom worked her fingers to the bone for this family. I guess I figure if I’m failing at my own life, the last thing she needs is another broken thing to fix. Like that leaky pipe I couldn’t seal—some problems just... seep through.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to carry that weight alone. Has your mom ever talked about feeling overwhelmed or struggling with her own health or energy in the past?

patient: My mom... she always had this quiet way of getting things done. I remember her saying once that immigrants don’t get to complain about tiredness, you know? She just kept going. Me? I guess I’m learning the same thing. The last time I called, I couldn’t even stay on for long—felt like my words were sponging up all her time. I don’t want to be another thing she has to fix.

interviewer: It sounds like your mom's example has shaped how you handle stress and challenges. How do you think that background influences how you're approaching things now?

patient: I guess I just learned to keep going, you know? My mom always fixed things without making a fuss. Now, even when I'm barely holding on, I just keep patching up the leaks. But sometimes... the fixes don't hold.

interviewer: It sounds like your mom's resilience has shaped how you handle challenges, even when it's hard. Can you think of any strategies or strengths you've developed that help you keep going, even when things feel overwhelming?

patient: I guess... I just keep patching things until they hold. Like, if the pipes leak, I wrap them tighter. If the noise keeps me up, I brew extra-strong chai to drown it out. My mom always said, 'Fix it, don’t whine about it.' So I do that. Even when my hands shake from the coffee, I figure it’s better to be busy than let the quiet in. But... sometimes the patches start to look like spiderwebs. You know?

interviewer: It sounds like your mom's approach has shaped how you handle stress. Can you tell me how you think growing up with that mindset affects the way you manage stress now?

patient: It’s like... I was taught to wire everything myself. If a circuit sparks, you tape it, right? You don’t call an electrician. Even now, when my head feels like a frayed wire, I just wrap it tighter. But sometimes the tape peels off, and you realize the current’s still there—same as always. Just... quieter.

interviewer: It sounds like your mom's experiences as an immigrant may have deeply influenced how you approach hardship. Can you share if there were any particularly difficult experiences your mom faced that shaped her view of perseverance?

patient: She once told me that immigrants don’t get to complain about tiredness. She just kept going, even when her hands ached from work. I guess I learned to do the same. But sometimes... the aching doesn’t stop, and I don’t know if taping it tighter helps anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot of weight lately. Have you been having thoughts about ending your life?

patient: I guess... if a machine just... shuts off, you don’t blame the power source, right? It’s more like the wiring’s frayed. But I’m just tired. Most days, I’d rather sleep through the noise than think about fixing it.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of emotional weight. Have you had any specific thoughts about ending your life that you'd feel comfortable discussing?

patient: I don’t think about it like that. It’s more… I just feel like my battery’s been dead for so long, and I’m still trying to power through. But most days, the thought of even fixing a leak feels like too much. I guess if my body just stopped needing to recharge, maybe that’d be easier? But I don’t really plan for it. Just… tired. Always tired.

interviewer: I hear how overwhelming and exhausting this must feel. Have you had any specific thoughts about how you might end your life?

patient: I don’t think about specifics, like... methods or anything. It’s more like, if I could just sleep past the noise, maybe the day would fix itself. But I don’t even have the energy to think about it clearly. My hands are too shaky to hold a wrench, let alone... anything else. Just tired. Always tired.

interviewer: It sounds like the fatigue and lack of energy are really impacting your daily life. Have you been using any other substances, like alcohol or cannabis, to cope with the tiredness or stress?

patient: Not really. Maybe a drink here and there at family stuff. But mostly just coffee—my hands are already shaky enough from that. Doesn’t do much, but it’s something.

interviewer: Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns recently, such as sleeping more or less than usual?

patient: I guess I’m not sleeping through the night much. Lie awake till the pipes start groaning, you know? My mind’s too busy troubleshooting... everything from the neighbor’s noise to that leaky faucet I never fixed. But it’s just stress, right? Old houses creak, and so do sleepless nights.

interviewer: It sounds like your fatigue is affecting even basic tasks. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs or vitamins?

patient: No, nothing like that. I guess I just rely on coffee—way too much of it. My hands still shake a bit from it, but at least I can function. Vitamins? I tried some last year, but they didn’t do much. You start to think, maybe your body’s just… broken in a way pills can’t fix.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight without much relief. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life in the past week that feel different from before?

patient: I don’t know… it’s like my brain’s on a loop. Sometimes I think, *what if I just… didn’t wake up?* But it’s not like I’m planning anything. It’s more like… if the day was quieter, maybe it wouldn’t matter. But I guess that’s just tired thoughts. You get used to the noise, right?

interviewer: It sounds like these thoughts come up often despite your exhaustion. How frequently have you been having these 'tired thoughts' about not waking up?

patient: It’s like that leak in the ceiling—always there, dripping steady. Some days louder than others, but yeah… it’s just part of the noise now. You learn to ignore it, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like these thoughts are a constant presence for you. Have you noticed any periods in the past where you felt unusually energetic or had little need for sleep, even when you were tired?

patient: No, nothing like that. I’ve just been… steady, I guess? Like a battery that’s slowly dying instead of flickering. The only time I stay up late is when the neighbor’s noise keeps me up, or when I’m trying to finish a job before my hands shake too bad. But that’s not really 'energy'—that’s just… grinding through it.

interviewer: I understand how draining this must be. Have you been using any stimulants, opioids, or other substances to manage your fatigue or stress?

patient: No, nothing else—just the coffee, like I said. Maybe a glass of wine now and then at family gatherings. You know, to… quiet the noise. But that’s not really a fix, is it? More like patching a leak with tape. It holds for a bit, then the water just finds another way through.

interviewer: It sounds like the wine helps for a while but not long-term. How often have you been drinking alcohol recently, and have you noticed any changes in how it affects you?

patient: It’s not like I’m getting drunk or anything. Maybe a glass or two when the kids are over at family gatherings—keeps the noise in the background, you know? But the next day, my hands shake worse than usual. Feels like the coffee and wine are just… fighting each other. I tell myself it’s ‘social,’ but honestly? It’s just another leak I patch with tape.

interviewer: I understand how the combination of coffee and wine might feel like a temporary fix. Have you used any other substances, such as cannabis, prescription medications, or opioids, to manage stress or fatigue?

patient: No, I don’t mess with anything else. Coffee’s my only vice, and even that’s just to keep the gears turning. Sometimes I think if I could just fix my sleep, maybe the rest would sort itself out. But... you know how it is.

interviewer: I hear how coffee feels like both a necessity and a burden for you right now. Have you ever had periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep, even when you were physically tired?

patient: No, not really. I’ve been so drained most days that even staying up late to finish a job feels like dragging myself through mud. The only time I maybe slept less was when I rewired that old outlet in the apartment—had to get it done before the landlord hassled me again. But that’s just… keeping the lights on, you know? The next day, my hands were still shaking from coffee, so I don’t count that as energy.

interviewer: I hear how the fatigue feels like a constant strain. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, such as hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or having thoughts that someone is trying to control or harm you?

patient: No, nothing like that. But sometimes my mind feels... foggy, like a circuit that’s not firing right. Just tired, I guess. The noise from the neighbor doesn’t help either.

interviewer: It sounds like caffeine and alcohol are your primary coping mechanisms right now. Have you noticed any periods in the past where you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep, even when you were physically tired?

patient: No, not really. I’ve been so drained most days that even pushing through feels like dragging myself through wet cement. The coffee keeps me from flatlining, but it’s not energy—it’s more like a stopgap. Had to rewire that outlet for the landlord last month, stayed up late to do it. Felt like a zombie the next day, hands still shaking from the coffee. Guess that’s just… part of the job, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like the coffee is both keeping you going and adding to the physical strain. Have you noticed any other medical issues that might be contributing to your fatigue or shaking, like thyroid problems, sleep apnea, or chronic pain?

patient: No, I guess not. Just... stress, I suppose. And too much coffee. My hands shake worse when I’m trying to fix something anyway. The landlord’s messes don’t help, but I don’t think it’s anything medical. I’m just tired, is all.

interviewer: Putting this all together, it sounds like you’ve been feeling overwhelmed by a mix of ongoing stressors—like work demands, financial pressures, and the noisy neighbor—that started adding up a few months ago. This has led to a sense of being emotionally detached, physically drained, and struggling to keep up with even basic tasks. The thoughts of not wanting to wake up are really concerning, even if they feel passive right now. What did I miss or get wrong about how things are showing up for you?

patient: You’ve got the gist—like a battery that’s been slowly draining. The coffee’s just keeping it from dying completely, but... yeah, the landlord’s messes don’t help. I guess I’ve been stuck in this loop of fixing what I can, even if it’s just temporary patches. The rest? It’s the same tired hum you learn to ignore, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot of weight—like trying to hold up a house with frayed wires and leaky pipes, hoping the coffee can keep the lights on. Let me try to map this out: long-standing family patterns of quiet resilience and self-reliance (what you called ‘fixing leaks with tape’) may have set the stage for how you’re handling this. Recent stressors like the landlord issues, work demands, and your divorce seem to have pushed you past your usual coping threshold, leading to this exhaustion and emotional numbness. The passive thoughts about not wanting to wake up feel like a signal that your system is overloading, even if you’re not ready to talk about deeper changes yet. What am I missing or misrepresenting here?

patient: You’re not wrong about the tape-and-leak thing. It’s just… my mom’s always had that same quiet fix-it mindset. Immigrant hustle, I guess. But she’s not even here to see this mess. I’d rather drink myself to sleep than call her and sound like a failure. The rest? Yeah, the landlord’s a nightmare. But you’re right—I’m just patching cracks that won’t stay sealed.

interviewer: I hear how the pressure to handle everything alone, especially with your mom's example, feels like a weight you can't shake. Is there anything else I haven't touched on that's part of this pattern or these stressors for you?

patient: Yeah... the boss’s sighs when I tell him I need more time. Feels like he’s already writing me off. Took extra shifts to cover the rent hike, but now I’m so wiped, even the chai’s a chore. Mom never complained about her work, so I guess I’m just... supposed to keep patching?

interviewer: I hear how the boss's sighs and extra shifts are compounding your sense of being stretched thin. What did I miss or get wrong about how these stressors are showing up for you?

patient: I guess... the divorce didn’t just drain the battery. Some folks thought fixing things wasn’t real work, so I had to prove ’em wrong. Now the extra shifts? They’re just... making the cracks bigger. Even the chai feels like a project I can’t finish. Mom never complained, so I guess I’m supposed to keep quiet too.

interviewer: It sounds like we’ve identified key themes: your family’s pattern of quiet resilience shaping how you handle stress, recent stressors like the divorce and landlord issues acting as triggers, and ongoing pressures from work and self-imposed expectations worsening your exhaustion and detachment. The passive thoughts about not wanting to wake up feel like a sign your system is overloading. What am I missing or misrepresenting here?

patient: You’re right about the stressors stacking up, but maybe you’re not seeing how every small mistake at work feels like a permanent mark on me. And the silence with my mom—like another crack I can’t patch. Oh, and the wine I drink at family stuff to quiet the noise? It just makes the static louder afterward. It’s not even a real fix.

interviewer: I hear how the fear of permanent mistakes at work and the unspoken tension with your mom are adding to your sense of being trapped in unfixable cracks. Let me check if this is accurate: We’ve identified chronic stress from work demands, financial strain, and family dynamics; a pattern of self-reliance masking emotional burden; and passive suicidal ideation as a signal of overload. Is there something important I’ve missed or misunderstood?

patient: The rent hike and extra shifts feel like digging a hole I can’t climb out of. And the boss’s sigh when I asked for time—like he’s counting cracks in my foundation. Oh, and the chai I used to look forward to? Feels like another task now, not a break.

interviewer: It sounds like we’ve woven together how your family’s quiet resilience, recent stressors like the divorce and landlord issues, and the relentless pressure to ‘keep patching’ are creating a cycle where even small joys—like chai—lose their spark. What parts of this feel off or need adjustment?

patient: You’re not wrong about any of it. Maybe just that the boss’s sighs... they don’t just feel like frustration. They feel like he’s tallying every crack I hide. And the sleep? I used to pride myself on working through it, but now I just... crash early, then hate myself for not being ‘productive.’ It’s another loop.

interviewer: Before we wrap up, let me make sure we’re on the same page about next steps. We’ll schedule your first follow-up, and in the meantime, if you ever feel overwhelmed by thoughts of not wanting to wake up, who could you reach out to for support?

patient: I don’t know. My mom? But we don’t really talk. I guess I just... power through. Or pour a glass of wine and hope the static goes away. It never does, though. The cracks just get louder.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight alone. Let's create a simple safety plan—what could be one small step you'd feel comfortable taking if these thoughts become overwhelming?

patient: I guess... I could try calling my mom. Even if we don’t talk much, just hearing her voice might help. But what if she says something like, ‘You should be used to this by now’? Then I’d just... I don’t know. Maybe I’ll start with the chai. Even if it’s a chore, the routine might keep me from... crashing too hard.

interviewer: It takes courage to consider reaching out, especially when it feels so uncertain. Let’s note calling your mom or making chai as grounding steps for now. Before we close, is there anything else you’d like to clarify or address today?

patient: Maybe... just that the chai’s still something. It’s not much, but it’s one thing I can do without the hands shaking too bad. The boss’s sighs? They’ll pass. I’ll patch the cracks as they come. I guess that’s it.
