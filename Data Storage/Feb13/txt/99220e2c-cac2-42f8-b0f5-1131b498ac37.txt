system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Hello Justin, welcome. Just to confirm, is 'Justin' the name you'd prefer to be called?

patient: Yes, Justin. Justin Gamble. It’s on my old design portfolio—still kicking myself for that client rejection, honestly. (shrugs, fingers tapping the armrest) You know how it is, right? The whole identity tied to a job title thing.

interviewer: It sounds like work has been really consuming for you lately... Would you be comfortable proceeding with this interview so we can explore what’s been going on?

patient: I guess work’s always been a safe escape, you know? (fidgets with watch strap) It’s not like I’m drowning or anything—just… keeping the wheels turning. Maria says I’m overthinking the client thing, but (shrugs, pauses) to be honest, it’s easier to fix a logo than figure out why I can’t sleep past 3 a.m.

interviewer: Can you tell me more about what’s been troubling you most lately?

patient: It’s mostly the client thing, you know? I guess I keep replaying it, wondering if I’m missing something. To be honest, even when I try to rest, my mind just... races. It’s like trying to design a logo with your hands tied behind your back. Maria says I’m too hard on myself, but (shrugs, jaw tightens) it’s easier to fix a logo than admit I’m scared I’m past my prime. And the sleep? (laughs shortly) More like 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. most nights. Old and creaky, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like the client situation has been really weighing on you, especially with the sleep loss making it harder to recharge. When did you first start noticing these worries about the client and the pressure to perform?

patient: I guess it started maybe six months ago, after the client rejected the portfolio. (fidgets with watch strap, jaw clenching slightly) It wasn’t just that one project—it felt like the pressure kept tightening, like… tightening the screws on a design that already had no room to breathe. To be honest, even before the rejection, I was working late nights, telling myself it was just 'being proactive,' but Maria noticed my sleep getting worse first. (pauses, rubs neck) She’s the one who mentioned the 'creaky' jokes, actually. I didn’t realize how much I’d been… grinding, you know? Like my whole career was a Photoshop layer I couldn’t unselect.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure has been building up over time, especially after the client rejection. What are your goals for seeking help today?

patient: I guess... I want to learn how to stop letting the worries take over. It’s like trying to design a logo with your hands tied behind your back—no matter how hard I focus, the details always feel out of reach. To be honest, I just want to sleep through the night without checking the client emails at 3 a.m.

interviewer: It sounds like the client rejection has added significant pressure to an already heavy workload. Have you experienced similar episodes of anxiety or work-related overwhelm in the past, and if so, what helped during those times?

patient: I guess... there were times in the past when I’d push through by working nonstop, like trying to outrun the stress. To be honest, I never really saw it as ‘anxiety’ before—just thought I was... you know, old and creaky. My jaw used to lock up so bad I’d need to chew gum to loosen it, and I’d drink way too much coffee to stay ‘awake’ even though my head felt foggy. But this time feels different. The sleep thing... it’s not just deadlines anymore. Maria’s always saying I need to rest, but how do you explain to someone that your brain won’t hit ‘save’ and let you power down?

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing that. Could you tell me if you're currently taking any medications, supplements, or over-the-counter drugs, including things like vitamins or herbal remedies?

patient: I guess... I take a multivitamin most days and some antacids when my stomach acts up. And coffee—way too much coffee. Old and creaky, right? My doctor says I’m a walking pharmacy, but I’m not on anything... heavy. Just, you know, the basics.

interviewer: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: I guess... I’ve thought about how quiet it would be if the universe finally gave me a break. But then I remember Maria’s crossword puzzles, and I figure I owe it to her to keep... troubleshooting. No, I haven’t gone there. Just... sometimes the weight feels like a project with no end date.

interviewer: It’s meaningful that you think of Maria’s crossword puzzles as a reason to keep going. Have you been using alcohol or other substances like cannabis to cope with stress or sleep lately?

patient: I guess... maybe a glass of wine on weekends? But nothing I’d call ‘coping.’ Coffee’s my real issue—old and creaky, right? My doctor says I’m a walking pharmacy, but I’m not on anything... heavy. Just, you know, the basics.

interviewer: It sounds like your sleep patterns are quite disrupted. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or felt the need to stay busy all the time, even when you're tired?

patient: I guess I’ve always been the type to burn the midnight oil, you know? It’s not like I’m out here sprinting, but… I get restless if I’m not doing something. Coffee’s my crutch, I suppose. To be honest, the other night I was fixing a photo in Photoshop at 2 a.m. and my jaw was so tight it hurt—Maria had to remind me to chill. But then again, being old and creaky’s a bonus, right? Slower metabolism and all.

interviewer: It sounds like working late and restlessness are significant for you. Have you felt more energetic or needed less sleep than usual over the past few months, even when trying to rest?

patient: No, not really. I’m not exactly brimming with energy, but I guess my body’s on a different schedule. My jaw’s been acting up again, so maybe I’m just… creakier than usual. I tried the crossword last night, but even that felt like trying to design a logo with one hand tied behind my back. Maria says I’m overthinking it, but how do you ‘unthink’ deadlines when they’re in your bones?

interviewer: It sounds like your body’s been running on a different rhythm. Have you had any periods over the past few months where you felt unusually energetic, restless, or like you needed very little sleep—maybe even when you were physically tired?

patient: No, not really. It’s more like... the restlessness is constant. I try to power through with coffee, but my jaw’s been a wreck. Last week, I was up editing a photo at 1 a.m. because the dog next door was barking—Maria says I’m my own worst client.

interviewer: It sounds like irritability has been part of your experience lately. Have you felt unusually irritable or taken more risks than usual in the past few months, even when it might not have been wise?

patient: I guess I’ve been... snappier than usual? My jaw’s been so tight it feels like a vice, and sometimes Maria says something and I just... snap. Then feel bad about it. But it’s not like I’m taking risks—I’m just stuck in this loop of overthinking. The dog next door doesn’t help. Last week I almost yelled at it through the window. Almost.

interviewer: It sounds like the tension is really getting to you, especially with the jaw clenching and snapping at Maria. Have you noticed any unusual thoughts, like hearing things others don’t, or believing something odd that others might not agree with?

patient: Unusual thoughts? I guess not really. I mean, the dog next door does sound like it’s barking at me personally, but that’s just its M.O. I’ve been… hyper-aware of noises lately. Like, if the fridge hums, I notice it. But no, nothing weird. Just… my head feels like a spreadsheet that’s missing half its formulas. Maria says I’m overcomplicating things, but how do you un-clench something that’s been tight for years? The crossword helps, though. At least the clues don’t judge me.

interviewer: It seems your mind is processing sounds differently lately. Have you ever been diagnosed with chronic pain, thyroid issues, or sleep apnea that might relate to your tension or sleep patterns?

patient: I guess hypertension’s a given when you’re my age, but they call it ‘essential’ now, so it’s not like I’ve got a broken machine or anything. To be honest, I chalk up the tension to… well, to everything. Deadlines, the dog next door that barks like a chainsaw every time I try to unwind, you know? Maria says I should take naps, but I just feel guilty resting when there’s a dozen things to fix. They ever tell you the universe sends signs if you’re ready to stop suffering? I’m still waiting for mine.

interviewer: Justin, from what you've shared, your main concerns are work-related anxiety and insomnia that started around six months ago, especially after a client rejected your portfolio. This has led to constant worry about your professional competence, difficulty sleeping past 3 a.m., and using work and coffee to cope. You mentioned feeling like you're 'past your prime' and snapping at your partner, Maria, which worries her. You also noted that your hypertension and irritability are affecting your daily life, but you're committed to improving things because of Maria. Does this capture your experience accurately, or did I miss something important?

patient: Yeah, that’s… that’s pretty much it. The dog’s still my personal panic attack, and the coffee’s like my second heartbeat at this point. Maria’s crossword thing’s the only normal part of my day, honestly. I guess I just keep thinking if I tweak the designs enough, maybe the universe’ll send that sign I’m not… you know, completely broken.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure you're feeling is tied up in both your work identity and the ways you're trying to cope, like with coffee and staying busy. What did I miss about how these patterns started or what keeps them going for you?

patient: I guess it’s the need to control everything—like in design, if you mess up the layers, the whole thing falls apart. So I do the same with life, right? Too many layers to fix. The dog’s just one I can’t unselect. But… Maria’s crossword? That’s the only time I actually pause. To be honest, I think it started with my mom—she always said ‘busy equals valuable.’ Now it’s just… noise. Coffee, deadlines, noise.

interviewer: It sounds like your need for control stems from both professional pressures and deeper beliefs about self-worth, shaped by messages like 'busy equals valuable' from your mom. Let me recap: Over the past six months, client rejection amplified existing perfectionism, leading to anxiety, insomnia, and over-reliance on coffee/work to cope. Maria’s crossword routine is your rare moment of pause. What did I miss or misframe about how these pieces connect?

patient: You’ve got the layers right—the design thing, the noise, the crossword. What you might’ve missed is… my sister’s cancer diagnosis. It’s like adding static to an already fuzzy signal. I joke about her ‘knocking on heaven’s door’ to feel in control, but it’s just another layer I can’t unselect. And baking—my cake recipe’s 20 steps with exact measurements. It’s the only time I let myself… what’s the word? Oh, ‘rest’ feels too dangerous. I guess I’m just proving I can still measure things right. Hypertension? Please. It’s just my body’s way of saying ‘you’re overediting life,’ but I’ll chalk it up to old age again.

interviewer: It sounds like your sister’s diagnosis has added another layer of complexity to your already overwhelming experience. Is there anything else I should include about how this or other factors are shaping your current situation before we discuss next steps?

patient: I guess… the sister thing is just another layer I can’t unselect. I joke about her ‘knocking on heaven’s door’ to make it feel manageable, but it’s like adding static to everything else. And baking—my cake’s 20 steps with exact measurements. It’s the only time I let myself… what’s the word? Oh, ‘rest’ feels too dangerous. I guess I’m just proving I can still measure things right. Hypertension? Please. It’s just my body’s way of saying ‘you’re overediting life,’ but I’ll chalk it up to old age again.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing how your sister’s diagnosis and baking routine add to the layers of pressure you’re managing. Let me briefly recap: Your anxiety and insomnia over the past six months stem from professional perfectionism, a client rejection, your sister’s illness, and a need to control through structured activities like baking. Protective factors include Maria’s support and moments of pause like the crossword. What did I miss or misframe about how these pieces connect?

patient: I think you hit most of it. Maybe just... the dog next door? The one I joke about being my 'personal panic attack'? It’s not just the barking—it’s how it hijacks my head when I’m trying to... I don’t know, reset. Even baking, which’s supposed to be this controlled thing, feels fragile, like one wrong measurement and it’s ruined. Maybe that’s another layer I can’t unselect. And the coffee... I guess I still tell myself it’s just part of the job, even when my jaw’s screaming.

interviewer: It sounds like the dog’s barking and the fragility of baking are adding to the layers of pressure you’re managing. Is there anything else I should include about how these or other factors are shaping your experience before we discuss next steps?

patient: I guess the coffee and jaw clenching thing is a bigger deal than I let on. It’s like my body’s been screaming ‘enough’ for years, but I just chalk it up to being ‘old and creaky.’ Even when I try to rest, it’s this… hum under my skin. Sounds silly, right?

interviewer: It sounds like your body’s been trying to signal boundaries through physical tension and fatigue, even when your mind resists hearing it. What did I miss about how these physical signals connect to the patterns we’ve discussed before?

patient: I guess the coffee and jaw thing... it’s like my body’s on autopilot, right? Even when I’m baking, which should be calm, my hands still twitch a little. The dog’s barking doesn’t help—it’s like a soundtrack to my head spinning. But I tell myself it’s just age. Still, Maria’s crossword puzzles? They’re the only thing that actually pauses the noise, even for a minute.

interviewer: It sounds like your body’s been trying to signal boundaries through physical tension and fatigue, even when your mind resists hearing it. What did I miss about how these physical signals connect to the patterns we’ve discussed before?

patient: I guess the part I’m still… I don’t know, stitching together is how the restlessness feeds into the workaholism. Like, my jaw’s clenched from grinding through deadlines, but then the deadlines keep my mind from… what? Admitting I’m stuck? Even baking, which should be precise, feels like I’m one wrong move away from disaster. It’s like my body’s trying to say ‘slow down,’ but my head’s in Photoshop, fixing layers I don’t even need to touch.

interviewer: It sounds like your body’s persistent signals—like jaw clenching and sleeplessness—are clashing with a mindset that equates overwork with self-worth, even as it fuels your sense of being stuck. Let me recap: Your anxiety and insomnia began six months ago after a client rejection, worsened by your sister’s diagnosis and a need to control through structured tasks. Protective factors include Maria’s support and brief moments of pause. What did I miss or misframe about how these pieces connect?

patient: I think you got the main thread—workaholism as a shield, the dog’s barking as this... unwelcome reminder that I can’t even control my own headspace. Maybe what’s missing is how I brush off the hypertension meds, labeling them ‘tea samples’ to avoid facing that my body’s really sending a memo. But I guess that’s just another layer of ‘being old and creaky,’ right? Even when my hands shake while baking, I tell myself it’s just the dog’s fault.

interviewer: It sounds like avoiding your hypertension meds by labeling them as 'tea samples' is another way you're resisting facing physical limits, much like dismissing your body's signals through coffee and baking. Before we agree on next steps, is there anything else I should include about how these patterns or your recent reflections might shape our plan together?

patient: I guess... the dog’s barking doesn’t help, but the crossword—Maria’s puzzles—they’re like a reset button for me. I don’t know, maybe I’m just not ready to admit I need more than that. But if we’re talking about plans... maybe start with the sleep? I’ve been lying awake tracing pixels in my head, even when I’m ‘off.’ It’s not just the meds, though. It’s like my brain’s on auto-save, constantly backing up worries I can’t delete.

interviewer: It sounds like sleep is a key area to address, given how it’s affecting your energy and mental clarity. Let me check if we’re aligned: the plan would start with exploring strategies to quiet the ‘auto-save’ cycle at night, using Maria’s support and maybe adjusting your evening routine. Is there anything else we should include before moving forward?

patient: I guess starting with sleep makes sense—Maria’s puzzles are the only thing that’s ‘good enough’ to quiet the pixel-tracing, so maybe build from there. I’d be careful about adding new strategies, though… it’s like testing a design in too many browsers; you end up second-guessing everything. And if we’re being honest, the dog’s barking doesn’t help, but I’d rather not make it about that. Just… let’s see if the crossword can be the first layer. If it holds, great. If not, I’ll figure out the next fix.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve already identified some important steps toward managing your anxiety and sleep—how does that feel for you right now? Is there anything else we haven’t covered that feels important to address before we wrap up?

patient: I guess... it feels like a starting point, which is probably all I can ask for. The crossword thing, it’s not a fix, but it’s a... a known variable, you know? If I can hold that together, maybe the rest will follow. Though, to be honest, I’m still waiting for the dog’s barking to stop. It’s like my personal static, but I’ll take small wins.

interviewer: It sounds like the crossword routine offers some stability, even as other stressors like the dog’s barking linger. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to clarify or address as we move forward?

patient: I guess that’s it, really. The crossword’s a solid layer to build on, and I’ll admit… it’s easier than trying to troubleshoot the dog’s soundtrack. Just don’t want to over-design the plan—sometimes adding too many features breaks the whole thing. If the puzzles hold, maybe I’ll finally stop… you know, auto-saving every worry at 2 a.m. (pauses, then softens with a quiet chuckle) For what it’s worth, I’m not *completely* old and creaky yet.
