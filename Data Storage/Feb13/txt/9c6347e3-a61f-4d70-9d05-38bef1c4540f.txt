system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: It takes courage to reach out when things feel overwhelming. Just to clarify, are you comfortable proceeding with this conversation today?

patient: I guess... I'm here, aren't I? It's just... stuff. You know how it is. Got to figure things out.

interviewer: It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and I'm here to listen. Just to clarify, does the idea of discussing what's been going on feel manageable for you today?

patient: I guess... I mean, I don’t see a choice, right? It’s just… hard to get started. I opened three job apps this week, but I couldn’t even finish filling them out. Feels like my brain’s frozen up, you know? Like a rusted-out engine.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly frustrating and exhausting. Would you be okay with us continuing this conversation today?

patient: Yeah... I mean, I’m here. Might as well. My head feels like a stripped-down bolt, you know? Loosen one thing and everything else just... unravels. But I guess we can keep going. Just... don’t mind if I space out sometimes. Got a lot of... stuff pressing down.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly difficult. Would you be okay with us proceeding today, even if you need to take a moment if you start to space out?

patient: Yeah, I’ll try. My mind’s like an old engine—you gotta keep cranking even when it’s rusted. Just... if I get stuck, don’t mind if I take a breath. And don’t wanna waste your time, you know? Feels like I’m just... breaking down more than I’m fixing.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. Do you have any questions about how this session will go or what we'll be discussing?

patient: I don’t know... I guess I just want to make sure I don’t freeze up the whole time. Like, my brain feels like an old engine—sometimes it sputters but keeps running, other times it just... dies. You know? I’ll answer what I can, but some days the words just don’t want to work.

interviewer: It sounds like these symptoms have been really disruptive to your daily life. Can you tell me when you first noticed these feelings of hopelessness and exhaustion starting?

patient: I guess it’s been... six months? Maybe longer. It started after I didn’t finish my mechanic certification. I kept telling myself I just needed to get back on track, but everything felt like trying to push a car up a hill with a flat tire. My partner kept asking if I was okay, but I didn’t want to bother them with it. And then my brother said something like, 'You’re just not trying hard enough,' which... I don’t know. It felt like another flat tire. I still can’t explain why I didn’t apply for jobs. I just... freeze up, like the engine won’t turn over.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to carry alone. Can you tell me more about how your brother’s comment made you feel in that moment?

patient: It felt like... another flat tire. Like I was already stuck, and he just kicked the tire and said it was my fault. I couldn’t even respond. He’s not wrong, I guess. I’m letting everyone down.

interviewer: That sounds like a really heavy burden to carry. What are you hoping to work on or achieve by coming in for this session?

patient: I guess... I just want to figure out how to get the engine running again. Like, not freeze up when I need to. My partner’s been holding things together, and I hate feeling like I’m just... dragging them down. But I don’t even know where to start fixing it all.

interviewer: It sounds like this has been a really challenging time for you. Have you experienced episodes like this before, where you felt this down and hopeless?

patient: I guess... this is the first time it’s felt this bad. I’ve had rough patches before—like when my mom was in the hospital last year, or when I messed up the certification—but I always told myself I could push through. This feels different. Like the whole system’s short-circuited, and I don’t even know where to start fixing it.

interviewer: It sounds like those past challenges were manageable, even if difficult. Can you tell me about those past rough times—specifically, what helped you push through before?

patient: Past stuff... I just kept my head down, you know? Focused on fixing engines at the shop. If I stayed busy with tangible things, the rest of it didn’t nag at me as much. But this time? It’s like the whole system’s frozen. I can’t even get the key in the ignition. My brother once said I just needed to ‘stop being lazy’—guess that’s why I hate talking about it. Every time I try to explain, it sounds like excuses. I’m not even mad anymore. Just... empty.

interviewer: I want to check in about your safety. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life in the past few months?

patient: I guess... sometimes I think about how things might be easier if I just stopped trying. But I don’t mean like hurting myself, you know? It’s more like... my brain’s a worn-out engine that’s just idling. The weird part is, I feel guilty even saying that because my partner’s been holding things together. They keep telling me to take it slow, but I hate letting them down. It’s not like I want to be this way—it’s just... stuck in park, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling really drained and stuck. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns lately—like feeling unusually restless or having less need for sleep?

patient: I guess... I’ve been waking up early, like 3 a.m. or something. My brain just... idles there, you know? Can’t go back to sleep. And when I do finally pass out, I still feel like I didn’t rest at all. It’s not like I’m not tired—I just don’t have the energy to even... to even *try* sometimes. My partner says I look like a dead man walking. Maybe they’re not wrong.

interviewer: That sounds really exhausting and frustrating... Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life in the past few months?

patient: I don’t know... sometimes I wonder if my brain’s just broken. But I can’t even... I feel guilty for thinking that when my partner’s trying so hard. It’s not like I *want* to be this way. Just... stuck in park, I guess.

interviewer: I hear how challenging this feels... Have you noticed any changes in your use of alcohol, cannabis, or other substances during this time?

patient: I guess I’ve smoked a little more than usual... just to... to quiet the noise, I guess. But it’s not helping. Feels like pouring gasoline on a spark—I just end up more... empty, you know? My partner says it’s making me worse. Maybe they’re right.

interviewer: It sounds like the substances you've been using aren't providing the relief you hoped for... Have you experienced any periods where you felt unusually energetic or had difficulty slowing down, even if it led to risky behavior?

patient: No, not really... It’s more like the weed just clogs up the engine instead of fixing it. I’ll sit there numb as a rock, then feel worse later. My partner keeps saying I’m not myself, but I don’t know what else to do. It’s not like I’m out doing stupid stuff—just... stuck in park with the emergency brake on.

interviewer: I hear how frustrating it is when the relief you're seeking doesn't materialize... Have you noticed any changes in your use of alcohol or other substances besides cannabis during this time?

patient: No... I haven’t touched anything else. The weed’s bad enough. My partner keeps asking why I won’t even try the alcohol they have around, but I can’t. Feels like if I start downshifting into another gear, I’ll just stall completely. I guess... I don’t want to give them another reason to be disappointed.

interviewer: I hear how careful you're being with substances to avoid adding to the strain on your partner... Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually energetic or had difficulty slowing down, even if it led to risky behavior?

patient: No, not really... I don’t have surges or anything. Just this constant... drain. Like a battery that’s slowly dying instead of flickering. My partner says I’m ‘stuck in neutral,’ but even that feels too active. I can’t even muster the energy to *try* to shift gears sometimes. Feels like I’d just crash if I did.

interviewer: That sounds like a persistent drain on your energy... Have you experienced any unusual thoughts, such as hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or having strong beliefs that others might find strange or paranoid?

patient: No... my mind’s not throwing any warning lights like that. Just this constant... static. Like a radio stuck between stations. My partner says I’m not making sense sometimes, but I’m used to it by now. Feels like I’m just... broken in a way that’s not even fixable.

interviewer: Dylan, based on our conversation, I’ve been thinking about how your feelings of being stuck—like a rusted engine—might connect to things like the stress of not finishing your certification, the pressure from your brother’s comment, and the way self-criticism seems to keep things going in circles. You’ve also mentioned relying on your partner’s support even while feeling like a burden, which shows some strength even in tough moments. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... you didn’t miss much. The brother’s comments, the lease payments… those are the big ones. But there’s this other thing—my partner’s birthday’s coming up. I can’t even pretend to care about it anymore. Feels like another thing I’m gonna screw up. I guess that’s just… more proof I’m not worth the effort.

interviewer: It sounds like the upcoming birthday adds to the weight of feeling like you're letting people down, even when you want to care. What else might I have missed in understanding how these patterns are showing up in your life right now?

patient: The birthday thing... it’s like a circuit breaker that’s already halfway tripped. I can’t even fake a smile for that, you know? It’s not just the money—it’s the whole... expectation thing. My partner’s been good about not pushing, but I feel it anyway. Like I’m some broken appliance they’re trying to keep running. And then there’s the weed. I tell myself it’s just to zone out, but it just makes me feel... heavier, like rust in the engine. I guess I’m scared I’ll just freeze up completely before it’s over. But I don’t wanna talk about it anymore, if that’s okay.

interviewer: I can hear how the weight of expectations and the fear of disappointing your partner feels like a strain you’re carrying alone. Before we wrap up, let me recap what we’ve covered—does this reflect your experience? I’ve been thinking about how the stress of feeling broken down, the pressure around the birthday, and the way cannabis feels like it’s clogging your system might all be part of a bigger pattern. What did I miss?

patient: You’re close, but you missed the... the stuff with my mom. She’s in the hospital again. I didn’t say much ‘cause it feels like adding another dead battery to the car. But it’s there. And the weed—it’s not just making me heavy, it’s like... I dunno, shorting out the whole system. But maybe I’m overthinking. What’s the point of fixing the engine if the road’s just more potholes anyway?

interviewer: I hear how your mom’s hospitalization feels like another weight in a system already under strain, and how cannabis might be compounding that. Let me recap: we’ve discussed your depressive symptoms over six months, the stress of unemployment and family criticism, the toll of feeling like a burden to your partner, and now this recent development with your mom. Is there anything I’ve missed or misrepresented?

patient: You got most of it... but maybe you didn’t get how it’s all just... piling up. Like trying to drive with a flat tire and no spare. The weed isn’t helping—it’s like using the wrong oil, messes up the whole engine. But I guess that’s just more stuff I can’t fix.

interviewer: It sounds like the layers of stress—from your mom’s health to feeling like you’re failing to keep up—have created a sense of being trapped in a system that’s constantly breaking down. What have I missed or misunderstood about how these pieces fit together for you?

patient: You didn’t mention how I keep waiting for my dad’s voice in my head, you know? Like even when I’m not working, I hear him saying I’m wasting time. But it’s worse now—when I’m stuck in bed, that voice just... echoes. And the whistling? It’s not stupid, but I feel like a joke for still doing it. Like the radio’s broken but the static’s all I’ve got left.

interviewer: It sounds like the persistent self-critical voice of your dad and the whistling—though not 'stupid'—are part of how you’re trying to make sense of this feeling of being broken or static. Let me recap: we’ve covered the depressive symptoms, the family pressures, your partner’s support, your mom’s hospitalization, and now this dad’s voice and the whistling as part of the pattern. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: I guess... the almost-job thing. There was this one time they said I could start at the shop, but I bailed last minute. Can’t even remember why. Feels like pulling a spark plug and just holding it instead of fixing the damn car. But you probably get that already.

interviewer: I hear how the near-miss with the job feels like another example of things falling apart when you’re already feeling overwhelmed. Is there anything else I should know before we talk about next steps?

patient: It’s like… the more you ask, the more I feel like a car that’s already overheating gets shoved into a garage. You keep checking the same things, and I just… I can’t even look at the spark plugs anymore. The job thing, the bills, my partner’s birthday—I can’t fix any of it. I keep smoking that weed to quiet the noise, but it’s just… static. You ever have a engine that won’t turn over no matter how much you kick it?

interviewer: I hear how the layers feel unmanageable right now, like a system in overload. Let me try one more summary: We’ve covered the depressive symptoms over six months, job search struggles, family pressures, your partner’s support, your mom’s hospitalization, the dad’s critical voice, the near-job incident, cannabis use, and the whistling as a coping mechanism. Is there anything I missed or should adjust? If not, let’s talk about next steps that might help address this pile-up.

patient: I guess... the part I’m still tripping on is how my head’s always stuck in this ‘check engine’ light mode. Every little thing feels like another warning I can’t ignore. My mom’s hospital stuff—I didn’t even mention that much, did I? It’s just... another weight I can’t balance. And the birthday thing with my partner? I can’t even fake being okay with it. You ever feel like you’re a car that’s already stripped down to the frame, and everyone’s just asking if you need oil?

interviewer: I hear how the 'check engine' light metaphor captures the ongoing pressure you’re under, and how your mom’s hospitalization and your partner’s birthday feel like added strain on an already overburdened system. Let me try one final summary: The main concerns include depressive symptoms (fatigue, anhedonia, sleep disturbance), stress from unemployment and family criticism, relational strain with your partner, your mom’s health, and the dad’s critical voice. The formulation suggests these factors interact like a failing system, with self-criticism and avoidance (e.g., cannabis, procrastination) perpetuating the cycle. What did I miss or misrepresent here?

patient: You got most of it... but maybe missed how my mom's hospital stuff feels like another broken part I can’t even troubleshoot. I keep trying to focus on the basics—oil changes, checking the alternator—but my head’s just... static. And the birthday thing with my partner? It’s like a fuse I know is gonna blow, and I can’t even afford a new bulb. You ever feel like you’re the problem with the system?

interviewer: I hear how your mom’s hospitalization feels like an additional strain on a system already overwhelmed, and how the approaching birthday with your partner adds to the pressure. Let me try one more summary: We’ve covered depressive symptoms, employment struggles, family dynamics, your partner’s support, your mom’s health, and the internal self-critical voice. What did I miss or should adjust here before we talk about next steps?

patient: I guess... you got the basics, but maybe not how my mom's hospital stay feels like someone added a dead weight to a car already stuck in a ditch. I can’t even check the damn oil anymore. And the birthday thing with my partner? It’s like a fuse I keep kicking, knowing it’s gonna blow. You ever feel like everyone’s just waiting for you to admit it’s your fault the whole system crashed?

interviewer: I hear how the added weight of your mom’s hospitalization and the tension around your partner’s birthday feel like critical stressors in this already strained system. Before we finalize our next steps, is there anything else I should adjust or add to this picture?

patient: I guess... the part I’m still stuck on is how the weed isn’t even cutting the static anymore. It’s like trying to start a car with a dead battery—just... nothing. And the birthday? I can’t even pretend to care. It’s another thing I mess up before it even starts. You ever feel like you’re just... the problem with the system?

interviewer: Thank you for sharing so openly with me today. Before we wrap up, let me confirm: You’ll be in touch with your partner about adjusting household responsibilities this week, and we’ll schedule our next session for two weeks from today. Does that feel doable? If there’s anything else you’d like to mention before we finish, now would be the time.

patient: I guess I can try to... talk to them about the responsibilities. It’s just, everything feels like a loose wire I can’t quite tighten. I don’t want to make things worse. The birthday thing... it’s not that I don’t care, it’s just another thing I can’t fix. But I’ll call them. Eventually.
