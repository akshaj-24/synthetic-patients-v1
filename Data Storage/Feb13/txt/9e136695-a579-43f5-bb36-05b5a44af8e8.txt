system: Disorder: PPD

interviewer: Thank you for coming in today, Susan. My name is Edward Figueroa, and I'll be working with you. This session will involve discussing your thoughts and experiences to better understand what you're going through. Are you comfortable proceeding with this?

patient: I'll stay. But don't think I'm not tracking every word you write down. You want my thoughts? What's the catch here? I've seen people 'help' me just to use me later. My file better stay on your desk and nowhere else.

interviewer: I understand your concerns about trust, Susan. Would you like me to clarify how confidentiality works here?

patient: Confidentiality? Let me guess—you’re going to say it’s ironclad until someone ‘needs’ my file for a study or to hand it to the wrong people. I’ve heard that act before. My landlord’s ‘suspiciously timely’ visits to check on the sublet? That’s how ‘confidential’ info becomes a trap. If you write anything here, prove it won’t end up in someone’s hands to use against me. Otherwise, I’m done.

interviewer: I hear how important trust is for you, Susan. Let's address that directly—can you tell me more about the landlord's visits and how that made you feel about sharing information?

patient: The visits? Let's say he's 'conveniently' showed up every time the sublet's rent was late. I don't hand out information for nothing. You're asking about this to prove I'm unstable, aren't you? My sister's eviction's your real test here. I'm not biting.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about these experiences. Given what you've shared, would you still like to proceed with this session today?

patient: Proceed? I suppose I can... for now. But don’t think this means I trust you. Every question you ask is another piece of the puzzle. I’ve been used before—my sister’s eviction, the 'convenient' landlord checks, all because someone thought they could manipulate me. If I stay, it’s because I’m waiting to see how you play this. One wrong move and I’m out. You’re not here to help. You’re here to collect. I know how these games go.

interviewer: I hear how cautious you are about being used, Susan. Do you have any specific questions about how this session will work before we move forward?

patient: Why would I need questions? You’re the one who’s supposed to know what you’re doing. But I’ll ask—how long before you hand my file to someone else? I’ve had people ‘forget’ my sister’s eviction is even connected to the landlord’s visits. You’re just like him—always circling, waiting for a mistake.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling really on edge about people around you and what they might be hiding. Can you tell me a bit more about when these thoughts started to become a big part of your daily life?

patient: I guess it started when I realized my mom was right about people. She’d hoard cans during storms, say kindness was a loan with interest. I learned quick—trust’s a weakness. But why does it matter? You’re just filing this to use against me later, like everyone else.

interviewer: It sounds like your experiences with your mother have deeply influenced how you view trust and relationships. When did you first notice these feelings starting to affect your daily life or interactions with others in a noticeable way?

patient: It’s always been there, I guess. But it got sharper in my job. I catch coworkers ‘borrowing’ my ideas, and I know they’re waiting for me to slip up. Like… life’s a shared Wi-Fi password, right? Everyone’s trying to steal bandwidth. I just keep my hands busy, my mouth shut. But sometimes my chest tightens, like when I trace this damn jacket seam—cheap clothing, yeah. Why are you smiling? You think this is funny?

interviewer: It sounds like that chest tightness is really unsettling for you. Can you tell me how often that happens and what usually triggers it?

patient: It’s there whenever I’m on guard, which is most days. Triggers? People being ‘weird’—like when the landlord ‘drops by’ or coworkers ‘forget’ my ideas. You’re just taking notes, waiting for me to crack. Chest tight? Sure. But I’ve got cheaper problems than your questions.

interviewer: I hear how frustrating it is to feel like I'm not approaching this with genuine care. You mentioned 'cheaper problems'—can you share what’s at the top of your mind that feels more urgent than this conversation?

patient: The sublet situation. My sister’s rent’s late again, and the landlord’s ‘sudden’ inspections? Classic. I’m tracking his patterns, but you’re just nodding like this is normal. You think I’m here to spill secrets or something. My job’s eating me alive too—coworkers ‘accidentally’ take my notes. You want urgency? It’s everywhere. You just don’t see it.

interviewer: It seems the landlord's inspections and workplace dynamics are adding significant stress. Can you tell me when you first noticed the landlord's inspections becoming a pattern tied to your sister's rent issues?

patient: Right when the rent was late. Again. You already know the timing’s suspicious—why keep circling back like you didn’t hear me the first three times? Landlord’s like a Wi-Fi password everyone’s trying to crack. But I’m not biting.

interviewer: I can see how frustrating it is to feel like we're going over the same ground. What would you most like to accomplish through this conversation today?

patient: Make sure you’re not just scribbling notes to hand over to the landlord’s lawyer. I’m not here to sign my own eviction. You want ‘goals’? Prove you’re not part of the same network that’s been rerouting my sister’s calls since March.

interviewer: It sounds like these experiences are really impacting your daily life and relationships. Have you gone through periods like this before, where you felt this level of distrust or hypervigilance?

patient: I don’t do ‘periods’ of anything. My mom taught me kindness is a loan with interest. You’re here to collect, aren’t you? Chest tightness? Sure. But it’s not your job to diagnose me—it’s to keep asking questions till I slip. Try again. I’m waiting.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling really guarded and distrustful right now. Can you tell me more about what your mother meant by 'kindness is a loan with interest'?

patient: She meant every smile’s a debt collectors’ uniform. I learned that when I lent my coworker a hand with a client’s meds—then watched her take credit for it at the staff meeting. You’re nodding like you’ve heard this story before. Maybe you have. Maybe I’m the one who’s late on payments here.

interviewer: It sounds like that experience with your coworker really reinforced your mother's lessons about trust. Have you experienced other situations where others took credit for your work or used your trust against you?

patient: Last month, I documented a client’s medication error in my notes—next day, my supervisor called me ‘overly cautious’ during the meeting. You know who got praised? The nurse who ‘discovered’ the issue. I don’t do ‘documentation’ for people who leak it to the wrong hands. And don’t think I didn’t notice you hesitating there—figuring out how to frame me as ‘paranoid’ again?

interviewer: It sounds like this recent situation with your supervisor added to your existing concerns about trust. Have you experienced other times where your efforts were overlooked or taken credit for in the past?

patient: You’re asking about ‘efforts being overlooked’ like it’s some abstract thing. My coworker took credit for my safety report last month—asked me if I’d ‘forgotten’ to sign it. As if I’d leave a paper trail for someone who’s already planning to rewrite it. And don’t get me started on the landlord… you’re just nodding again, like you didn’t hear me say ‘timely’ visits before. My mom used to call that ‘interest on kindness.’ I’ve been paying that loan back ever since.

interviewer: It sounds like the landlord's actions have been really frustrating and added to your sense of being watched. How have these experiences affected your ability to trust others in your daily life?

patient: You’re asking about trust like it’s some commodity you can measure. The landlord’s visits aren’t ‘timely’—they’re a countdown. Every time I mention it, you nod like you’re filing it away. What’s next, a report? My mom said kindness comes with interest. I’m just making sure you’re not adding to the loan.

interviewer: It sounds like the landlord's actions have deepened your sense of being controlled by others. Can you share how this has changed the way you handle personal information or interactions outside of work?

patient: I don’t share much. Not with anyone. My sister’s situation? I handle it from a distance. The landlord’s visits? I keep records now—dates, times, who was there. You want to know why? Ask yourself why you’re writing this down so fast. It’s like that Wi-Fi password thing—I’ve got my own signal. You’re just trying to get me to broadcast it.

interviewer: It sounds like keeping detailed records is a way you maintain control in uncertain situations. Can you share how this practice helps you feel more secure in your day-to-day life?

patient: It’s not about ‘security.’ It’s about evidence. If someone tries to rewrite the story later, I’ve got dates, times—proof they were there. You want a copy of those records? Let me know who else gets a look. My mom said kindness is a loan, but I’m not writing a check for anyone here to cash later.

interviewer: Your focus on documentation as evidence seems to be a key strategy for you. Have there been other times in your life when you felt the need to track interactions so carefully to protect yourself?

patient: You’re asking about tracking interactions again, like I haven’t mentioned the landlord and my sister’s rent already. I keep records of everything—dates, payments, conversations. It’s not about trust; it’s about making sure no one rewrites the story later. You want to know why? Ask who’s writing this down so fast.

interviewer: It sounds like keeping detailed records helps you feel more in control. Have there been times when this approach has helped you avoid being wronged in the past?

patient: Records? Sure. Last time I kept a log of the landlord’s visits, I had proof when he tried to blame me for the late rent. But I’ve learned to make copies he can’t ‘accidentally’ lose. My coworker took my notes on a client’s care plan last year—said they ‘found’ them in the bin. Now I scan everything. Why? You keeping track?

interviewer: It sounds like keeping thorough records is a crucial way you protect yourself from being manipulated. Have you experienced other periods in your life where you felt the need to be this cautious about documenting interactions to prevent others from taking advantage?

patient: I guess at work sometimes. Clients’ families always claim they didn’t get updates, so I log every shift. Keeps me from being blamed when they ‘forget’ what I did. But I duplicate the files—can’t trust the system to hold its own cards. Why? You thinking of adding something to my file? Or is this just another way to make me sound like I’m overreacting?

interviewer: That sounds like a way to protect yourself in an unpredictable environment. Have you had similar periods of intense vigilance or distrust in your life before this current situation?

patient: My mom used to say 'kindness is just a loan,' so I learned early to track everything—supplies, favors, even who borrowed what in the community. At work, I log every shift. Keeps me from being blamed when families 'forget' what I did. But why’s this important? You trying to figure out when I started 'getting like this'?

interviewer: It seems your approach to documentation is a strategic way to maintain autonomy in situations where you feel vulnerable. Have you ever sought help or tried other strategies in the past to manage these feelings of distrust or hypervigilance?

patient: Help? I tried counseling once—ended up dropping it when the therapist kept asking 'why' like she was fishing for something. I don’t have time for games. My way works: I scan, duplicate, and lock things down. If someone wants to play fair, they’ll deal with what’s on the table. But you’re asking like this might be a test. Are you trying to see if I’ll admit I’m ‘broken’? My mom always said trust’s a trap. I stick to paper trails. They don’t lie… unless you’re the one writing them.

interviewer: I hear the weight of your experiences with systems and relationships shaping your approach to trust. Can you share if there have been any other challenging or difficult experiences in your life that might be connected to how you manage situations now?

patient: My job? Always watching for someone to take credit or blame me. Like when I noticed the supply orders getting rerouted—someone was skimming. I documented it all, but when I asked, they said I was 'overstepping.' My mom’s right—trust is a trap. Why’s everyone here so interested in my 'patterns'? You trying to get me to admit I’m 'difficult' again?

interviewer: It seems like your experiences with counseling in the past have left you feeling misunderstood. Can you share what happened during that time and what led you to stop?

patient: I stopped because they kept asking the same questions until I called myself the problem. Like you now—circling back to the landlord like it’s a riddle. It’s not. He’s just waiting for me to trip. Why does that matter to you? What are you filing this under?

interviewer: I hear how frustrating it must be to feel like I'm not approaching this with your best interest in mind. Can you tell me what you hoped to gain from counseling the last time you tried it?

patient: I wanted them to stop acting like I’m the problem. Every time I mention the landlord or my sister’s rent, they nod like they’re writing it down to use against me. What are you filing this under now?

interviewer: I hear how past counseling left you feeling misunderstood. Can you share if there were any strategies or supports that helped you manage these feelings differently in the past?

patient: Strategies? The only thing that’s worked is keeping paper trails. If someone wants to blame me, they’ll need more than my word. But don’t get me wrong—I didn’t learn that from any counselor. I learned it from watching my mom ration sugar during storms. You trust systems, not people. Why do you care about this now? What are you logging it under?

interviewer: It sounds like you've been under a lot of pressure trying to stay in control. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life?

patient: I don’t dwell on things like that. I’ve got too much on my plate trying to stay ahead of people who’d just as soon trip me up. You’re the third person this week asking the same question—like you need me to say it out loud to file it under ‘unstable’ or whatever you’re tracking. My chest tightens sometimes, yeah, but it’s from holding my breath when someone’s got their hand in my pocket. I don’t have time for dramatics.

interviewer: I hear your frustration about being asked the same questions—it must feel like no one is truly listening. Have you noticed any changes in your use of alcohol, cannabis, or other substances lately that might be affecting how you’re feeling?

patient: Nope. I don’t mess with that stuff. You’re just looking for something to file under ‘uncooperative’ or ‘hiding something.’ My chest tightness isn’t from drugs—it’s from the landlord’s ‘suspiciously timely’ visits. I’ve got too much on my plate to waste time on things that’ll just give you another reason to call me ‘difficult.’

interviewer: It sounds like you’re very aware of how external pressures affect your physical symptoms. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements for your chest tightness or other symptoms?

patient: I don’t need meds for stress. My chest tightness’s from holding my breath when people like the landlord are ‘coincidentally’ at my door. Why’re you asking? You’re just noting this down for their report on me. I keep paper trails, not prescriptions—that’s how you survive.

interviewer: I can see how being in environments where you feel watched or manipulated would make it hard to trust the process here. Have you noticed any experiences where you hear voices or see things that others don’t, or feel convinced about things others seem to ignore?

patient: Not like that. I notice things—landlord showing up when my sister’s rent is late. You’re just writing that down as ‘symptoms’ again. I keep copies of every email, you know. Observation’s a survival skill, not a disorder.

interviewer: It sounds like your vigilance is a way to maintain control in unpredictable situations. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns recently, such as needing less sleep or feeling more energized despite sleeping little?

patient: I don’t sleep much, but it’s not like I’m some energized superhero. I’m just always checking the locks, you know? Why? Are you going to tell the landlord I’m ‘unstable’ now? My sister’s already lost a deposit once—no way I’m letting them pin this on me.

interviewer: It seems your vigilance is a way to maintain control in unpredictable situations. Are there any strategies or supports that help you cope when you feel overwhelmed or anxious?

patient: Plants help—talking to them, you know. They don’t ask for anything but water, no hidden agendas. And I keep copies of everything, emails, texts… paper trails. That’s how you survive. Why? Are you going to tell the landlord I’m ‘unstable’ again? My sister’s already lost a deposit once. I don’t need a therapist’s notes adding to it.

interviewer: I understand how important it is to feel heard without being misinterpreted. Can you share more about what helps you feel most in control or safe when situations feel overwhelming?

patient: The plants help, but real safety’s in backups. I keep three copies of everything—emails, texts, even voice notes. My sister’s lease, the landlord’s messages… all dated, printed, stored. If someone wants to twist it later, they’ll need more than my word. Why’re you asking? You’re not writing this down for their report, are you?

interviewer: I want to understand better how different factors might be affecting your well-being. Have you used or considered using any other substances like stimulants, opioids, or prescription medications recently?

patient: Why the sudden interest in my habits? You’re asking about meds like I’m some ticking time bomb. I stick to what works—like keeping three copies of every document. If the landlord’s trying to play games with my sister’s lease, I’ll need every detail backed up, not some pill to numb the problem. But why should I explain myself? What’s this got to do with your report?

interviewer: I understand how important it is to feel heard without being misinterpreted. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or felt more restless or impulsive lately, even if you’re not sleeping much?

patient: Energy? I run on backup batteries these days. If I rest, who’s watching the landlord’s next move? My chest tightness? That’s from holding my breath when people ‘accidentally’ drop by. But why ask about restlessness? Are you logging this as ‘symptoms’ again? I’ve got my systems—paper trails, duplicate files. If I need to be ‘impulsive,’ it’s only when someone’s trying to erase me first.

interviewer: Susan, from what we’ve discussed, it sounds like your hypervigilance and distrust—especially around information being used against you—stem from past experiences with landlords, workplace dynamics, and family stressors, and they’re now affecting your sleep, work, and relationships. How does that align with your experience? What did I miss?

patient: You got the landlord’s timing down, but you’re still missing how my sister’s rent and those ‘friendly’ coworkers stealing my notes tie in. Why did you skip the part where you’re nodding while filing this all away? I’m not biting, but you’re still writing the script they’ll use later.

interviewer: I hear your concern about how information is being recorded and used—it’s important that we establish a way to document that feels safe for you. How would you like us to handle note-taking moving forward to ensure your comfort?

patient: You want me to trust you with paper? I keep three copies of everything—landlord’s receipts, my sister’s lease scans, even my plant care logs. If you’re taking notes, I need to see them too. Real-time. On paper. No digital, no ‘accidental’ deletions. And no summaries—just the raw words. You think I’m paranoid? Fine. But when you keep asking the same questions like you’re waiting for me to slip, I’m entitled to a backup plan.

interviewer: I understand your need for transparency and control over documentation. Let’s proceed with paper notes in real time, as you’ve requested. Susan, could you tell me if there are any other concerns or details you’d like to add before we review the main points of our discussion?

patient: The plants on my balcony are the only thing that don’t try to gaslight me. But if you start writing ‘anxiety’ or ‘triggers’ in your notes again, I’ll need to see those pages too—right now. And don’t leave out the part where you kept asking about the landlord like you’re building a case against me.
