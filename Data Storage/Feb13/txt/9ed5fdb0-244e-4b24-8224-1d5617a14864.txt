system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that with me, Barbara. Would you be comfortable continuing with this interview today?

patient: Yes, I... I suppose it’s necessary. Like a patient needing rounds, even when the prognosis feels hopeless. I’ll... try not to lose focus this time.

interviewer: Thank you for being here, Barbara. How would you like to proceed today?

patient: I... suppose we could start with the things I’ve been avoiding. Like the cookies. I still make them, but the kitchen feels like a sterile ward now—everything takes twice as long, and I can’t taste the sugar. My husband says they’re ‘authentically medicinal’ now. (pauses, forced humor fades) If that’s allowable. I know that sounds trivial compared to... other things. But even small tasks feel like they’re being performed under general anesthesia.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Would you like to ask anything before we continue?

patient: I was going to ask... if you think my brain’s just... short-circuiting from too many late nights. But that feels like blaming the tool for the user’s error. (pauses, rubs temples) My husband says I’m overcomplicating it, but how do you... recalibrate when the baseline feels broken?

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight right now—would you like to ask anything else before we continue?

patient: I... I think I’d like to check if we can briefly talk about my father’s situation. Not the medical details—just… how distance feels like a survival mechanism. (pauses, rubs palms together) But only if it’s relevant. I fear my mind is just… misfiring from too much caffeine and too little closure.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry. When you say 'some nights I wonder if things would just be better if I wasn't here,' can you help me understand what those thoughts look like for you right now?

patient: It’s... it’s not like I’m making a plan or anything. I just sometimes imagine waking up and the weight just... lifting. Like a faulty system shutting down. But then I think about the cookies I’m supposed to bake for Mark, and I feel like if I could just keep that routine going, maybe I’m not entirely... irreparable.

interviewer: It seems like that routine gives you a sense of purpose, even if it feels small. How has maintaining that routine been helping you cope with these feelings?

patient: It’s... it’s like keeping a machine running just to hear it hum back. The cookies aren’t really about the taste anymore—they’re this... this obligation I have to prove I can still do something right. Even if it’s just for Mark. But half the time I’m there, I’m thinking about how the edges might be burnt or how he’ll notice I’m not even trying. It’s stupid, right? Like I owe him perfect brownies to deserve not being a burden.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to maintain that routine is adding to your stress, even as it feels like an anchor. When did you first notice these feelings about your work, your energy, or your connection with Mark starting to change?

patient: It’s hard to pinpoint the exact moment... I guess I started noticing it during my last residency rotation. I told myself it was just the hours, the exhaustion. But then there was that misdiagnosis—something I’d never let slip before. After that, even the cookies feel like a pressure valve I can’t quite regulate. And my father... his health issues have been a storm I keep avoiding, like checking the weather but never leaving the house. Mark says I’m overthinking, but how do I explain that even small things feel like they’re fracturing?

interviewer: It sounds like your father’s health has become a difficult situation to confront. What would you most hope to work on in therapy right now?

patient: I... I think I want to stop feeling like I’m a system in constant repair. Not just the cookies, but... the way I avoid things, like my father’s condition. It’s like I’m afraid to check the vital signs of my own life. Maybe learning to... to not collapse under the weight of it all? But that sounds so vague. I know therapy isn’t magic, but... if I could just stop measuring myself in binary—working or broken—that might be a start.

interviewer: It sounds like confronting your father's health is a significant challenge for you. When did you first start feeling the need to avoid it?

patient: It’s... hard to trace, but I think it started long before his hospitalization. I’d always keep his health like a distant vital sign—monitoring from a text or a cold call from my mom. But when he actually *needed* me, I froze. It’s not just about his condition; it’s the fear of... of breaking down in public, I guess. Like if I let myself feel it, I’ll become some fragile thing Mark has to fix. And that’s the last thing I want to be.

interviewer: It sounds like the misdiagnosis during residency had a significant impact on you. Have you experienced episodes like this one in the past, where you felt overwhelmed or struggled with your work and mood?

patient: This might sound exaggerated, but I’ve always managed to function despite the pressure. Residency was grueling, but I told myself it was just long hours. This time... it’s different. I’m not just tired—I feel like I’m running on fumes, but even that analogy doesn’t capture how disconnected I’ve become.

interviewer: It sounds like this time feels more overwhelming than past challenges you’ve faced. Have there been other times in your life when you experienced similar feelings of being overwhelmed or struggling with your work and mood?

patient: Past challenges... I handled them by pushing harder. Residency was brutal, but I told myself it was just the job. This feels different—not just stress, but like my whole system’s trying to reboot. I know that sounds dramatic, but even the cookies I bake for Mark... they’re just motions now. No taste, no joy. Just... proof I can still follow a recipe.

interviewer: It sounds like baking for your husband used to bring purpose, but now feels like a chore. How has your relationship with him been affected by what you're going through?

patient: Mark’s been... patient, but I can see the exhaustion in him. I withdraw, and then when I do things like bake, it’s like I’m trying to prove I’m still functional. The cookies are... a way to feel like I’m not a burden, even if they’re just... motions now. But I worry I’m pushing him away with this... quiet unraveling.

interviewer: That sounds really isolating, trying to hold it all together while feeling like you're falling apart. How has your father's situation been affecting you lately?

patient: It’s... complicated. I set up alerts for his hospital updates, but I can’t bring myself to visit. I know it’s selfish, but the thought of falling apart in public... it’s like I’d be confirming everything my father ever implied about weakness. This might sound irrational, but I keep thinking if I stay distant, I can at least... function. Even if it means ignoring the storm.

interviewer: It sounds like staying distant from your father’s situation is a way to protect yourself from both his critical voice and public vulnerability. Have there been other times in your life when you felt similarly overwhelmed by emotional or professional demands, where the usual coping strategies didn’t feel enough?

patient: Residency... I used to think if I just worked harder, I could outpace everything. But this? This feels like my body and mind are sending error messages I can’t troubleshoot. Even the cookies—Mark’s favorite—is it absurd to need them to feel... seen? I know it’s not rational, but if I can’t even do that right, what else am I failing at?

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of self-criticism about these changes. Have there been other times in your life when you felt like you were failing at things that used to give you purpose or meaning?

patient: This might sound dramatic, but residency was brutal, but I could always compensate. Now, it's different—I missed that diagnosis, and it feels like my system's failing in a way I can't patch. I try to bake, but even that... it's just another task I can't get right without burning the edges.

interviewer: It sounds like avoiding your father’s situation is a way to protect yourself from both his critical voice and public vulnerability. How has this avoidance affected your sense of connection or responsibility toward him over time?

patient: This is complicated... I feel like I’m observing him from behind a glass wall, you know? I check his hospital alerts like they’re some kind of... clinical case study. It’s easier than facing the reality of needing him to *not* be fragile. But then guilt floods in—what if ignoring it makes me a worse daughter? A worse person? I keep thinking about those cookies, how I at least *try* to do that for Mark... but with my father, I just... shut down.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty in sharing these thoughts. How often have you been experiencing these feelings that things might be better if you weren't here?

patient: It’s... it’s there almost every day, like a background hum. I catch myself thinking, what if I just... disappeared? But I can’t risk leaving Mark alone. The cookies are my way of... proving I’m still here for him. Even if they’re burnt.

interviewer: It sounds like staying for Mark is an important reason you're keeping going. Are there any other things that help you feel connected or give you a sense of purpose right now?

patient: This might sound trivial, but I... I still correct my neighbor’s lawn maintenance complaints. It’s absurd, right? There’s something about mastering that—making sure the *‘slope drainage’* is ‘code-compliant’—it feels like I’m... holding onto a shred of normalcy. And the medical dramas, rewatching them... it’s not the shows, exactly. It’s the structure. The way the stories resolve. Like maybe if I dissect them enough, I’ll reverse-engineer how they don’t... fall apart. How they keep going.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing those details about finding structure in small ways. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life in the past week, and if so, do those thoughts feel like they have a plan or specific way they might happen?

patient: This might sound... clinical, but the thoughts are there, like a persistent arrhythmia you can’t recalibrate. I don’t plan it—Mark’s too alone, and I can’t risk him. It’s not a solution, just... a background hum. I keep thinking if I could just fix *myself* the way I fix systems, maybe the noise would stop. But I haven’t, you know. Not really.

interviewer: I hear how the thoughts feel persistent but not planned, and how staying for Mark is central to that. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or caffeine use recently, or used other substances to cope with these feelings?

patient: I... I suppose I’ve been relying on coffee more than usual. Three to four cups a day, sometimes black, sometimes with a little sugar—just to keep the engine running, I guess. (Pauses, hedges) If I’m being completely honest, there was a week in December where I... where I’d have a glass of wine at night. Not to get drunk, just to... quiet the static. But I stopped. It felt like another failure, you know? Like I couldn’t even manage this without botching it.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about the coffee and wine. Have you used any other substances, like prescription medications, opioids, or recreational drugs, either recently or in the past?

patient: I... there was a brief period after residency when I had a prescription for something like Xanax, but I stopped taking it. (Hedges) It felt like another thing to justify—like I needed a chemical crutch to function, and that’s... that’s not how I was raised. My father would’ve called it weakness. (Softens) I’d rather just power through, even if it means the static never truly goes away.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness about past medication use. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal products?

patient: I’m not on any prescription medications right now. (Pauses, fidgets with her sleeve) I do take... valerian root sometimes, for sleep. It’s herbal, so maybe it’s foolish, but I figure if my system’s already failing, at least it’s ‘natural’? (Soft chuckle, quickly self-corrects) Not that it works, really. I just... can’t bring myself to refill that antidepressant script from last year. It feels like admitting I can’t handle the workload. (Avoids eye contact)

interviewer: I hear how you're managing without prescribed medications. Have you noticed any periods in the past where you felt unusually energetic, restless, or needed very little sleep, even when you were stressed or exhausted?

patient: No... not really. (Pauses, fidgets) I mean, during residency there were times I’d work 36-hour shifts without sleeping, but that’s expected in medicine. Feels different—more like survival mode than... energy. Now? My system’s just running on fumes. (Softly) I can’t even force myself to stay awake for Mark’s movies anymore.

interviewer: I hear how your energy levels feel fundamentally different now. Have you noticed any experiences where things seem more real than they should, or moments where you hear or see things others don’t, even briefly?

patient: I... I don’t know if this counts, but sometimes I feel like I’m watching life through a glass wall. Like, I’ll see something—like my father’s name popping up on a hospital alert—and my chest tightens, but I can’t *feel* it fully. It’s almost like... like my brain is processing it as data instead of a person. (Pauses, avoids eye contact) I told myself it’s just exhaustion, or maybe the valerian root messing with my head. But it lingers, you know? Like part of me is here, and the other part is... elsewhere. (Softly) I keep telling myself it’s not a symptom, just survival mode.

interviewer: Do you currently have access to anything that could be used to harm yourself, like firearms, medications, or other means?

patient: I... there’s a leftover bottle of my old antidepressant in the cabinet, but I haven’t taken it. I keep telling myself I need to be functional for Mark, you know? If something happened to me, he’d have to handle everything. I’ve locked the gun in the garage since last year—after the patient incident. It’s not like I’m planning anything. It’s just... there. Like a backup power source you hope never kicks on.

interviewer: I hear how you're balancing responsibility for Mark with these persistent thoughts. Have the thoughts about things being better if you weren't here ever included a specific plan or timeframe for how that might happen?

patient: No... not a plan. It’s more like imagining a reset button that never gets pressed. The antidepressant’s still there, but I haven’t even opened the bottle. This might sound dramatic, but it’s like... if the system fails, I can’t risk Mark being the one left holding the manual. My father’s latest test results just came in—I’ve been staring at them like they’re a puzzle I’m too tired to solve.

interviewer: From what you've shared, it sounds like your depression has been building for months, affecting your work as a doctor, your sleep, and your sense of connection—with your husband, with your father, and even with simple joys like baking. You've been carrying a lot of guilt about these struggles, even as you're trying to hold things together for your son. What did I miss?

patient: I think... I haven’t mentioned how much I’m using work to avoid thinking about my father’s condition. I stay late in the hospital, but it’s not about patients—it’s about avoiding the quiet at home, where the alerts about his health keep looping in my head. The cookies are... they’re the only thing that feel like I’m still trying, even if they’re just a facade. But the fatigue—it’s not just sleep. My body feels like it’s in energy-saving mode, but my mind’s stuck on diagnostic mode. I can’t... reset.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness in sharing these struggles. Let's begin discussing next steps—would you be open to reviewing a simple safety plan to address those nights when things feel overwhelming, even if there's no active plan right now?

patient: I... suppose a plan could help, as long as it’s not about ‘fixing’ me. The gun’s locked, and I haven’t touched the antidepressant bottle—it’s just... there, like an emergency switch you hope never needs flipping. If the thoughts get louder, maybe having steps to call Mark or... the hospital’s counseling line would keep me from... freezing like I did with my father’s alerts. The cookies are a stupid thing to hold onto, but they’re a routine I can’t quite delete. This might sound self-indulgent, but... if the system crashes, I can’t be the one who makes it harder for him to keep running.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve already thought about important steps for when things feel overwhelming. Would you like to document those details, such as the contacts you mentioned and the routines that help you, as part of a safety plan?

patient: I... suppose documenting it could be a way to create structure, like a differential diagnosis list for myself. Mark’s number, the counseling line—those are the obvious ones. And maybe... writing down the cookies, since they’re the only routine that still feels like a ‘non-failure.’ But I don’t want it to become another thing I ignore, like the antidepressant refill I keep avoiding. This sounds contradictory, but having the plan might help me feel less like a system in energy-saving mode. For now.
