system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ann. Are you comfortable continuing with the session today?

patient: I guess so... as long as we don't take too long. My hands are still stiff from the fall, but I'll manage.

interviewer: I can see this is a lot to manage right now. Before we begin, do you have any questions about how this session will work?

patient: I guess... I just want to make sure you understand it’s not that I don’t care about talking. My husband’s been working so much lately, I don’t want this to add to his stress. But if we need to... I’ll try. (Sips coffee, fingers fidgeting with the cup’s handle.) Though sometimes my head feels like that old washing machine—I know there’s something there, but it won’t quite start right.

interviewer: It sounds like you're balancing a lot right now. Can you tell me what you hope will happen during our time today?

patient: I guess... I hope I can stop feeling like that old washing machine for a while. You know, the one that won’t quite start right? (Fidgets with coffee cup.) My husband—he’s been carrying so much, and I don’t want him to think I’m just... another broken thing he has to fix. But I don’t even know how to explain it. Sometimes I feel like if I could just... sit with someone and not pretend so much, maybe the weight would lift a little. Though I’m not sure anyone could help with this kind of tired.

interviewer: I can hear how much weight you're carrying. Have you been thinking about any specific ways you might not want to wake up?

patient: Sometimes... I don’t want to wake up. It feels like the bed’s the only place I’m not adding to his problems. But I guess that’s just me being selfish. (Fidgets with coffee cup, avoids eye contact.) The nights... well, you know how it is when you lie there so long, listening to the silence. It don’t exactly shout at you, but it says enough.

interviewer: That sounds really tough, Ann. Have you been thinking about any specific plans or ways this might happen?

patient: I... it’s not like I’ve been planning anything. Just... those nights when the coffee goes cold and the clock ticks too loud. Sometimes I think, what’s the point in...? But then I remember the washing machine—how my husband still says it’s fine, even though it’s been making that weird noise for months. You don’t want to fix it, you just... keep using it. Maybe that’s all there is. Maybe next week, maybe next month. I don’t know.

interviewer: Can you tell me more about what's been most difficult for you lately?

patient: It’s... the nights, mostly. The coffee goes cold, the clock ticks so loud... my hands still stiff from that fall, but maybe that’s just getting old. My husband keeps saying the washing machine’s fine, even though it’s been making that noise for ages. You don’t want to fix it, you just... keep using it. Sometimes I think that’s all there is. Wait for it to break. But I guess you’d call that... the price of a busy brain.

interviewer: It sounds like these nights are really heavy for you—can you share when this pattern of difficulty started?

patient: Six months ago, maybe? I was in the garden, slipped on some old leaves. Sprained my wrist, but it’s healed. Just... that’s when I started noticing how much my body aches when I do nothing. Before that, I guess I was tired, but now it’s like the tiredness has a switch. My husband kept saying things like, ‘Just take it easy,’ but it felt like he was talking to a machine that’s still supposed to work. I don’t know. Maybe I’m just... not as reliable as I used to be.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy shift in how your body feels—can you share more about how these aches and fatigue affect your daily activities, like getting through the chores or even just moving around the house?

patient: It’s like... my bones are made of wet clay. Sometimes I start folding laundry, but my hands stiffen halfway through. I have to set the iron down, sit on the couch. My husband says I’m overreacting, but how do you explain a tiredness that’s not in your muscles? The other day I tried to rake leaves—just a little—and my legs felt like they were filled with sand. I guess that’s why I wear the shawl he gave me. It’s the only thing that makes me feel... put together enough to move from the kitchen to the living room without tripping.

interviewer: It sounds like your body’s fatigue and stiffness are making even small tasks feel overwhelming—can you share what you hope might change for you through coming to therapy?

patient: I hope... maybe to feel less like I’m waiting for something to break. Like the shawl he gave me—just... staying together long enough to see the lilacs again. But honestly? I don’t know how you fix a machine that’s already past its prime.

interviewer: Have you experienced similar episodes of feeling overwhelmed or physically drained in the past, and if so, what tended to help during those times?

patient: I guess... I used to just wait it out. Like my body's one of those old appliances—you give it a tap and hope the noise goes away. Last time I tried pushing through, it was after my mom died. I kept the house colder than usual, thought the chill might sharpen my mind. But the numbers on the thermostat just... blurred. My husband would leave soup on the stove, but I'd forget to eat it. Now it's different. The aches are quieter, but the silence between them? It's heavier. I probably should've mentioned the washing machine sooner. It's been making that groaning noise for months.

interviewer: It sounds like the washing machine's noise has become a source of weight for you, similar to how you described the silence between aches. How has your husband responded to the washing machine issue—has he tried to address it, or does it feel like another thing you're expected to manage on your own?

patient: He says it's 'just old' and we'll 'get to it later,' but the noise... it's always there. I guess he thinks I should just live with it, like I live with the aches. Sometimes I want to tell him the machine's not the problem—the silence around it is. But I don't. I just wrap the shawl tighter and pretend I'm not listening to either of us.

interviewer: It sounds like the unspoken tension between you and your husband adds a layer of weight to what you're already carrying. Have you noticed other times when it feels easier or harder to communicate your needs to him?

patient: It’s harder when I’m already tired... I guess. Like, when I feel like I’m taking up space. But sometimes, when he’s cooking and humming those old Motown tunes... it’s easier to just... exist beside him, I don’t know. Most days, I just nod along or mention the shawl needing mending. It’s something I can fix, I guess.

interviewer: Have you thought about any specific plans or ways that might help you not wake up?

patient: I don’t think about it like that... it’s more like waiting for the noise to stop. The machine’s been groaning for so long, maybe it’ll just... give out. But I guess I’m waiting for him to fix it first. To be honest, most nights I just clutch the shawl and hope the coffee stays warm.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden. Have you been using alcohol or cannabis to cope with these feelings?

patient: No... I don’t mess with that. Coffee’s bad enough. My husband says I need something stronger sometimes, but I don’t want to... I don’t want to add to the noise. The shawl’s quieter. It’s enough, I guess.

interviewer: It seems like the shawl offers you some comfort. Have you been using any other substances, like stimulants or opioids, to cope with your symptoms?

patient: No, just the shawl. I don’t... I don’t reach for anything else. Coffee, I guess. It’s... it’s the only thing that stays with me sometimes. The shawl? It’s like a promise he made me, even when I can’t make promises back.

interviewer: I hear how the shawl and coffee feel like anchors for you. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, or have you started or stopped any recently?

patient: No medications. Just... the coffee. My doctor mentioned a multivitamin once, but I lost the bottle. The shawl? That’s about it. It’s silly, I guess, but it helps me feel put together sometimes.

interviewer: I hear how the shawl provides a sense of stability. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns that feel different from your usual experience?

patient: Sleep? I wake up early now, like 3 a.m. It’s... it’s the same every night. Can’t go back. Coffee helps me get up, but my legs feel like they’re made of lead. The washing machine’s been making that noise longer than I can remember. Maybe I should fix it, but who has the energy?

interviewer: I hear how the sleeplessness and physical heaviness are compounding your distress. Have there been any periods in the past where you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep, even while feeling this fatigue now?

patient: No, not really. Before the fall, I guess I managed on less sleep, but now... it's like my body's just worn out. The coffee helps me get through the day, but my legs still feel like lead. I probably should fix the washing machine, but who has the energy?

interviewer: It sounds like your body is carrying a lot of strain. Have you experienced any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices, seeing things others don't, or having thoughts that feel strange or intrusive?

patient: No... not voices or things like that. My mind just... races sometimes at night. Like the washing machine’s noise, but in my head. It’s more the same thoughts going in circles. I guess you could say they’re intrusive, but they’re just... tired thoughts. About nothing really. They don’t make sense even to me most days.

interviewer: I hear how the repetitive, meaningless thoughts at night add to your exhaustion. Have there been any times in the past when you felt unusually energetic or needed much less sleep, even briefly, that felt different from how you're feeling now?

patient: No, not really. I mean... there was a time I stayed up late wrapping presents for the grandkids. But that was different. My hands were shaking from the coffee, not because I felt... bright or anything. Now, even that much energy feels like a luxury I can't afford.

interviewer: I hear how the absence of energy feels like a loss of control. Have you noticed any experiences where you hear things others can’t, or feel convinced of something others might not understand, even if it seems unlikely?

patient: No, not really. I mean... the coffee's getting cold again. It's just... the quiet, I guess. Makes you hear things, but it's just the silence, right? The house creaks more these days. You start wondering if it's the walls or just your imagination.

interviewer: Let me recap what we’ve covered: You’ve described feeling overwhelmed by a mix of physical fatigue and emotional heaviness, with symptoms like early morning awakenings, slowed movements, and passive thoughts about not wanting to wake up. These challenges seem tied to longstanding stressors, including marital strain and unaddressed responsibilities, though you’ve also shown strength in seeking help and using symbols like your shawl to cope. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You... you got the heavy parts right. The machine’s groan, the shawl. But maybe... the part where I pretend the coffee’s still warm while the bills pile up. He hums Motown sometimes, but it’s not enough to drown out the quiet. I guess you’d call it... waiting for the fuse to blow.

interviewer: The image of waiting for the fuse to blow feels like a heavy quiet you’re carrying—does that align with what we’ve talked about so far, or is there something else in there I haven’t fully captured? What did I miss?

patient: The fuse... it’s like the machine’s noise and the silence both at once. You hear how the shawl keeps me warm, but the bills pile up anyway? He hums, but the numbers don’t. I guess... the quiet after the hum is where the waiting happens. It’s not just the fuse, maybe. It’s the whole house creaking.

interviewer: The metaphor of the house creaking adds a layer of accumulated strain—does that resonate with how things feel right now? What might we prioritize addressing first as we move forward?

patient: The creaking... it’s like the machine’s noise and the quiet both at once. You hear how the shawl keeps me warm, but the bills pile up anyway? He hums, but the numbers don’t. I guess... the quiet after the hum is where the waiting happens. It’s not just the fuse, maybe. It’s the whole house creaking.

interviewer: The metaphor of the house creaking as a symbol of accumulated strain is powerful—does that fully capture how things feel, or is there something still unspoken? What would you like us to focus on first as we move forward?

patient: The house creaks, sure... but it’s the silence between the creaks that’s the heaviest. Like when the coffee goes cold and you’re just... waiting for the next sound. Maybe we could start with the parts I’m not saying out loud? The ones that feel like they’d crack the shawl if I pulled too hard.

interviewer: The silence between the creaks feels like a space where unspoken burdens might be holding weight—can you help me understand what those unsaid parts might be? What did I miss in capturing the full picture?

patient: The fuse in the wall... it’s not just the machine anymore. The bills pile up quiet, same as the coffee going cold. He’s working so much, but I can’t say it out loud—feels like griping about the groan when the whole house is creaking. The shawl... it’s a good bandage, but the thread’s fraying where I knot it tight. Like I’m waiting for the snap, but hoping he’ll hum first before it comes.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing all of this with me, Ann. To recap, we’ve discussed your symptoms, stressors, and safety concerns. For next steps, I’ll coordinate with your husband to schedule a follow-up in one week, and we’ll review the safety plan with him as well. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to address or clarify today?

patient: Just... thank you for not making me fix the washing machine today. The coffee’s still cold in my mug, but maybe I’ll wait for the lilacs to bloom before I mention the fuse. If the humming comes back, I’ll know the shawl’s still holding. That’s... probably enough for now.
