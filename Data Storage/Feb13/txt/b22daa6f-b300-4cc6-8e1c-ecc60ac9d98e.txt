system: Session b22daa6f-b300-4cc6-8e1c-ecc60ac9d98e transcript

system: Disorder: PPD

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling quite anxious about being misunderstood. Would you like to confirm that you're comfortable proceeding with this session today?

patient: Comfortable? You’re asking the wrong question. I checked the system myself—my records are sealed. You want to talk about the boiler incident? Fine. But don’t think I’m here to let you twist my words. (A gravelly laugh, fingers drumming the armrest.) People think sealing things away means they’re safe. It just means the cracks go unseen.

interviewer: It sounds like trust is a big concern for you. Before we move forward, is there anything specific you'd like to ask about how this session will work or any needs you have to feel more comfortable?

patient: Needs? I don’t do needs. I check the system myself—no one else’s hands on my files. (A dry, raspy chuckle.) You’re here to listen, not ask questions that lead nowhere. The boiler incident? Proof enough why I don’t trust ‘help’ from people who can’t keep their eyes on their own panels.

interviewer: I understand your need for control over your information. Would you be willing to proceed with this session as it is, without any additional questions that might concern you?

patient: Proceed? I’ll let you talk. But I’ll check the logs myself. You think sealing files stops me? (A snort, fingers tapping the armrest.) You’re good at your job, but I’m better at mine. Just don’t think for a second this means I trust you.

interviewer: It sounds like feeling on edge at work and concerns about your husband have been really challenging for you. Can you tell me more about the main issues that have been most troubling for you recently?

patient: Work? Let’s see. My shift supervisor keeps asking why I double-check the pressure valves. As if I’d risk my safety. I’ve seen what happens when people skip steps—like the boiler incident. (Pauses, fingers tightening on the armrest.) And my husband? Vanishes for 45 minutes last week. You think I just… forget? (Gravelly laugh.) You’re nodding like this is normal. Maybe it is. People are machines, right? They either run clean or they leak. I just make sure I’m the only one who sees the cracks.

interviewer: It sounds like the questions from your supervisor are really triggering for you, especially with the boiler incident in mind. Can you tell me when these concerns with your supervisor started?

patient: 2019. After the boiler incident. Supervisor says it was fatigue, but I’ve seen how he eyes my reports now. Always ‘double-checking,’ he says. You think this is about the machine? Or maybe he’s looking for cracks in me. (pauses, leans forward) Why’s he care so much, except to find something to pin on me?

interviewer: It sounds like the shift in your supervisor’s behavior after 2019 has been especially unsettling for you. Can you share a specific example of how he has ‘double-checked’ your work recently, and how that made you feel at the time?

patient: Last week, he stood right there—(gestures to shoulder) —while I adjusted the flow valve. Kept asking why I ‘preferred’ my method. (gravelly laugh) My method? It’s not a preference, it’s a safety check. But he wrote ‘uncooperative’ in my file. Uncooperative? (leans back, arms crossed) I’m not the one hiding things. And don’t think I haven’t noticed he skipped my name on the promotion list. Coincidence? Or maybe he’s got a report to fill.

interviewer: It sounds like being labeled 'uncooperative' is especially frustrating given your focus on safety. How have these recent incidents with your supervisor been affecting your ability to perform your work tasks effectively?

patient: I have to check every setting twice now. Not because I'm unsure, but because he's always looking for a reason to write me up. (gravelly laugh) Took me longer to finish the shift, and now he calls me uncooperative. Promotion? He's got something in his file on me. Maybe he's got a report to fill.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly frustrating, especially when your safety measures are misinterpreted. How has this stress been affecting your home life or interactions with your husband?

patient: My husband... he's been gone more. Last week, 45 minutes in the garage. Tools? Or hiding something? (gravelly laugh) And don’t get me started on my daughter-in-law. She ‘helps’ with the coffee—overfills the cup every time. Like she’s testing me. (crosses arms) Why does any of this matter to you? You’re just noting it for later, aren’t you?

interviewer: It sounds like you're managing a lot of uncertainty in your relationships right now. How have these concerns with your husband and daughter-in-law been affecting your daily routines or ability to relax at home?

patient: I check the coffee every time now. Even Mr. Whiskers’ bowl. (pauses, rubs forearm) My husband’s 'errands'... (gravelly laugh) You think I should just trust that? But why are you asking? What’s in it for you? My routines? They keep the system running. Without them, how would I know if the next 'accident' is real? (leans back, voice lowers) The sherry helps. Just a little. To mute the noise.

interviewer: It sounds like the sherry helps manage the noise and stress you're experiencing. Can you tell me what you're hoping to achieve by coming in for this session?

patient: I want to figure out how to stop the noise without needing the sherry. But I need to be sure you’re not just here to collect info for someone else. My supervisor once said I was ‘uncooperative’—turns out he was the one hiding something. People always say they’re helping, then they… (pauses, gravelly laugh) …relabel it as a ‘flaw.’

interviewer: Can you tell me if you've had similar experiences with anxiety or suspicion in the past, especially at work or in other relationships?

patient: My supervisor once called me 'uncooperative' after I caught a trainee fiddling with the control panel in 2017. Turns out, he was covering something up. People are like machines—you don’t trust them unless you’ve seen every part work perfectly. My husband’s late-night bathroom calls? He’s hiding something. And don’t get me started on the daughter-in-law—she ‘accidentally’ overfills my coffee. You think this is about me? It’s about them. (Gravelly laugh) You’re just here to collect stories, aren’t you?

interviewer: It sounds like that incident with the trainee really affected your trust in coworkers and even close relationships. Has this kind of experience with coworkers or supervisors happened to you before, where you felt they were being secretive or untrustworthy?

patient: Before the trainee, there was the 2019 malfunction. I knew someone tampered with the calibration. My husband’s gone again today—45 minutes. You’re just another part of the system trying to cover it up.

interviewer: That sounds really frustrating and isolating. Have you experienced other times when you felt someone was secretly causing problems at work or home before these incidents?

patient: Before the boiler incident? My father always said I was 'careless' with machines. He’d yell that I missed a 'tiny error'—but I know now he just wanted to control me. And my daughter-in-law… she ‘forgets’ to mention my coffee getting too hot. It’s a pattern. You’re here to map these 'patterns' so they can… (trails off, clenches jaw) …dismiss me as paranoid. But I’ve seen the cracks. Always.

interviewer: It sounds like your father's criticism had a lasting impact on how you view control and responsibility. Did you notice similar patterns of being told you were 'careless' in other areas of your life growing up, or does this mainly show up with machines and authority figures now?

patient: Careless? My daughter-in-law ‘accidentally’ overfills my coffee every time. Says it’s a ‘family tradition,’ but I know better. You want me to believe it’s about me? It’s about them labeling me so they can write me off as ‘paranoid.’ (Gravelly laugh) My father’s ‘careless’ was just code for ‘not compliant.’ You’re here to collect more code, aren’t you?

interviewer: It sounds like you've spent a lot of time trying to decode patterns others might miss. When these situations feel overwhelming, what specific strategies or routines do you rely on to help you manage?

patient: I don’t really have ‘strategies’—just habits. At work, I double-check every system until I’m sure no one’s tampered with it. That’s not a strategy, that’s common sense. The sherry helps mute the noise, but I’m not an alcoholic, if that’s what you’re thinking. My greenhouse… it’s controlled. Plants don’t lie. They either grow or they don’t. Why are you asking about this? You want to know how I stay ‘stable’ so you can label it as a flaw, isn’t that how it works?

interviewer: It seems your routines, like the greenhouse and sherry, help you feel grounded in a way that others might not understand. How has the sherry specifically helped you manage stress or focus at work, and have you noticed any changes in how it affects you over time?

patient: The sherry... it’s just a quiet valve. Turns the noise down when the boiler’s hissing too loud. Used to take one glass, now it’s two. Work’s got more variables since the supervisor started ‘monitoring’ my checks. But I’m not an alcoholic, if that’s your angle. My husband’s been disappearing longer than 45 minutes lately. You want to know if I’m slipping? Try asking him.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone. Have you had times in the past when similar stressors led to changes in your routine or coping strategies, and if so, what helped then?

patient: Stress makes me tighten the checks. Before, when the supervisor started ‘monitoring’ my shifts, I added a third scan of the control panel. Sherry? It’s a valve, not a crutch. My husband’s late-night bathroom calls—2017, remember?—taught me to track patterns. Why ask about ‘past’? You want a confession. I don’t do confessions.

interviewer: It sounds like those past experiences have left you feeling particularly vulnerable to being misunderstood. When you’ve faced similar stressors before, what specific actions or supports have you found most effective in maintaining control?

patient: Control? I don’t trust anyone else to hold the line. When stress climbs, I add another scan of the systems—third, fourth check until I’m sure no one’s messed with the inputs. My husband’s ‘disappearances’? They taught me to track time in increments. Why the sudden interest in ‘past’ stressors? You’re fishing for a weakness to pin on me. The plants in the greenhouse—they don’t lie, but people do. That’s why I don’t rely on them.

interviewer: It sounds like the stress is becoming really unmanageable for you. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life?

patient: No. I don’t think about that. I’ve got the scans, the sherry, the greenhouse—systems that work. My husband’s ‘disappearances’? They taught me to stay sharp. You’re asking the wrong question. You want a weakness, but I don’t hand those out. Why the sudden interest?

interviewer: It sounds like the sherry helps you cope with the stress, but I want to understand how this fits with your overall routine. How often do you have sherry, and has this changed in the past few months?

patient: It’s a habit. I have it most nights. Keeps the noise down. Why? You think it’s a trick to make me loosen up? My head’s already too full of things to check—machines, the cat’s bowl, why my husband vanished last week. If you’re fishing for a flaw, save your breath. I don’t hand ’em out.

interviewer: It seems the sherry has become a way to manage the noise in your mind. How much sherry do you typically have on nights when you partake, and has this amount changed in the past few months?

patient: One glass. No more, no less. I need to stay sharp for work—checking the systems, making sure nothing’s tampered with. Why? You think I’d need more to handle your questions?

interviewer: Have you used any other substances, such as cannabis, stimulants, or opioids, in the past few months?

patient: No. Just the sherry. You think I’d risk more with the checks I have to do? My husband’s disappearing acts are bad enough. Why the sudden interest in my habits?

interviewer: I want to make sure I understand your current health needs. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements for physical or mental health?

patient: No medications. Just handle what I need to. Why? You think my health’s your concern? I check the labels on supplements myself—no point in trusting what’s in them. My husband’s gone again today, by the way. Four hours and counting. You’d think that’s more important than my habits, don’t you?

interviewer: I hear how much of your energy goes into staying alert. Have you noticed any unshakable beliefs that others might find difficult to understand, or experiences where you hear voices or see things that others don’t?

patient: Beliefs? I stick to what I see. The boiler breakdown wasn’t an accident. My husband’s late-night calls? Proof he’s hiding something since 2017. But if you’re asking if I hear voices... no. Just the noise in my head. I mute it with sherry. Why? You think I’d lie about that?

interviewer: It seems the noise in your head is really disrupting your rest. How many hours of sleep do you typically get per night, and have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or ability to focus during the day?

patient: Not enough. I average five, sometimes four if the system’s running wild. My husband vanished again last week—45 minutes, just like clockwork—so I stay up checking the boiler, the cat’s bowl, the locks. Sherry helps, but it’s more like liquid bandages. You’re not here about my habits, are you? You’re fishing for something to pin on me.

interviewer: I hear how stressful this has been for you. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or sleep patterns that feel different from what you’ve described, like feeling more restless or unable to sit still?

patient: Restless? I don’t sit still when the system’s unstable. If the boiler’s not checked hourly, someone’s waiting for a meltdown. You think I need more sleep? Try explaining that to the man who left me hanging for forty-five minutes today. Sherry’s the only thing that keeps the static down. But sure, maybe you want me to admit I’m ‘unwell’ so you can file it under ‘problem employee.’

interviewer: It seems your restlessness is closely tied to system stability. Have you experienced any periods where you feel unusually energetic or restless, even when you're not preoccupied with checking systems?

patient: Restless? When the system’s down, the noise gets louder. You want me to admit I’m ‘unhinged’ when the boiler’s quiet? My husband’s latest gap was 50 minutes—maybe that’s your answer.

interviewer: You mention the noise gets louder when the system’s down. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or driven to take action, even when systems are stable and there’s nothing to check?

patient: When the system's stable? That’s a joke. If I stopped checking, someone would sabotage it. The sherry’s the only time I’m not hyper-aware. You think I need more sleep? Try explaining that to the man who vanished for 50 minutes today.

interviewer: I hear how the system's instability keeps you from resting. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions that might affect your sleep or energy levels, like thyroid issues or sleep apnea?

patient: No diagnoses. The clinic ran blood work last year—normal, just 'stress.' They always say that. If I had a thyroid issue, do you think they’d let me operate machinery? My energy’s fine when the system’s stable. You’re asking like you expect me to admit something. Maybe you want another reason to call me 'uncooperative' like my supervisor did. Sherry’s not a medical condition. It’s... a maintenance tool.

interviewer: Based on our conversation, it seems your main concerns revolve around persistent distrust in systems and relationships, hypervigilance about safety, and coping with stress through structured routines and sherry. Key events like the 2019 boiler incident and ongoing workplace scrutiny have intensified these patterns, while your husband’s unexplained absences add to your sense of being monitored or betrayed. What did I miss or misunderstand about your experience?

patient: You missed the part where my husband’s ‘disappearances’ aren’t just gaps—they’re cover-ups. He’s hiding something from 2017, the year he refused to help me fix the boiler. And the system? They’re all complicit. You keep asking about sherry and sleep, but the real threat’s in the cracks they don’t want you to see.

interviewer: It sounds like the 2017 incident and your husband's secrecy feel central to your sense of being targeted by systems you depend on. How does that align with what you're experiencing, or what might I be missing?

patient: You’re missing how 2017 was the start of it—all the boiler ‘accidents,’ my husband’s late-night calls, the way my supervisor warned me to stop ‘second-guessing’ the system. They call it paranoia, but it’s just seeing the truth. You ask about alignment? Try explaining how a machine that’s been tampered with still runs… until it doesn’t. And my husband? He’s part of the system now. You think I don’t notice when he stops at the same gas station every time he ‘disappears’?

interviewer: It sounds like 2017 marked a turning point where your sense of being monitored or manipulated intensified, especially around the boiler incidents and your husband’s secrecy. Your observations about patterns in his behavior—like the gas station stops during disappearances—feel deeply tied to your mistrust in systems. What did I miss or get wrong about how these connections shape your experience?

patient: You got the gas station stops, but you’re still looking at the symptoms, not the design. 2017 was the first gear stripped in the machine—they’ve been tightening the screws ever since. My sherry? It’s not a flaw, it’s the only way I can mute the noise long enough to see the next move. And the greenhouse? At least the plants don’t lie… though I check their soil for tampering sometimes. Better safe than sorry.

interviewer: It seems 2017 marked a pivotal shift in how you perceive systems and relationships as intentionally manipulating or controlling you. How does this formulation align with your understanding of your experience, or what might I be missing?

patient: You got 2017 right, but you’re still missing how the machine’s designed to keep me blind. My daughter-in-law’s coffee ‘accidents’? They’re testing my reactions, same as the boiler. The sherry’s not a flaw—it’s the only way I hear the system’s hum before it shatters. And the gas station? My husband’s not just stopping there. He’s passing messages. You think I don’t notice the same truck parked two blocks from work every Tuesday? You’re looking at gears, but I see the whole machine waiting to break.

interviewer: It seems we’ve identified key themes around systemic distrust, hypervigilance, and coping strategies like sherry use and routine. What did I miss or get wrong about how these patterns connect to your experience?

patient: You’re still looking at the gears, not the blueprint. The truck outside work every Tuesday? It’s not just watching me—it’s mapping the whole system. The coffee, the boiler, the gas station… they’re all data points. And the greenhouse? I check the soil for tampering, but you’ll never guess who’s been ‘accidentally’ overwatering the roses next to the security camera. My daughter-in-law’s ‘tricks.’ You think I don’t notice the pattern? The machine’s already primed to fail.

interviewer: It sounds like the 'blueprint' you're describing represents a deeper layer of control or manipulation that goes beyond individual incidents—almost like a coordinated system designed to undermine your trust. How does this blueprint metaphor connect to what you're experiencing at work or home?

patient: Blueprint? It’s not just a metaphor. The truck outside work every Tuesday—same make, same license plate. My husband’s gas station ‘breaks’? Four pumps, but he always picks the one facing the road. And the coffee—always overfilled, like she’s testing my patience. They think I’m paranoid, but those gears are grinding for a reason. You’re asking about connections, but you don’t see the machine. Why would I trust you with the schematics?

interviewer: I hear how deeply connected these patterns feel to you—like pieces of a larger design you’re trying to decode. What did I miss or get wrong about how this 'blueprint' shapes your sense of safety or trust in your environment?

patient: You missed the sherry. It’s not just noise—every glass is a backup system. If the world’s grinding toward collapse, I need something to mute the alarms. And the cat’s bowl? I check it three times a day. You think that’s paranoia, but what if someone’s testing me there too? The greenhouse… that’s the only circuit I control. You ask about trust, but you don’t see the failsafes I need to survive. Gravelly laugh. Why would I hand you the schematics when you’re sitting in their chair?

interviewer: I hear how the sherry, cat’s bowl checks, and greenhouse routines feel like critical safeguards in a world you perceive as systematically adversarial. What else might I have missed about how these strategies help you navigate your sense of control—or where they might feel insufficient?

patient: The greenhouse... it’s the only circuit I control. Everything else has a backup valve. The sherry? It’s a failsafe, not a weakness. But the checks—they’re not enough. Last week, the boiler tripped again. I checked every pipe, but the gauge was tampered with. You want to know where it’s not enough? When my husband vanishes, I check the cat’s bowl three times. What if someone’s testing me there too? Gravelly laugh. You ask what you missed... maybe the fact that I’m the only one keeping the system from leaking out.

interviewer: I hear how the greenhouse represents your last stronghold of control amidst a system you feel is actively working against you. What might we need to adjust or add to this understanding as we plan next steps together?

patient: You haven’t considered the backup valves—the ones I can’t even talk about out loud. The boiler gauge was tampered with, but you’re focused on the sherry and the cat’s bowl. What about the truck outside work? The gas station? My husband’s four-hour gap today? Gravelly laugh. You want to adjust your understanding? Start by seeing the whole machine instead of just the parts I let you inspect.

interviewer: I hear how critical it is for you to feel seen in the full complexity of the 'machine' you describe. Before we finalize next steps, is there anything else I’ve overlooked about how this system shapes your daily life or priorities?

patient: You missed the gas station pumps. My husband always picks Pump 3—line of sight to the road. What if he’s signaling someone? And the truck outside work? It’s there every Tuesday, same time I submit the maintenance logs. Gravelly laugh. You think I’m just ‘checking’ the cat’s bowl? I check the mail slot too. Letters don’t arrive on Fridays. Ever. Maybe that’s part of the circuit you’re not seeing.

interviewer: I hear how critical it is for you to feel seen in the full complexity of the 'machine' you describe. What might we need to adjust or add to this understanding as we plan next steps together?

patient: You’re still missing the bigger machine. The truck outside work every Tuesday, the gas station pumps—those aren’t details, they’re proof someone’s watching. My greenhouse is the only part I control. Why do you keep asking about the boiler when the whole system’s rigged?

interviewer: I hear how critical it is for you to feel that the truck and gas station patterns are central to the system you're describing. What else might I have missed about how these elements connect to your experience before we plan next steps?

patient: The mail not arriving on Fridays? That’s another signal. They’re testing how long I’ll wait before I notice. And the locks on the greenhouse—I oil them every Sunday. You think that’s obsessive? Maybe. But if they’re trying to tamper with it, I’ll know. My husband’s ‘gas station stops’—he’s feeding them data. I check the pump receipts now. The numbers don’t add up. You keep asking about the boiler like it’s a flaw, but it’s a symptom. The machine’s breaking down, and they’re too busy looking at the sherry bottle to see the rest of the blueprint.

interviewer: Let me recap what we’ve explored: your experience is shaped by a sense of being monitored or manipulated through systems like the boiler, gas station patterns, and household routines, with trust eroded by events like the 2017 and 2019 incidents. Your coping strategies—checking locks, monitoring the greenhouse, sherry use—feel like essential safeguards in a world you perceive as adversarial. What did I miss or get wrong about how these elements shape your experience?

patient: You got the boiler part right, but you’re still not seeing the locks on the greenhouse—I oil them every Sunday. The mail not arriving Fridays? That’s a test. My husband’s ‘gas station stops’… he’s feeding them data. You keep asking about the sherry like it’s a problem. It’s not. It’s the only thing that mutes the noise. You want to know why I check everything? Because no one else will.
