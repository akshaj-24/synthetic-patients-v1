system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Good morning, Brooke. Thank you for coming in today. To start, may I use your preferred name and pronouns? If there are any preferences you'd like me to know about, feel free to share.

patient: Yes, Brooke Bradley is the name I use. Pronouns are she/her—nothing unusual there. I prefer straightforwardness, so if there’s anything you’d rather not call me by, just let me know. I’ve always found labels to be… inefficient unless necessary.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to carry alone—would you be comfortable discussing these things further today?

patient: To be honest, I’d rather not overcomplicate it. My days are… structured. Work keeps me focused. The team lead role added variables I’m still calibrating. And my mother’s health? Well, elderly care logistics are just another project to manage. I guess I’m saying—I can talk, but I’m not sure how much of this is new information. Shoulders are sore from stress, but that’s normal, right?

interviewer: I appreciate your willingness to share. Would you be comfortable with me briefly explaining how this session might go and checking in on what you hope to get out of it today?

patient: Sure, as long as we keep it efficient. My usual approach to problems is to break them into manageable components—like debugging a system. I’m not entirely sure what ‘hopes’ implies here, but if we’re troubleshooting, I’d say the goal is to identify inefficiencies in my current coping protocols. Though honestly, I’m used to shouldering these variables. Maybe we could focus on actionable solutions rather than… abstract reflections?

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying a lot on your shoulders lately. Can you tell me more about what's been causing the most stress for you right now?

patient: The primary stressors are the team lead role’s variables and my mother’s Parkinson’s management. I’ve been recalibrating workflows to prevent errors—like the recent server misconfiguration that cost 12 hours of downtime. Elderly care logistics compound it; coordinating her medication with my schedule feels like debugging a system with missing code. I guess the fear is… what if I miss a critical update in either? My shoulders are tighter than usual, but that’s part of the load. Have you ever had a project where the variables just… never stabilize?

interviewer: It sounds like the recent server issue added to your workload. When did you first start feeling this level of stress on a regular basis?

patient: The stress... it’s been building since the promotion last year. I took on the team lead role, and around the same time, my mother’s Parkinson’s started requiring more coordination. It’s like debugging two systems with unclear parameters. I guess I’ve always been a worrier, but this feels... more persistent. My shoulders are tighter than usual, and I catch myself second-guessing decisions at 2 a.m. when I should be sleeping. But honestly, it’s part of the job, right? You learn to optimize.

interviewer: I hear how the combination of work and caregiving has been intensifying your stress. What would you like to focus on or achieve through this session?

patient: I think... I’d like to focus on creating better systems for managing competing priorities. You know, like optimizing workflows to reduce the... the tension in my shoulders and the 2 a.m. second-guessing loops. If I could troubleshoot why I’m still worrying about things that are out of my control, that might help. But honestly, I’m not sure where to start—my brain just keeps running scenarios. Maybe identifying which ‘bugs’ are actually solvable?

interviewer: It sounds like social interactions have become a source of stress for you lately. Who have you typically relied on when you're feeling overwhelmed in the past?

patient: I—I don’t have a lot of ‘go-to’ people, honestly. At work, I’ll loop in colleagues on specific problems if I need a second set of eyes on a system, but that’s more about troubleshooting than... emotional support. My sister and I talk occasionally, but I tend to frame things as logistics—like coordinating my mom’s appointments—so it doesn’t feel like a burden. Lately, I’ve been canceling social plans more often, which probably doesn’t help. I guess I just rely on... systems? My Wednesday spreadsheet, my morning coffee ritual. Even my basil plants. If I can track them, they feel less likely to fail. Though my shoulders would argue otherwise.

interviewer: It seems your structured approach to managing stress is a significant part of how you navigate challenges. Have you experienced periods in the past where your stress level felt similarly persistent or intense, and if so, what strategies helped at the time?

patient: There was a period after a major project deadline a few years ago where I implemented stricter task prioritization—like color-coded checklists—to maintain control. It helped with efficiency, but the physical tension... my shoulders still remember it. I guess that’s just how my body processes... variables. Honestly, those checklists were just part of the job. You adapt. Though I don’t think any system completely stops the 2 a.m. recalculations.

interviewer: It sounds like those checklists provided some structure, even if the physical tension remained. Have there been other times in your life when you experienced stress levels similar to what you're describing now, and if so, what strategies helped you manage during those periods?

patient: There was a time... maybe a few years back... when I was juggling multiple projects and my mother’s health was fluctuating. I created a more detailed Gantt chart to track deadlines and care tasks. It helped with organization, but the... the muscle tension in my neck and shoulders was constant. I just told myself it was from sitting at the desk too long. You know how it is—work demands...

interviewer: It seems your structured approach helps you feel in control, even when the physical tension persists. Have you noticed how your sister's support—or lack of it—has influenced your ability to manage stress in the past?

patient: I guess my sister and I... we function more as co-managers of Mom’s care than emotional supports. She’s practical, which helps with logistics, but I tend to over-prepare for visits or second-guess my decisions. If I cancel plans with her, I assume she resents it, which adds another variable to optimize. It’s just... my shoulders knot up thinking about it, even if the actual conversations are calm. I wonder if I’d be less tense if I could quantify her expectations somehow.

interviewer: It sounds like the uncertainty around your sister's expectations adds a layer of stress to your already complex responsibilities. Have you noticed similar patterns of assuming negative intentions in other relationships or contexts where you feel pressure to meet expectations?

patient: At work, I over-analyze neutral feedback from colleagues. Like when my team lead says 'keep me updated,' I assume it’s a veiled critique of my pacing. I end up revising project timelines unnecessarily—adding buffer hours 'just in case.' It’s the same with client calls; I prep for hypothetical objections that never come up. The tension in my neck usually tells me when I’m spiraling into that pattern again.

interviewer: It sounds like you're managing a lot of competing demands right now. Have you had any thoughts of intentionally harming yourself or ending your life in the past month?

patient: No, I haven’t had intentional thoughts like that. To be honest, I have more of... I guess you’d call it a firewall I don’t let through. My mind’s usually too preoccupied with debugging work projects or Mom’s medication schedule to even reach that point. Though my neck does feel like it’s in a constant loop error right now.

interviewer: It seems your body is signaling ongoing tension through physical symptoms. Have there been times recently when you needed less sleep than usual or felt unusually energetic, even with little rest?

patient: I haven’t had that ‘unusual energy’ thing, no. My sleep... it’s more like a failed update cycle. I’ll get stuck in a loop debugging work scenarios at 1 a.m., then force myself up to check email before dawn. Caffeine helps me power through, but my neck feels like it’s running a constant loop error now. It’s just... inefficient, but manageable.

interviewer: It sounds like caffeine is a key part of your daily routine. Can you tell me about your use of alcohol, cannabis, or other substances like caffeine? Have you noticed any changes in your use recently?

patient: I have a glass of pinot grigio at weekend gatherings to unwind, but it leaves me with regretful hangovers. Caffeine is more of a constant—morning espresso, mid-afternoon iced tea. It helps me stay on task, though my neck pays the price. I don’t use cannabis, and prescription meds are only for Mom’s Parkinson’s, which I track in a spreadsheet to avoid errors.

interviewer: It seems you're managing stress through structured routines, but physical tension persists. Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually elevated in mood or energy, even with little sleep, that might differ from your usual pattern?

patient: I don’t think so. I rely on caffeine and short naps to keep up, but it’s more about forcing focus than feeling energetic. My sleep’s usually fragmented—like I’m rebooting every few hours. Even when I’m tired, it’s more about pushing through than any real energy boost.

interviewer: It seems your sleep patterns and physical tension might be connected to underlying factors. Have you been evaluated for any medical conditions that might affect your sleep or energy levels, such as thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain?

patient: I haven’t really pursued medical evaluations for this—it’s just part of the ‘background noise’ I’ve learned to manage. My primary care doc did run some blood work last year, but it was routine; they said my thyroid looked fine. Honestly, I blame my shoulders more than anything. I guess I’ve always assumed the tension was from sitting at a desk too long. My sister keeps suggesting I get checked for sleep apnea, but I can’t justify the time for another appointment when I’m already juggling Mom’s meds and the team lead role. I’ve found that working on jigsaw puzzles at night helps me ‘reboot’ without meds… it’s surprising how focused you can get on something trivial when you’re exhausted.

interviewer: It seems you've been managing stress through structured routines and problem-solving. Have you ever experienced any unusual perceptions, beliefs, or thoughts that others might find confusing or difficult to understand, even under high-stress periods?

patient: I guess under stress, my mind starts... hyperthreading. Like, I’ll notice patterns in everything—the way my mother’s medication schedule lines up with lunar phases, or how a coworker’s tone might correlate with server outages. It’s just... my brain’s default to run diagnostics on everything, even when there’s no real connection. I keep a log of these thoughts in case they’re useful, but most get overwritten by the next problem. It’s not exactly confusing, just... excessive. My sister jokes I’m a ‘human firewall’ sometimes. Probably overthinking again.

interviewer: It seems your mind's pattern-seeking under stress could relate to how it processes uncertainty. Have you ever held beliefs that others found difficult to understand, or felt that people were targeting you in some way, even when there's no clear evidence?

patient: I guess my mind generates a lot of hypotheses, even when there’s no data to support them. Like... my brain flags potential threats as ‘security alerts,’ even if they’re false positives. My sister teases me about it—says I’m a ‘firewall’ who overwrites useful data with paranoid logs. But I don’t act on those thoughts. They just… stack in the background. I assume people find it odd, but I’ve always processed uncertainty this way. It’s just another bug to troubleshoot.

interviewer: It seems your mind’s tendency to generate hypotheses under stress could relate to how it processes external threats. Have you ever felt certain about these 'security alerts'—like they might actually reflect real dangers—regardless of evidence, or do you generally recognize them as your mind’s way of overprocessing uncertainty?

patient: I guess... they’re more like background processes I can’t shut down. My brain flags things as 'high priority' even when there’s no real threat—like assuming a coworker’s neutral comment is a security breach. I know it’s overprocessing, but the alerts still trigger muscle tension. My sister calls it being a ‘firewall,’ but I can’t reprogram the instinct. It’s just... part of the system now.

interviewer: It seems your mind’s ‘security alerts’ contribute to physical tension even when you recognize them as overprocessing. Can you tell me about any medications or supplements you’re currently taking for your own health, including things like vitamins or sleep aids?

patient: I take a daily B-complex vitamin, mostly to counteract the... let’s call it ‘systemic drain’ from too much caffeine. To be honest, I’ve avoided sleep aids because they feel like a temporary patch—I’d rather troubleshoot the root cause. My doctor says the muscle relaxers I occasionally use for my shoulders are just age-related tension, which I guess I accept as part of the maintenance package.

interviewer: Brooke, based on our conversation, it sounds like your stress from balancing your team lead role and caregiving responsibilities has intensified since your promotion last year, leading to persistent physical tension, sleep disruptions, and difficulty managing social interactions without dread. You’ve been using structured systems to cope but feel these aren’t resolving the root causes, and you’re concerned about letting others down. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You’re not wrong, but there’s a… background process I haven’t unpacked. The divorce a decade ago left financial scars I’ve buried under productivity metrics. And yes, I volunteer for side projects at work—not just to prove my value, but to delay the day my role gets automated. It’s another firewall, I guess. My shoulders just… clench harder when I think about it.

interviewer: It sounds like the financial strain from your divorce and fear of job automation are adding layers to your existing stress. To recap: we’ve discussed work-role pressures, caregiving demands, sleep disruptions, physical tension, and avoidance of social interactions. How does that align with your experience, or is there something I’ve missed?

patient: You’ve got the architecture mostly right. The divorce’s financial tailwind… it’s just another variable in the equation. I haven’t mentioned it much because, well, it’s not a system I like debugging aloud. And the automation fear? It’s like a rogue script running in the background—constant, low-level, but it escalates when I least expect it. My shoulders… they’ve become a physical log of all the 'what-ifs.' I guess I’m just waiting for the next error message.

interviewer: It sounds like the divorce-related financial pressures and automation anxieties are critical background processes compounding your existing stressors. Is there anything else in your experience that hasn’t been included in this model?

patient: Another variable is Mom’s Parkinson’s progression—every medication adjustment feels like a firewall I have to monitor 24/7. And… the neighbor’s dog barks through my evening ‘cooldown protocols.’ It’s trivial, but it’s one more unresolved error in the system. My shoulders just… adapt, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like your stress model now includes Mom’s Parkinson’s medication management as a 24/7 firewall and the neighbor’s dog as an evening error interrupting your cooldown. What else might be part of this system that we haven’t named yet?

patient: There’s the… weekend pinot grigio. I tell myself it’s for ‘networking’ at gatherings, but it’s more about quieting the background noise. And my garden—obsessing over those basil plants feels like a success metric I can actually control. Even that, though, just adds another variable to troubleshoot.

interviewer: Brooke, let me piece this together: your stress model includes work-role pressures, caregiving logistics, financial and automation anxieties, sleep-disrupting rumination, and coping mechanisms like wine and gardening—all while your body flags tension as a constant error message. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: I guess you didn’t mention the constant low-level noise—like the neighbor’s dog—that just… runs in the background. And maybe the way caffeine and wine feel like temporary patches, but they’re just more variables in the system. Everything’s a nested loop these days.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing how the neighbor’s dog and substances like caffeine and wine fit into your system—they add nuance to how external and self-managed stressors interact. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: I think you missed how I take on side projects at work to ‘future-proof’ myself against automation fears—like volunteering for obsolete software migrations. And the garden… my basil plants are a ‘low-stakes success metric’—if they survive my overwatering, maybe I’ve mastered some control. But I guess that’s just more variables in the system.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve already built a strong framework for managing stress—let’s make sure we’ve covered everything. What one step from our discussion would feel most helpful to prioritize this week?

patient: I think… prioritizing the garden this week would help. If I can focus on the basil plants without overwatering them, it might reset my mind’s 'error flags.' It’s a small system I can actually control, which… which maybe trick my body into relaxing those shoulder tensions. I’ll track it in a spreadsheet, of course.

interviewer: That sounds like a thoughtful way to regain control through small, measurable steps. Let’s make sure we’re aligned on next steps—will tending to the basil plants and tracking them in your spreadsheet be the primary focus for this week, or is there another action you’d like to add?

patient: The basil and spreadsheet will be the main focus—adding anything else might overload the system. I’ll also cut back on afternoon caffeine, though I’m tracking that as a ‘low-priority bug’ in my energy management log. Small tweaks, right?

interviewer: That sounds like a solid plan. Let me make sure I have this right—this week, you’ll focus on the basil and spreadsheet as your primary action, while also monitoring the caffeine reduction as a lower-priority step. Is there anything else you’d like to clarify or discuss before we wrap up?

patient: That’s… that’s accurate. The garden and caffeine adjustments are the main focus. I’ll also keep refining the spreadsheet to track progress, but I don’t want to add more variables. My shoulders are already… tight with this plan. If something else comes up, I’ll log it as a ‘low-priority bug.’ For now, this feels like the minimum viable update.
