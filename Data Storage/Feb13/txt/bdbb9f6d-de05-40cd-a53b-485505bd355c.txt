system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Hello Joshua, my name is Jacob Wiley, and I'll be conducting this session with you today. To start, would you be comfortable with me using your name, and do you have any pronoun preferences I should be aware of?

patient: Yes, Joshua Avila is fine. Just Joshua, please. No pronoun preferences—though I imagine that’s a safer question than asking about my laundry situation these days. My washing machine’s been broken for three days, and I still haven’t fixed it. Classic me, catastrophizing a coffee stain.

interviewer: It sounds like the washing machine situation is adding to your stress right now. Would you be comfortable continuing with this session to explore what's been going on for you?

patient: Sure, I mean… it’s not like I’ve got a better offer. (pauses, rubs neck) The machine’s just… another thing I should’ve fixed sooner. It’s not *big*, right? But it’s there, humming in the background like that freelance project I botched. Clara’s been understanding, but I can see the tension in her眉间—like she’s waiting for the next thing I’ll drop. (quick laugh) Guess I’m just practiced at turning small cracks into avalanches.

interviewer: It sounds like carrying all these worries around can feel really heavy. Before we move forward, do you have any questions about what this session will involve or how it might go?

patient: Honestly? I’m just… used to overpreparing. Like, if I’d known you’d ask that, I’d have brought a checklist. (pauses, fingers tapping the armrest) It’s not that I don’t trust the process—though I can’t help but wonder if I’m doing this right. Clara says these things take time, but time’s the one thing I keep… mismanaging. (soft, bitter laugh) Let’s just say I’ll take the next hour as a learning experience. If nothing else, I’ll finally fix that washing machine in my head.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure you're under is really affecting both your work and personal life. Can you tell me more about when these feelings of anxiety and overwhelm first started for you?

patient: It’s hard to pinpoint a ‘start’—it’s felt like part of the furniture for so long. Maybe adolescence? I remember my mom always saying ‘busier is better,’ so I learned to pack every hour with… something. Projects, obligations, anything to prove I wasn’t ‘lazy.’ (pauses, rubs temples) But it’s not just work. Clara’s migraines lately? I keep… recalculating. Like, if I’d done X or changed Y, would she be okay? (soft, bitter laugh) My brain’s a spreadsheet that won’t stop adding columns. You ever try coloring inside lines that aren’t there? That’s me. Just… better at faking the calm than actually having it.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to control everything, which must be incredibly exhausting. What are you hoping to achieve through coming here today?

patient: I guess I want to... stop coloring outside the lines, but the problem is the lines keep moving. Like the washing machine—fixing it felt like a victory, but then I just move on to the next thing that’s 'broken.' It’s not that I think I’m failing, it’s more like... my brain won’t let me relax even when I’m done. If I could just stop calculating every worst-case scenario before it happens, maybe I’d have energy left for anything else. But don’t get me wrong, I’m sure you’ll tell me it’s all connected to my childhood or something.

interviewer: It sounds like you're trapped in a cycle where solving one problem just leads to another, which must be draining. Can you share a recent example of this pattern—when you fixed something but immediately moved on to the next worry?

patient: The washing machine thing? Yeah, I fixed it, but by the time I got the damn thing running again, I was already stressing about Clara’s migraines—what if I missed some ‘sign’ they’re getting worse? Then, of course, I start second-guessing that missed freelance deadline… my hands still twitch a little when I think about it. It’s like I’m stuck in this… spiral where every ‘victory’ just fuels the next thing. But you know, maybe if I just add one more column to the spreadsheet, I can finally catch up?

interviewer: It sounds like this cycle of worry leaves you physically tense even after resolving things. How often do you notice physical symptoms like twitching hands or shoulder knots when you're in the middle of these spirals?

patient: Constant. Like static you can’t mute. My shoulders are always knotted—probably why I drink more coffee than makes sense—and the twitching? Yeah, that’s there even when I’m ‘relaxing.’ It’s just… background noise now. I tell myself it’s ‘normal’ stress, but my hands still shake when I try to sketch Clara’s gallery layout. I guess I’m just… used to it by now. Classic me, turning laundry into a crisis.

interviewer: Have you experienced episodes like this before, where worries feel overwhelming and affect your daily life?

patient: It’s less ‘episodes’ and more… static that won’t shut off. Like last week, I spent hours reorganizing my sketch files ‘just in case’ the client wanted changes—I’m sure you’ve heard that one before. My hands were shaking so bad when I tried to redraw the gallery layout that Clara laughed and called me ‘the human equivalent of a buffering Netflix stream.’ But at night? I just lie there, mentally debugging every choice I’ve made since… I don’t know, breakfast. It’s not dramatic, right? Just… overpreparedness on steroids.

interviewer: It sounds like this constant sense of needing to be prepared is taking a toll on you. Have you experienced similar patterns of overwhelming worry and overpreparation in the past, where it affected your daily life or work?

patient: I’m a human doomsday prepper, I guess. Like, the freelance project I missed? I had 17 contingency plans for *possible* client feedback, not the actual deadline. My hands were so twitchy during the meeting I spilled coffee on the presentation—classic me, turning a typo into a disaster. But it’s not just work. Last month I resealed the shower twice because ‘what if the grout fails during a storm?’ It’s like my brain’s a broken machine that can’t stop recalibrating for problems that haven’t even shown up yet.

interviewer: It sounds like this pattern of over-preparing for hypothetical problems is both exhausting and frustrating for you. What have you found helpful in the past when you feel this level of overwhelm?

patient: Oh, you know, the usual. I try to... focus on things I can fix. Like, if I can just拆 apart the washing machine and rebuild it, maybe the rest of my life will follow some kind of logic. But it's a Sisyphean task, honestly. I drank a bit more last week, just to quiet the static—don't worry, it's not a thing. Clara says I should 'unplug,' but how do you unplug when your brain's a spreadsheet with no escape hatch? Classic me, turning a coffee spill into a existential crisis. Again.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to be constantly prepared might have roots in your upbringing. Can you share a bit about your family’s expectations or any history of anxiety in your family?

patient: My mom? She was all about 'busier is better.' If I wasn’t juggling projects, I was ‘wasting potential.’ My dad... he’s the guy who once told me graphic design was a ‘hobby for people who can’t add numbers.’ I guess I learned to build forts out of anxiety. But let’s not make this some tragic origin story—most people have lousy parents. I just... turned their noise into my internal spreadsheet. Still, Clara’s migraines are my fault, right? Classic me, making everything a project to fix.

interviewer: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: No, I don’t think so. I mean, sometimes I wonder if hitting ‘delete all’ would simplify things, but… I’ve got too many half-finished projects to cancel now. The washing machine’s a mess, but at least it’s *my* mess. Clara’d kill me if I gave up on her studio, anyway. Classic me—catastrophizing when I should just… fix the damn thing.

interviewer: Can you tell me about your alcohol use lately? How often have you been drinking, and what tends to trigger it?

patient: It’s been… more frequent, I guess. Mostly evenings with dinner. Stress triggers it—Clara’s migraines, the washing machine fiasco. But it’s not a thing. I just… need to unwind. Classic me, using wine as a band-aid for a spreadsheet of problems.

interviewer: I hear how alcohol feels like a temporary fix for a lot of stress. Have you used cannabis or other substances in the past few months, even occasionally?

patient: Cannabis? No, I’m not really... 'into it.' I mean, I’ve had a joint maybe once, years ago. Felt like trying to troubleshoot a software glitch with no manual—disorienting, unhelpful. I stick to wine. It’s less... variable. Classic me, overthinking even my 'down time.'

interviewer: I hear how you’ve used humor to describe your relationship with alcohol. Have you used any other substances, such as stimulants, opioids, or recreational drugs, in the past few months?

patient: Cannabis, maybe? If forgetting to water the plants counts as 'using it wisely,' then... yeah. But that's a story for the other therapist.

interviewer: It sounds like your relationship with cannabis is a bit ambiguous. Have you been using it regularly in the past few months, and if so, what tends to trigger that use?

patient: Regularly? If ‘occasionally forgetting to panic while I’m high’ counts, then… yes. Work deadlines, Clara’s migraines, that sort of thing. It’s not like I’m chain-smoking or anything—more of a… mood stabilizer. Though the washing machine breaking *again* definitely warranted a session. Classic me, treating household appliances like therapy bills.

interviewer: Have you used any other substances, such as stimulants or opioids, in the past few months?

patient: No, nothing like that. I’ve got enough variables to stress about without inviting more trouble. Though, in my defense, the wine with friends is basically a coping mechanism now. But let’s not get sidetracked—deadlines don’t fix themselves, and neither does a broken washing machine.

interviewer: I hear how you're managing stress through wine and humor. Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or over-the-counter remedies for anxiety, sleep, or other concerns?

patient: No medications, no. I’m not the type to… I mean, if I could fix it with a pill, I’d probably have a spreadsheet for that by now. Melatonin maybe? Once in a while, when the washing machine’s screaming at me and the static won’t let me sleep. But that’s just poor life choices, not a prescription. Let’s be real, though—Clara’s migraines are a bigger problem than my sleep hygiene. Again.

interviewer: Have you experienced periods where you felt unusually energetic, needed less sleep, or took on more projects than usual, even if they overlapped or seemed risky?

patient: Not really. When I’m stressed, I tend to… overwork, maybe? But that’s just my ‘perfectionist overdrive’ again. I barely sleep, but it’s more like my brain won’t shut off. The washing machine breaking helped me focus, oddly enough—like fixing it was the only thing that kept me from spiraling further. But that’s not ‘energy,’ that’s just static.

interviewer: It sounds like your stress is driving a lot of your current patterns. Have you experienced any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or having strong beliefs that feel unusual or hard to shake?

patient: No, nothing like that. I mean, my mind’s always running—like a broken record, if that counts. But it’s just... constant static. You know, the kind that makes your hands shake when you’re trying to sketch something for Clara’s gallery, or spill coffee in a meeting. I’d say it’s the same old stress, though. Maybe worse, but familiar. The washing machine’s been acting up again, so I’ve been focusing on that instead of... other things. Honestly, I’d rather fix the machine than talk about it. It’s a tangible problem, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like fixing the washing machine gives you a sense of control amidst the chaos. What supports or resources do you find most helpful when you're feeling overwhelmed like this?

patient: Lists, I guess? Organizing tasks helps... until I over-prepare instead of just doing them. Clara’s art studio still gives me purpose, but I end up blaming myself for her migraines anyway. There’s this... static that wine used to mute, but I’m not ‘a drinker,’ if that’s what you’re thinking. Fixing the washing machine? At least it’s something I can *do*. Something that doesn’t involve talking about why I can’t stop adding columns to my mental spreadsheet.

interviewer: It seems like you're managing a lot through tangible tasks. Have you been evaluated for any medical conditions that might contribute to your symptoms, such as thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain?

patient: No, I haven’t—haven’t had the bandwidth for blood tests when the washing machine’s on the fritz. I just... assume it’s stress. My mom always said ‘busier is better,’ so I figured if I just keep troubleshooting, my body’ll catch up. Though these shoulder blades? They feel like I’ve been wrestling dryers or something. Classic me—diagnose myself with ‘overzealous DIY’ instead of... whatever the real thing is.

Classic me—diagnose myself with ‘overzealous DIY’ instead of... whatever the real thing is.

interviewer: It sounds like self-diagnosis has been a way to manage uncertainty. Have you noticed any other physical symptoms or patterns that feel concerning but haven’t been checked out by a doctor?

patient: Honestly? My sleep’s a mess—three hours here, two there, like a broken clock. And my legs? They’re always jittery, like they’re trying to escape the couch. But it’s just stress, right? Classic me, turning my body into a parts bin for the washing machine of life.

interviewer: Joshua, based on our conversation, it sounds like your anxiety has roots in childhood pressures to equate busyness with worth, and it’s been fueled recently by work deadlines, Clara’s health, and household stressors like the broken washing machine. You’ve described a cycle where overpreparing for hypothetical problems leads to physical tension, sleep disruption, and strained relationships, while humor and alcohol offer temporary relief. What did I miss or misunderstand about your experience?

patient: You’re not wrong about the washing machine—it’s just... another thing to fix. But maybe you missed how my hands still shake when I try to fix it, or how I lie awake counting every sound it makes. The static never really stops, even when I’m ‘handling’ things. Classic me, right? Trying to troubleshoot a life that won’t stop glitching.
