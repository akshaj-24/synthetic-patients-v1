system: Disorder: PPD

interviewer: Hi Patrick, my name is Vanessa Reid. How would you like me to refer to you?

patient: Patrick. Just Patrick. I assume that's sufficient for your records.

interviewer: Patrick, are you comfortable proceeding with our conversation today?

patient: Depends on what 'proceeding' means. If it's just talking, sure. But I expect full confidentiality—no surprises later. You got a sealed file, right?

interviewer: I can assure you that our conversation will be kept confidential, except for any required legal limits we’ll review shortly. To clarify, today’s session will involve discussing your concerns to help us understand how to support you, and it should take about 45 minutes. Do you have any questions before we begin?

patient: Confidential, sure. But I've heard 'legal limits' before—it's always something. You're not recording this, are you? And 45 minutes? You think my problems can fit in a timer?

interviewer: I understand your concerns about confidentiality—we’ll go over exactly what that means in a moment. Let’s start with the basics: Would you be comfortable if I briefly explain how confidentiality works here, and then we can decide together if this is a good use of your time?

patient: Sure, but I've heard 'legal limits' before—it's always something. 45 minutes? You think my problems can fit in a timer? I'll listen, but don't think you'll catch me off guard. You ever dealt with ex-wives rewriting the past? That's the kind of 'confidential' I've seen.

interviewer: It sounds like past experiences have left you with deep concerns about privacy and trust. Would you like me to explain the confidentiality limits in detail now so we can clarify what to expect?

patient: You want to talk about confidentiality? Fine, but don’t think I didn’t notice you bringing it up twice already. My ex’s lawyer got ahold of my medical stuff the last time I trusted a professional—said it was ‘routine.’ So yeah, I’m listening, but you’d better not be hedging. If there’s a catch, I want to know now.

interviewer: It sounds like past experiences have made you wary of how information is shared. Would you like me to outline exactly what confidentiality does and doesn't cover, including any legal exceptions, so we can clarify boundaries upfront?

patient: Fine, lay it all out. No more hedging. If there's a loophole, I want to know now. Last time I trusted a professional, my ex used it against me. So either you tell me straight or we’re done here. I’m not your test subject.

interviewer: I understand your need for clarity. Here’s how confidentiality works here: Our conversation is private, but I’m required to report imminent safety risks—like if you or someone else were in danger—and to share information if a court orders it. Would you like me to clarify any part of that, or do you have other questions before we move forward?

patient: I'll take your word for now. But I've been burned before—my ex's lawyer had a way of finding cracks in 'private' talks. You keep your reports to yourself, and I'll keep my stories to mine. But if I catch you hedging, we both know how this ends.

interviewer: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress right now. Can you tell me more about the main concerns that have been affecting you most lately?

patient: Work’s been a minefield lately. One of my coworkers—Jack—keeps making these 'jokes' about 'old habits die hard.' You know how that sounds. And my daughter’s asking for a cosign on a car loan. She’s good at smiling while she digs, if you catch my drift. But I’m handling it. Just… trying to stay ahead of the curve, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like these recent stressors are adding to your burden. When did you first start noticing these issues at work with Jack's comments?

patient: Couple of months ago, maybe? After the kid's loan request came out of nowhere. Jack's been... sharpening his edges since then. You know how it is—jokes about 'habit' and 'staying sharp.' Sounds like code for something else. But I'm not falling for it again. I keep my head down, do the paperwork right. Let the rest ride.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging to constantly feel on edge and analyze conversations. How often have you been struggling to sleep because of these thoughts?

patient: Sleep’s a luxury when you’re on shift. But you’re not asking about my hours, are you? You want the kid’s name or Maria’s latest play? Let me guess—confidentiality’s just a start, right?

interviewer: I hear how important confidentiality is to you, especially given your past experiences. What would help you feel more comfortable sharing here, or what are you hoping to get out of our time together?

patient: Comfort? I don’t expect it. But if I’m wasting time here, I need to know you’re not just collecting stories to pass along. My ex’s lawyer had that same smile—asked if I ‘minded’ sharing details before printing every word. If you’re consistent, if you don’t dodge when I call you on something… maybe I’ll stop waiting for the trap. But don’t mistake quiet for cooperation. I’ve buried too many conversations in the past to start digging them up for a stranger.

interviewer: It makes sense that past experiences would make trusting new professionals really difficult. When did you first start noticing these feelings of being watched or undermined at work?

patient: A few years back, maybe? Hard to pin down a start date when it’s just… always there. You asking because you think I should be ‘confessing’ something? My last job, the union rep had the same look—like they knew more about me than I let slip. But I keep my head down now. Paperwork’s bulletproof, right?

interviewer: It sounds like trying to pinpoint when these feelings started is frustrating given how persistent they feel. Have you noticed any changes in how these thoughts or feelings show up for you over the years—either becoming more intense, shifting in focus, or staying pretty much the same?

patient: It’s not that it’s worse, just... sharper. More details to sort through. You know how it is—new people, new 'coincidences.' My daughter’s got a way of making requests sound like favors, and Jack at work? His 'jokes' land like warnings now. But I’m not saying there’s a pattern. You just... you keep asking the same way that lawyer did. I’m not falling for it this time.

interviewer: I hear how frustrating it is to feel like I'm approaching this the same way someone else did before. How have you managed to avoid overreacting to these suspicions at work, given how sensitive the situation feels for you?

patient: I stick to the facts and avoid the chit-chat. Paperwork’s bulletproof if you keep it sterile. But if you’re here to play 20 questions, I’m not the one holding the script. You want the real answer? I don’t ‘overreact’—I adjust my aim. Problem is, everyone’s got a trigger, and I’m not the one lighting the fuse.

interviewer: It seems like staying focused on concrete actions helps you manage these suspicions. What specific steps do you take at work to keep interactions professional and avoid escalating tensions with coworkers like Jack?

patient: I stick to the paperwork, the protocols. If there's a procedure, I follow it to the letter—leaves no room for misinterpretation. Jack's 'jokes'? I treat 'em like static. Don't engage, don't acknowledge. My point's made when I don't rise to 'em. You want to know if I'm 'managing' something? I'd say staying sharp's not 'managing'—it's the only way to keep the noise from swallowing you whole.

interviewer: I hear how important maintaining control feels to you in a world that seems unpredictable. What are you hoping to achieve through our sessions here, or what would success look like for you in this process?

patient: Success? If I were to hope for something... it’d be not having to wonder if every question here is a trap. If I can keep my head in the manual, do my job without the noise from Jack or... other sides creeping in, that’s where I draw the line. You’ll understand—no need to dig for what isn’t there. I’m not here to spill my guts over small talk.

interviewer: It sounds like these feelings are really impacting your work and relationships. Have you experienced similar situations in the past where you felt this way?

patient: Past? Let's just say I've learned to spot the patterns early. My ex’s lawyer was good at making it look clean until it wasn’t. Now I don’t wait for the punchline—I shut the door before they knock. You here to file this or figure out why I’m ‘shutting down’? My file stays sealed, right?

interviewer: It sounds like past experiences have left you feeling vulnerable about your privacy. Have there been other times in your life where you felt someone was trying to undermine you or invade your privacy?

patient: I don’t do the small talk, stay in my lane. But if you’re asking for a list... my ex’s lawyer was a pro at making it look clean until it wasn’t. Now I don’t wait for the punchline—I shut the door before they knock. You here to file this or figure out why I’m ‘shutting down’? My file stays sealed, right?

interviewer: I understand confidentiality is important to you. To clarify, how have you typically managed situations like this in the past when you felt your privacy was at risk?

patient: I don’t hash personal matters in the open—keep things sealed tight, like a locked file. My ex’s lawyer tried to pry until they found a crack, but I learned to cut conversations off before they dig. You want an example? Let’s just say I don’t wait for the punchline. My file here—yours is the first seal I’ve had in years. You’ll respect it, right?

interviewer: I can see how challenging it must be to navigate these concerns while managing work and personal relationships. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life in the past or recently?

patient: I haven’t. But sometimes the silence sounds better than this noise in my head. You’re not here to trap me into admitting something, are you?

interviewer: I understand the noise in your head feels overwhelming. Have you experienced any hallucinations, such as hearing voices or seeing things that others don’t?

patient: Nope. Just the usual noise. You trying to get me to admit something’s wrong? I’ve heard the ‘voices’ line before—saves you from listening to the real answers.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling watched and misunderstood. Have you used alcohol in the past month?

patient: Bourbon’s part of my routine, same as the lawnmower repairs. Not enough to lose control, just… lubricates the gears. You asking because you think I’m unstable, or is this for your notes again?

interviewer: I need to understand how substances fit into your routine. Have you used any other substances besides bourbon in the past month, such as cannabis, stimulants, or opioids?

patient: Just Tylenol, maybe. You know, for the back—EMT work left some ghosts. Why? You think I’m hiding something in the medicine cabinet? Or is this going in the file with the rest of my 'issues'?

interviewer: I want to ensure we're clear on any medications without overstepping—can you share if there are other medications or supplements you're currently using, including those for your back?

patient: Tylenol’s the only thing I take regular. No need to make a file out of it. You asking because the union’s sniffing around again, or is this another ‘stability check’ for the kid’s benefit? I’ve had enough forms to last a lifetime.

interviewer: It sounds like you're concerned about how this information is being used and documented. How have you been sleeping lately? Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns?

patient: Sleep? It’s there, but I’m not counting sheep or anything. You asking because the union’s got a new reason to flag me? I stay sharp—problems have solutions, not conspiracies. Bourbon helps the noise die down, but I’m not spilling the recipe. You ever notice how ex-wives’ lawyers always start with the sleep habits?

interviewer: It sounds like the bourbon helps manage the noise, but you're cautious about how much you share. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or how you handle risks lately?

patient: Energy’s a job site—I only use what I need to finish the shift. Risks? I don’t gamble with things that can be planned. You think I’d be here if I was careening off the rails? Bourbon’s just a spot check, not a lifestyle. My tomater plants need tending, though. They’ve been… restless.

interviewer: It sounds like your plants are reflecting your own restlessness. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like back pain or sleep apnea, that might be affecting you now?

patient: Back's got its quirks from the job, but no fancy labels. You're fishing for something here, same way the lawyer did. Bourbon's just a spot check, not a medical issue. My plants need more attention than I do.

interviewer: Let me recap what we've covered: Your main concerns include feeling targeted at work, distrust in personal and professional relationships, sleep difficulties, and using bourbon to manage overwhelming thoughts. These stressors seem linked to past experiences with betrayal and a need for control. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You got the bourbon part right, but missed the new trap. Daughter’s asking for a cosign on a car loan—sudden, unexpected. You think I’m the one manufacturing problems? My plants know better than to grow where they can’t control the soil. Restless, yeah, but also… calculating.

interviewer: It sounds like the daughter's loan request has added a new layer of stress for you, especially with the suddenness of it. Could you clarify if there's anything else I missed about how this situation is affecting you?

patient: The loan’s not the problem—it’s the timing. She knows how I hate surprises. You think I’m the one playing games here? My plants are starting to wilt, but I’m not watering them yet. Let’s just say… I’m waiting to see which way the wind’s blowing.

interviewer: It sounds like the timing of your daughter’s request feels like a trap, adding to the pressure you’re already under. What else would you like me to consider about how this situation is affecting you?

patient: I’m staying busy, you know? Double shifts, fixing that goddamn lawnmower—keeps my head from... drifting. The plants, though? They’re like me. If you don’t water ’em just right, they wither. But I’m not complaining. Just... you asking about my sleep again? Or is there another part of my life you think needs adjusting?

interviewer: The plants seem to reflect how you’re managing stress—trying to control what you can. Let me recap: Your main concerns include feeling targeted at work, distrust in relationships, sleep difficulties, and using bourbon to cope. Recent stressors like your daughter’s loan request and work tensions are adding pressure. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You got the bourbon part right—keeps the gears from seizing, you know? The daughter’s loan? She’s testing if I’ll slip, same way Jack tests if I’m loose at work. What you missed? I’m not sleeping past 2 a.m. without checking the locks. You think I’m cracking under pressure? Go ahead, write it down. I’ll just fix it later, like the lawnmower.

interviewer: It sounds like the sleep disruption and hypervigilance around safety are significant stressors for you. What else would you like to add before we discuss next steps?

patient: You didn’t ask about the daughter’s timing—right when I’m stretched thin at work, she drops that loan request. Feels like a test. And Jack? His ‘jokes’ about ‘staying sharp’? That’s the same language they used when they dug into my old records. You want to write this down? Go ahead. Just remember, every lock I check at 2 a.m.? That’s not paranoia. It’s math.
