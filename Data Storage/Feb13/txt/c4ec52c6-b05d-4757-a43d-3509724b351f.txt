system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Janet. I want to make sure I understand your goals for today—can you confirm if you're comfortable proceeding with this session as we discuss your current concerns?

patient: I... I guess so. I mean, I’m here, so... yeah. It’s just—been a lot lately. But I’ll try. I’ll try to talk about what needs to be talked about.

interviewer: It takes courage to take this step, Janet. Would you be comfortable proceeding with our discussion today?

patient: I... appreciate you saying that. It’s just... hard to explain. I mean, I’m here, so... yeah. Mochi’s been keeping me busy lately, which is... something, I guess. But the laundry’s piling up, and I can’t even bring myself to start it. Feels like my legs are made of concrete sometimes. I don’t know. Let’s... let’s talk.

interviewer: It sounds like starting this session feels a bit overwhelming right now. Do you have any questions about how today's session will work before we begin?

patient: I guess not. I’ve just been so... stuck, you know? Like the other day, I tried to fold laundry but couldn’t even start. Mochi knocked over a water glass earlier, and I just... let it sit. It’s silly, really. Maybe we could just talk? I don’t know what else to do.

interviewer: Can you tell me more about what's been going on for you lately?

patient: It’s... hard to know where to start. The divorce finalized a few months ago, and it felt like everything just... slowed down. I’m still working, but my mind feels foggy, like I’m underwater trying to think. I used to watch Mochi play with yarn, but now even that feels too much. I let the water glass sit for days because I couldn’t bend over to clean it. It’s not that I don’t want to... it’s like my body’s decided I’m not worth the effort. But Mochi still purrs, so... I guess that’s something.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging. When did you first start noticing these feelings of being overwhelmed and struggling with daily tasks?

patient: It’s hard to pinpoint the exact moment… I guess things just started piling up after the divorce finalized six months ago. Before that, I was used to moving like I had to catch up to everyone else—like my legs were made of concrete. Now, even brushing my teeth feels like climbing a hill. I’ll leave a glass of water on the counter for days… not because I’m lazy, just… numb? Mochi keeps me from disappearing completely, I think. But the rest? It’s like my body’s decided to forget how to function.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly draining. How have these feelings changed for you since the divorce finalized six months ago—have they stayed the same, gotten worse, or shifted in any way?

patient: They... they just got heavier, I guess. Like the concrete in my legs turned to bricks. I used to at least *try* to keep up at work, but now I’ll spend 20 minutes just folding laundry because my hands won’t cooperate. My supervisor said something about ‘slowing down’ the other day, and I immediately apologized—even though I know it’s not *me*. I wake up at 3 a.m. now and just stare at the ceiling… but when Mochi jumps on the bed and purrs, I fake smile and tell myself I’ll fix the washing machine tomorrow. Or maybe next week. I’m used to putting things off, I guess.

interviewer: That sounds really tough, Janet. It must be frustrating to feel like your body is working against you even when you want to take care of things. What is it that you're hoping to address or improve by coming in today?

patient: I guess... I just want to feel like I can keep up with the basics without everything feeling like a chore. Maybe stop letting Mochi’s toys collect dust. I don’t know. It’s hard to hope for anything bigger when my head feels like it’s full of static.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry every day. When did you first notice chores like cleaning up after Mochi or doing laundry becoming too overwhelming to manage?

patient: I guess... it was around the time the divorce papers came through. I used to at least pick up Mochi’s toys when they scattered, but now I let them sit. It’s not that I don’t have time—it’s like my hands forget how to *move*. Laundry? I’ll start a load, then spend 10 minutes just... staring at the socks. My supervisor says I’m ‘doing fine,’ but I keep apologizing anyway. I think I tell myself, *Tomorrow, I’ll finish it*, but tomorrow just feels too far away sometimes.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging. You mentioned waking up at 3 a.m. and staring at the ceiling—have these sleep disturbances been happening most nights, or do they come and go?

patient: It’s... it’s pretty much every night now. I’ll wake up at 3 a.m. like clockwork, but lying there, I can’t even count sheep without my eyes closing. The problem is... I don’t *want* to fall back asleep. It feels like I’m just delaying the day, you know? Mochi jumps on the bed sometimes, and I guess it helps... proves I’m not completely alone. But the mornings? I’m just... tired of being tired.

interviewer: It sounds like these feelings are really impacting your daily life. Have there been times in the past when you felt similar to how you're feeling now?

patient: I guess not really. I’ve had my share of stress, but this feels... heavier. Like I can’t even keep up with the little things. I used to be able to push through, but now... I don’t know. Maybe I’m just getting old?

interviewer: It sounds like this feels different from past stressors you’ve managed. Have there been any other times in your life when you experienced a sense of being overwhelmed or struggled to keep up with daily tasks, even if the emotions felt different?

patient: I guess... maybe in my 30s? When my dad was still alive. He was real hard on me, always pointing out what I did wrong. But I just kept working, you know? Pushed through. This time... it’s different. The fog in my head, the legs like concrete—it’s like my body’s refusing to cooperate. I keep thinking I should just snap out of it, but... (pauses, rubs arms) Mochi’s the only thing that feels real. Otherwise, I don’t know why I bother getting up some days.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to carry that weight for so long. Was that time with your father similar to how you're feeling now, or did you manage to push through in ways that feel different from your current experience?

patient: I guess... back then, it was more about proving I wasn’t a disappointment. Now it’s like my body’s decided to quit on me. (Pauses, fingers fidget with sleeve seam) Even faking normal takes so much effort—like dragging bricks uphill. My dad’s criticism was loud, but this? This is the quiet rot. The only thing that feels real is Mochi’s purring… even if I still can’t bring myself to play with her yarn.

interviewer: It sounds like your father's criticism was a significant challenge for you. Have you gone through other periods where you felt overwhelmed like this, and if so, what helped you during those times?

patient: I guess... the only thing that helped back then was just keeping busy. Like, if I stayed at work late or took on extra shifts, the noise in my head would quiet down a little. But this time? (shrugs, fingers still fidgeting with her sleeve) There’s no ‘extra’ left to push through. My brain feels like a fog machine and my legs... (pauses, forced chuckle) They’re not even made of concrete anymore. They’re bricks. Or maybe just... dead weight.

interviewer: It sounds like your usual strategy of staying busy isn't working the same way now. Have you had other times in your life where you felt stuck in this way, where even your usual ways of coping didn't help?

patient: I guess... no. Back then, even when it was hard, I could still force myself to keep going. Now? It's like my body's broken, you know? Even the usual things don't work. (pauses, fiddles with sleeve) Maybe... maybe it's just getting worse with age. Mochi's the only thing that... that feels like an anchor sometimes.

interviewer: I want to check in about your safety. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself recently?

patient: I guess... some nights I just want the noise to stop. Like, I’ll lie there until 3 a.m. thinking, ‘Why even bother waking up?’ But then I remember Mochi’s waiting for his breakfast, and... well, he’s a brat about his tuna. Doesn’t make sense, does it? I’m just so used to being a burden, but I guess cats don’t care about that.

interviewer: It sounds like those thoughts can feel really heavy, especially at night. How often have you been having these thoughts where waking up feels like too much?

patient: Most nights, I guess... the clock ticks past 3 again. It’s not like I *plan* anything, but the thought of facing another day... feels like hauling bricks. Mochi’s the only reason I bother showering sometimes. Even if I’m just... pretending to be okay for him. Doesn’t make sense, does it?

interviewer: It sounds like Mochi gives you a sense of purpose even when things feel overwhelming. Have you had any specific plans or thoughts about how you might act on those feelings of not wanting to wake up?

patient: I... I don’t think I’ve ever really thought about *how*. It’s more like the idea lingers when I can’t sleep. Sometimes I wonder if just... not getting out of bed would be easier. But then I remember the cat’s dinner, or the vet bill I haven’t paid yet. Doesn’t make sense, but it’s like those little things keep me stuck in the same loop. I guess I keep thinking if I can’t even fix the small stuff, why would anyone care if I vanished?

interviewer: It sounds like those responsibilities give you a sense of purpose even when it’s hard. Have you thought about any specific way you might act on those thoughts of not wanting to wake up?

patient: I don’t know... I guess it’s more like the *idea* of just... stopping. Like, if I could will myself to sleep forever? But even that feels selfish. Mochi’s always mewing at 5 a.m. for breakfast, and I can’t let him starve, you know? Doesn’t make sense, but... I’m used to being a burden. The cat’s probably better off with someone who actually *wants* to feed him.

interviewer: It sounds like your relationship with Mochi adds meaningful structure to your days. Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed less sleep, even briefly?

patient: No... I don’t think so. I’ve been so exhausted most nights, even when I do manage to sleep past 3 a.m., it’s like my body’s still running on empty. The only thing that keeps me moving is the thought of Mochi’s dinner waiting on the counter. But that’s not energy, really—it’s more like... guilt, I guess.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing how Mochi helps you keep going. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or having strong beliefs that feel unusual?

patient: No, I don’t think so. I mean... my head feels foggy a lot, like I can’t quite focus. But that’s probably just me being tired all the time. I guess I’m used to my mind feeling like this by now.

interviewer: Have you noticed any changes in your use of alcohol, cannabis, or other substances recently?

patient: Not really... I mean, I used to have a glass of wine maybe once in a while, but even that feels like too much effort these days. I guess I’m just too tired to think about it. And with Mochi’s vet bills piling up, I can’t exactly afford to spend on things like that anyway.

interviewer: It sounds like your focus on Mochi's needs has taken priority over self-care lately. Have you used cannabis, stimulants, opioids, or other substances recently?

patient: No... I haven’t. I mean, I’m barely keeping up with Mochi’s food let alone spending on anything else. And honestly? I don’t think it would even matter. My body feels like it’s already shut down half the day anyway.

interviewer: It sounds like your focus on Mochi's care has been a stabilizing force. Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed much less sleep, even briefly?

patient: No, not really. I mean, some days I feel like I have to push through for Mochi, but that’s just... responsibility. I guess the early mornings don’t count if I’m just sitting there staring at the walls anyway.

interviewer: Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal remedies?

patient: No medications... I guess I haven’t even thought about it. My head’s just always like this, so I don’t know what else to do. And with Mochi’s food and vet visits, I can’t really afford to spend on pills or anything like that.

interviewer: Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain, that might be contributing to your energy levels or mood?

patient: I guess I haven’t been officially diagnosed with anything... maybe my doctor mentioned a thyroid check once, but it was normal. To be honest, I’ve been so focused on work and Mochi’s vet bills lately. It’s probably just... stress? Or getting old?

interviewer: From our conversation, I understand that since your divorce six months ago, you've been struggling with overwhelming fatigue, slowed movement, and difficulty managing daily tasks. These symptoms seem to be made worse by sleep disturbances and financial stress about your cat Mochi’s care, though your responsibility to him keeps you going. We’ve also noticed patterns tied to lifelong perfectionism and a history of pushing through stress by overworking. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?

patient: I guess you got most of it... maybe the part about feeling like I’m a burden to my daughter? She doesn’t call much, and I assume it’s because I’m dragging her down. And sometimes... I just wish I could sleep through the noise, you know? But I figure that’s just tiredness from worrying about Mochi’s bills.

interviewer: It sounds like feeling like a burden to your daughter and the stress about Mochi’s bills are adding to your sense of heaviness and hopelessness. What did I miss or get wrong about how these feelings fit into your experience?

patient: I guess... you didn’t mention how I keep messing up at work lately. I apologize for everything—like the other day, I spilled a water glass and kept saying ‘sorry’ even after I cleaned it up. It’s dumb, right? My supervisor hasn’t said anything, but I know she’s tired of it. But... Mochi’s vet appointment is next week, so I have to focus. If I get fired, at least he’ll have the money for the exam.

interviewer: It sounds like your work performance and guilt about Mochi’s care are central to your current distress. What did I miss or get wrong about how these fit into your experience?

patient: I guess... you didn’t mention how I’m scared I’m going to mess up Mochi’s care if I keep slipping up at work. Like, what if I forget his meds or can’t afford the exam? It’s just another proof I’m failing at everything. But I can’t let him down... he’s all I’ve got left, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like your fear of failing Mochi is deeply tied to both your work struggles and your broader sense of self-worth. Let me try to summarize: Since your divorce, you’ve experienced severe fatigue, slowed movements, and difficulty managing daily tasks, which have worsened over time. Your work performance has declined, and you’re worried about financial and caregiving responsibilities for Mochi, whom you see as your last emotional anchor. These stressors amplify feelings of hopelessness and self-criticism, even as Mochi’s care gives you a reason to keep going. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?

patient: I guess you didn’t mention how... sometimes I just want to stop worrying altogether. Like, let the noise fade. But then Mochi meows, and I have to get up. It’s dumb, right? Probably just tired.
