system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Mr. Jones, may I start by confirming your name and how you'd like to be addressed?

patient: Yes, Steven Jones. Please call me Steven. I—I think I mentioned in the paperwork, but yes, that’s correct. It’s… just Steven. No middle name, so it’s straightforward, I guess.

interviewer: Thank you, Steven. I want to take a moment to explain what we'll be doing today to make sure you're comfortable. This session will involve discussing your current concerns and how we can work together to address them. Does that sound okay with you?

patient: Yes, that sounds fine. I mean, I’ve done paperwork already, so… just need to fill in the blanks, right? Though I should probably check my email later—work’s been sending updates about the summer program. My daughter’s soccer practice starts at 4, so I can’t stay too late, but I’m sure we’ll work something out.

interviewer: Steven, given your busy schedule, are you comfortable proceeding with this session today?

patient: Yes, I guess so. I should probably wrap up by 4, though—my daughter’s practice starts then. Work’s been sending a lot of emails about the summer program... I need to at least skim them tonight. If that makes sense.

interviewer: Steven, can you tell me more about what’s been on your mind lately that brought you here today?

patient: Well, work's been... busy lately. The summer program planning is taking up a lot of time. I’ve just been feeling a bit... off, I guess. Like my brain’s not quite catching up. And sleep—haven’t been getting enough, which doesn’t help. But it’s manageable, I think.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to manage everything while feeling so off. When did you first start noticing these feelings of being 'off' or like your brain wasn't catching up?

patient: I guess it started... maybe around the time the grant fell through. Seven months ago? It’s hard to pin down exactly. I just began feeling like I was running on a lower gear, you know? Sleep’s been... inconsistent. I wake up at 3 a.m. and can’t shake the fog the next day. Work’s piling up, but I tell myself it’s just fatigue. If you ask me, it’s probably all the caffeine wearing off.

interviewer: It sounds like those sleep disruptions have been really persistent—have these feelings of being on a lower gear and waking up at 3 a.m. stayed about the same, gotten worse, or improved at all over the past seven months?

patient: It’s stayed... consistent, I guess. The 3 a.m. thing? That’s become sort of a fixture. I thought maybe my body would adjust, but the fog the next day? Still there. The fatigue’s worse when deadlines pile up, but I tell myself it’s just... work pressure. Caffeine helps, but it’s like trying to shine a light through fog—just buys time.

interviewer: That sounds like a really challenging cycle to be in—pushing through the fog while it deepens. What are your hopes or goals for coming to therapy, Steven?

patient: Honestly? I’m not sure. I guess... I want to figure out how to stop feeling like I’m running on empty all the time. If therapy can help me reset that 3 a.m. clock or actually tackle the workload without the caffeine fog, that’d be... helpful. My daughter’s soccer practices mean a lot to her, so being there without the brain fog? That’s a start. But I don’t know if that’s even realistic.

interviewer: It sounds like the 3 a.m. wakefulness and brain fog are really interfering with what matters most to you—work and family. Have you tried any strategies so far to help manage the fatigue or the mental fog during the day?

patient: I rely on caffeine—maybe 5 cups a day? It buys time, but the fog’s still there. I try laying out clothes the night before, organizing my day in advance to save mental energy. It helps a little, I guess… but the brain still feels like it’s stuck in slow motion. Doesn’t really help the fog, though.

interviewer: It sounds like you're doing a lot to manage with what you have available. Have you tried any other strategies besides caffeine and organization to help with the mental fog or fatigue, even if they didn't work as well?

patient: I’ve tried going for walks in the evening to wind down, but it’s hard to shake the... the restlessness. Sometimes I’ll rewatch an old episode of Poirot—used to find the predictability comforting. Now I just end up staring at the screen, unable to follow the plot. And the cat... she’s been more demanding lately. I guess I take it out on her when the fog feels too thick to move.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy mix of frustration and isolation—thank you for sharing that. What changes in the past few months have made things feel unmanageable enough to consider seeking help now?

patient: It’s been a slow build, honestly. The grant rejection was a hit, but what really piled on was realizing I couldn’t just power through the fatigue anymore. I started waking at 3 a.m., and even with coffee, I’m running on fumes by noon. It’s made me short-tempered—my wife’s been giving me that *look* for weeks. I guess… I needed to check in before it all seeps into things I can’t fix, like my daughter’s soccer practices or… well, the Sudoku puzzles taking forever now.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging. Have you experienced similar periods of feeling overwhelmed or exhausted in the past, especially related to work or other stressors?

patient: There was the grant season last year, but that was more all-consuming in a different way. I could still power through with coffee then. Now... it’s like the tired’s stuck in my bones, you know? Even when I’m not working, my head feels like it’s in a fog. The grant thing was a project—this feels like a leak I can’t patch.

interviewer: It sounds like this fatigue is more persistent and different from past stress. Have you had periods in the past where you felt a similar kind of exhaustion or hopelessness, and if so, what helped you get through those times?

patient: I guess the closest was grant season last year—it consumed me, but I could still push through with coffee. This time... the tired feels stuck in my bones. Even when I’m not working, my head’s in a fog. If you ask me, the difference is I used to think grinding through it would help. Now, even small things... like Sudoku... take twice as long, and I can’t shake the sense that I’m just... static. But maybe that’s just age, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like this shift from temporary stress to something more persistent is really wearing on you. Can you tell me more about your relationship with your wife—how has she supported you during this time, and what has been most challenging in your interactions with her?

patient: She’s… patient, I guess. We don’t fight, but there’s this… look she gets when I snap at her over trivial stuff. Like the other night, she asked how I was really doing, and I just muttered about deadlines. Later, she said she felt ignored. I’m not sure I’ve made it easy for her to reach me. The truth is, I worry I’m a burden—like my silence is its own kind of demand. But I tell myself it’s just… fatigue, you know?

interviewer: Have you had any thoughts about ending your life in the past few weeks?

patient: I haven’t... I mean, it’s not that kind of tired. It’s more like my brain’s on a rusted gear—keeps spinning but nowhere to go. I guess... I guess I’ve wondered what it’d be like to just... stop waking up. But that’s probably just the sleep debt talking, right?

interviewer: That sounds like a really heavy burden to carry. Have these thoughts of not wanting to wake up included specific wishes to end your life, or are they more about wishing the exhaustion would just stop?

patient: I... I guess it’s mostly about the exhaustion. The 3 a.m. wakefulness—it’s like my brain can’t reset, you know? I just want to wake up without feeling like I’m dragging concrete blocks. But I don’t... I don’t think about specifics. It’s more like the weight of it all. Though, to be honest, the Sudoku puzzles still give me a tiny bit of focus. It’s the only thing that feels... measurable lately.

interviewer: That sounds like a really heavy burden to carry. When you told your wife you wanted to 'sleep forever,' did that feel more like a passive hope to escape the exhaustion, or was there any part of it where you actually wanted to end your life?

patient: I... I think it’s mostly the exhaustion. When I said that, I was just... overwhelmed by how tired I am. The Sudoku still gives me something to focus on, even if it’s hard. It’s not like I want to disappear, just to... wake up without feeling like I’m carrying bricks. But I guess it’s hard to explain. My wife says I’m overthinking, but I’m not sure she understands how heavy it all feels.

interviewer: It sounds like the exhaustion is taking a heavy toll on you. Have you ever had any attempts to harm yourself or engaged in self-injury that wasn't meant to end your life?

patient: No, I haven’t... I guess I haven’t gone that far. It’s more like I’m just... running on fumes. The caffeine helps, but it’s this constant battle to stay functional. I know it’s not healthy, but it’s easier to blame the coffee than... than admit how tired I really am. The Sudoku puzzles, the routine—they’re my way of holding on. It’s just... noise, you know? Keeping my head above water.

interviewer: It sounds like caffeine is a big part of your daily routine. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use recently?

patient: Not really, to be honest. I’ve stuck with coffee—five, maybe six cups most days. It’s easier to blame the caffeine than... than admit how tired I am. I guess I haven’t felt the need for anything else. My wife says I’m overdoing it, but it’s just... part of my routine now.

interviewer: It sounds like caffeine is a big part of your daily routine. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or need very little sleep, even when you're stressed?

patient: No, I don’t think so. If anything, when I’m stressed, my sleep just... unravels more. The 3 a.m. wakefulness becomes worse, and I’m just chasing caffeine to hold things together. It’s not energy—it’s like trying to patch a leaky boat with duct tape. You know it’s failing, but you keep going through the motions anyway.

interviewer: It sounds like the sleep disruption is really amplifying your stress and fatigue. Have you noticed any experiences where you hear voices, see things others don't, or have strong beliefs that others might find unusual or paranoid?

patient: No, I don’t think so. It’s more like... my mind races when I can’t sleep. I guess it doesn’t help that I’m running on fumes most days. The caffeine’s not helping either, if you ask me.

interviewer: It sounds like caffeine is a central part of your routine but isn't providing the relief you need. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, either prescribed or over-the-counter, to help with your energy, sleep, or other symptoms?

patient: No prescriptions, just... the usual stuff. Caffeine's my mainstay, though it's more like a crutch at this point. I pick up some antacids sometimes—the stomach doesn't take the coffee well. It's all pretty standard, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like your body’s been working overtime to keep up with the demands. Have you ever been checked for things like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain that might be contributing to this kind of fatigue?

patient: No, I haven’t had any tests for that. I guess I just... chalk it up to the usual suspects—stress, caffeine, maybe just getting older. The antacids are more of a bandage for the coffee, honestly. If you ask me, it’s all part of the same... well, the same tired machine running too long.

interviewer: Steven, based on our conversation, it sounds like you've been struggling with persistent fatigue and sleep issues for months, which have affected your work, family time, and relationships. We've also talked about how stress from the grant rejection and caffeine reliance might be contributing, while your wife's support is a key strength. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?

patient: You didn’t mention the sink under the kitchen that’s been leaking for weeks. I just let it go, you know? And the cat’s been persistent lately, like it’s demanding something I can’t give. But those are probably just... minor things compared to the rest.

interviewer: It sounds like the sink and the cat are part of the small tasks and responsibilities that feel harder to manage right now. What else would you like me to include or adjust in how I’m summarizing your experience?

patient: The performance review I’ve been avoiding—it’s like another leak I’m not fixing. And the Sudoku… it’s not just a game. It’s the last thing that feels like an accomplishment, even if it takes forever. But those might be the only things left that matter.

interviewer: It sounds like the performance review and Sudoku represent important areas of struggle and accomplishment for you. Is there anything else I should include or adjust in this summary?

patient: I think you’ve got the Sudoku part right—it’s the only thing that still feels doable, even if it’s a slog. The sink under the kitchen counter… I guess it’s another thing I can’t seem to fix, like everything else. But maybe that’s just me being overly critical. I don’t know if it adds much.

interviewer: It sounds like the Sudoku represents a rare source of accomplishment while the sink symbolizes feelings of being overwhelmed by unmanageable tasks. Let me briefly summarize: We’ve discussed your persistent fatigue, sleep issues, irritability, and how these are affecting your work, family, and self-perception. The Sudoku and performance review seem to highlight your struggle with maintaining productivity and self-worth. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?

patient: I think that’s about right, though the cat’s meowing at 3 a.m. feels more like a taunt than just overwhelm—like it’s mocking the ‘orderly solutions’ I used to find in Poirot. The antacids I’ve been popping? Maybe that’s just middle-aged indigestion, but… they’re another habit I can’t quite track down the source of. And the performance review—I guess you could say avoiding it is its own kind of Sudoku, trying to figure out how to fill in the blanks without making a mess. But maybe that’s just me overcomplicating things again.

interviewer: It sounds like the cat’s nighttime behavior and the antacids reflect how small stressors feel amplified when you’re already stretched thin. Let me briefly recap: We’ve discussed your persistent fatigue, sleep disruption, work avoidance, and how these are linked to feelings of being overwhelmed and self-critical. What concerns or preferences do you have about next steps—for example, therapy, lifestyle adjustments, or other support?

patient: I guess if there’s a starting point, it’d be… figuring out the sink under the kitchen counter. It’s been dripping for months, and I keep putting it off. Maybe if I tackle that, it’d help with… the rest? The Sudoku keeps me from feeling totally untethered, so I don’t know if I need anything else—just… more time to untangle the small stuff before it all backs up. But if therapy’s necessary, I suppose scheduling it around the performance review wouldn’t be impossible. It’s just another task to… file properly, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like the sink represents a manageable starting point for regaining control, while the Sudoku offers a sense of structure you’re holding onto. Let me summarize: We’ve explored how persistent fatigue, sleep disruption, and self-critical thoughts are affecting your work, relationships, and daily tasks. The sink and Sudoku feel like metaphors for your struggles with productivity and self-worth. What else would you like me to include or adjust before we discuss next steps like scheduling therapy or exploring other strategies?

patient: I think that’s a fair summary, though the cat’s midnight meowing… it’s more than just noise. Feels like it’s keeping score, somehow. And the antacids—I guess they’re just another habit I can’t quite place, like they’re masking something I’m not ready to name. But maybe that’s overthinking. The Sudoku still anchors me, even if each puzzle feels like climbing a mountain. The performance review… I’ll cross that bridge when I have to. For now, fixing the sink might be the only thing that feels within reach.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing so openly today, Steven. Before we wrap up, let’s make sure we have a clear plan for next steps. We’ll schedule your follow-up in two weeks to check in on how the strategies we discussed are working for your sleep and energy levels. In the meantime, if you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or those thoughts about not wanting to wake up return, who could you reach out to for support? Your wife mentioned she’s been patient—would you feel comfortable leaning on her if needed?

patient: I suppose my wife would be the first, though I don’t want to add to her worries. The Sudoku still keeps me grounded, and fixing the sink might help me feel less... stuck. But I’d rather not dwell on the other thoughts. If they get too loud, I guess I’ll call her.

interviewer: It’s clear you’re making thoughtful efforts to stay connected and manage what feels overwhelming. Let’s confirm your follow-up: we’ll check in two weeks to see how the strategies we discussed—like Sudoku, reaching out to your wife, and tackling small tasks—are working for you. Does that feel doable, and is there anything else you’d like to address before we wrap up today?

patient: I guess two weeks is... reasonable. The Sudoku’s helping a bit, if you ask me—it’s like forcing my brain to stay in one place, even if it’s slow. And the sink... I’ll get to it. Just need to find the right moment. Sleep’s still... well, you know. The 3 a.m. thing doesn’t really go away, but I’m learning to live with it, I suppose. Nothing else comes to mind right now. Thanks for not making me explain the cat situation.
