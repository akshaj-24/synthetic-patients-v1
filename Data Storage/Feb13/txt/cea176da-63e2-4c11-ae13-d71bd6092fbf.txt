system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that with me, Jordan. It takes courage to reach out. Would you be comfortable with me asking a few questions to better understand what you're going through?

patient: Sure, I guess. It’s just... been a rough few months, you know? The washing machine’s been giving me trouble, stupid rent hikes messing everything up. But I’ll manage, I always do.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to manage everything on your own. Would you be comfortable with me asking some questions to better understand what you're going through?

patient: I guess... it’s fine. Honestly, I’m just tired of thinking about it, you know? Work’s been a mess, and that damn washing machine still won’t stop leaking. I’ve been waking up at 3 a.m., staring at the ceiling... but it’s just stress, I’m sure. I’ll figure it out. Most people do, right?

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. Would you be okay with me explaining how this session will work so we can figure out the best way to support you?

patient: Yeah, sure. I guess... it’s whatever you think you need to do. Honestly, I just want to figure out how to stop feeling so... stuck. Like, I’m trying to handle things, but sometimes it feels like I’m just... going through the motions. The 3 a.m. thing? It’s not just the washing machine, I guess. But I’ll work through it. People always do, right?

interviewer: That sounds really frustrating. Do you have any questions about how this session will work before we proceed?

patient: No, I guess not. Just... whatever you need to do to help me stop feeling stuck. The 3 a.m. thing? I’ll work through it. People always do, right?

interviewer: It sounds like things have been really overwhelming for you lately. Can you tell me more about what you’re hoping to address or change through coming in for support right now?

patient: Honestly? I guess I just want things to... not feel so heavy all the time. The machine's been leaking for weeks and I keep forgetting to fix it, but that's stupid, right? People always do that—wake up in the middle of the night and stare at the ceiling. It’s not like there’s some big secret to figure out. Maybe I’m just getting old and... slower.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight you're carrying feels both emotional and practical—like that leaking machine that’s been neglected. When did you first notice things starting to feel this heavy, or was there a moment when it all felt like it shifted?

patient: I guess it started... maybe around the time the machine really started acting up. Before that, I was just tired, you know? But then there was that mess at work—some stupid mistake I made. After that, it felt like everything just... slowed down. Like gears grinding. I still try to keep going, though. Most people do, right?

interviewer: It sounds like the slowdown has been really challenging to live with. Can you share more about how this feeling of things grinding has affected your ability to manage daily tasks or responsibilities outside of work?

patient: Honestly? It’s like... trying to move through water. Cooking dinner feels like a project now. I’ll start heating up a TV dinner, then get distracted scrolling through my phone and forget about it. The other day, I realized I’d left a load of laundry in the machine for three days and just... stared at it like, 'How did this happen?' But I just let it sit. To be honest, I’m lucky I remember to shower most days. It’s not that I don’t try—I just feel like I’m running on two dead batteries.

interviewer: It sounds like the exhaustion and forgetfulness have been really disruptive—especially with work and self-care. What have you found yourself doing to manage these feelings of being stuck or overwhelmed?

patient: I guess... I just try to keep moving, you know? Like, I’ll hum along to classic rock on repeat in my head—it’s stupid, but it keeps me from... I don’t know, spiraling? And sometimes I’ll mess with those fabric swatches from work, arrange them in my pocket like... tiny puzzles. Doesn’t really help, but it’s something. To be honest, most days I just tell myself I’m ‘lucky’ to have a partner who doesn’t give up on me. It’s not much, but it’s all I can manage without feeling like things fall apart completely.

interviewer: It sounds like your partner’s support is a meaningful anchor for you amidst everything else. How has this experience been affecting your relationship or communication with them?

patient: It’s... complicated, I guess. They keep asking if I’m okay, and I just say ‘sure’ because I don’t want to make them worry. We’ve been arguing about stupid stuff lately—like the washing machine again. To be honest, I feel like I’m just... weighing them down. They say they’re lucky to have me, but I keep thinking I’m just not... worth the effort sometimes. It’s stupid, right?

interviewer: It sounds like the strain in your relationship has been adding to your sense of being overwhelmed. When did you first start feeling like you might be a burden to your partner?

patient: It’s hard to say exactly when, I guess… Maybe after that mess at work? You know, when I messed up the order. But it’s not like they’d actually say that. Probably just… stress. I mean, I can’t even fix the stupid washing machine before it starts leaking again. Rent hikes don’t help, you know? To be honest, I just count the minutes till I can crash. It’s not like they’d be better off without me or anything—ridiculous thought, right?

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure about being a burden, even if it feels unfair. Have you ever had thoughts about not wanting to be here anymore, or about something happening to you that would make things easier for your partner?

patient: Sometimes... I just think, what's the point? But it's not like I'd ever do anything, you know? I mean, they've got their own life. Probably better off if I just... handled things myself. Like fixing the washing machine before it floods the whole apartment. To be honest, I used to lie there at 3 a.m. thinking maybe I'd just... stop trying so hard. But it's stupid, right? I guess that's just exhaustion talking.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight you're carrying feels both emotional and practical—like that leaking machine that’s been neglected. When did you first notice things starting to feel this heavy, or was there a moment when it all felt like it shifted?

patient: I think it started creeping in after that work mistake, you know? Things just... slowed down after that. Like the machine, maybe? Once it starts leaking, you can’t just fix it with a Band-Aid. To be honest, I used to lie awake thinking about it—how I’d mess something up and then spend hours fixing it, only for it to break again. But I’m probably just overthinking. Rent hikes will do that to you, right?

interviewer: It sounds like the work mistake marked a turning point for you. Can you share when that mistake happened and how it initially affected your work routine or confidence?

patient: It was about six months ago, I think... Some order got mixed up, and I stayed late to fix it. But then I just started lying awake at 3 a.m., replaying it. You know how machines can sputter even after you fix them? That’s how I felt—like I’d just... break again eventually. To be honest, I started working longer hours to 'make up for it,' but it didn’t help. My partner says I’m over it, but I still check the washing machine at midnight, just in case.

interviewer: It sounds like this has been a really challenging time for you. Have you experienced episodes like this before, where you felt stuck or overwhelmed for an extended period?

patient: No, not really... This feels different. I guess before, when the washing machine used to break down, I’d just... deal with it. Fix it, I mean. But this time? It’s like everything’s been leaking for weeks. To be honest, my partner says they’ve never seen me like this. Guess they didn’t notice the smaller cracks, you know? I just... keep counting the minutes till it’s over.

interviewer: It sounds like this situation feels uniquely overwhelming compared to past challenges. Have there been any times in the past where you felt similarly stuck or emotionally exhausted, even if in a different context?

patient: I guess... maybe not exactly. Past stuff felt more... contained? Like, you fix the problem and move on. This is like the washing machine—small leaks adding up till the whole thing’s a mess. You just keep telling yourself it’ll hold, but it don’t, do you?

interviewer: I hear how the weight of these small stressors feels unmanageable now. Have there been other times in your life when things felt similarly overwhelming, even if the situations were different?

patient: Not really... Most things before felt like fixing a leak—plug it, move on. This is like the whole pipe’s rusted out, and you’re just... waiting for the floor to give way. I guess?

interviewer: I hear how this feels different from past challenges you've managed. Have there been other times when stressors built up gradually like this, even if they didn't feel as overwhelming at the time?

patient: I guess... maybe when I’d mess up at work before? Like, not big stuff, just little errors that piled up. But I’d usually catch them before they mattered. This feels different—like the errors are still small, but the fixing part… it’s just not happening. You know?

interviewer: It sounds like the shift from being able to fix things to feeling overwhelmed is really heavy for you. Have you noticed times in the past when you couldn’t fix something like this, and how did that feel at the time?

patient: I guess... maybe when the washing machine first started leaking? Thought I could just ignore it, you know? But now it’s like every little thing adds up. Feels like I’m just... waiting for the floor to cave in. Or maybe that work mix-up? Felt like I should’ve seen it coming. Guess I’m just getting old.

interviewer: I hear how the weight of these small stressors feels unmanageable now. What has been helping you cope with these stressors, even in small ways?

patient: Honestly? I just keep telling myself to power through. Humming songs on repeat helps, I guess—keeps the silence from eating me. And... I’ve been fiddling with these fabric swatches from work. Don’t even know why sometimes, but it’s something to do. Keeps the mind busy, I suppose.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and stuck right now. Have you thought about any specific ways to hurt yourself or end your life?

patient: I don’t think about it like... specific ways. Just sometimes when I don’t wake up, I guess. But it’s not like I’m planning anything. I’m more worried about fixing the washing machine before it floods the whole apartment. That’d be a mess, you know? It’s just... tiring, is all.

interviewer: I hear how the practical worries feel heavier right now. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or had a plan in the past, even if it wasn’t specific lately?

patient: No, I haven’t... I just... To be honest, I’ve been more focused on fixing the washing machine before it causes more damage. It’s been a hassle, but I guess that’s something I can actually do. Not like... other things.

interviewer: Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use lately?

patient: I haven’t touched alcohol in months. It just… stopped tasting like anything to me. Maybe I’m finally getting old. Cannabis? No, I haven’t messed with that. Just… not really into it. I’d rather deal with the washing machine than either of those, honestly.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about avoiding substances right now. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, or have you started or stopped any recently?

patient: No medications, not really my thing. I’ve tried a couple of those sleep aids before, but they just made me groggy the next day. To be honest, I’d rather deal with the washing machine than take pills. At least I know how to fix a leaky hose.

interviewer: It sounds like practical tasks feel more manageable than emotional ones right now. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or need very little sleep, even when you're stressed?

patient: No, I don’t get that. I just feel... drained. Even when I’m stressed, I’m still wiped out. Like those 3 a.m. nights—can’t go back to sleep, just lying there. I guess I’m just... slower these days. To be honest, even fixing the washing machine feels like battling a hurricane in a raincoat.

interviewer: I hear how even practical tasks feel overwhelming right now. Have you noticed any times when you've heard voices, seen things others don't, or had thoughts that feel strange or disconnected from reality?

patient: No, nothing like that. I mean... my head feels like static sometimes, you know? Like when the TV signal cuts out. But it’s probably just me being tired. I guess I worry more about the washing machine leaking than anything else. It’s stupid, but I can’t even bother to fix it anymore.

interviewer: Let me recap: You’ve described feeling overwhelmed by stressors like rent increases and unresolved household issues over the past three to six months, which have contributed to sleep disturbances, fatigue, and difficulty managing daily tasks. These challenges have affected your work performance and relationships, and you’ve shared passive thoughts about feeling stuck without a clear way forward. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You got most of it... I guess maybe you didn’t mention how I’ve been... saving these fabric swatches from work. It’s stupid, but it’s one of those little things I tell myself I’ll fix later. And my partner keeps saying they’re lucky, which just makes me feel like more of a burden, I guess. But it’s not a big deal, really.

interviewer: It sounds like the fabric swatches and your partner’s comments are part of the weight you’re carrying right now. Let me make sure I’ve captured everything: we’ve discussed sleep trouble, work stress, relationship strain, passive hopelessness, and these smaller but meaningful details like the swatches and how others’ words affect you. Is there anything else I’ve missed that’s important to include?

patient: No, that’s about it. I guess... the 3 a.m. wakeups are still there, but it’s probably just stress. The swatches? It’s stupid, but it’s one of those things I tell myself I’ll fix later. And the rent... I applied for a cheaper place, but I’ll probably mess that up too. It’s not a big deal, really.

interviewer: It sounds like the stressors you’re describing—like the 3 a.m. wakeups and the fabric swatches—are part of a bigger pattern of feeling overwhelmed and stuck. If I were to summarize, I’d say these challenges are adding up and making it harder to keep up with daily tasks and relationships. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You’re close, but maybe you didn’t catch how I just... stop caring sometimes. Like, I’ll hum old rock songs on repeat because it’s easier than picking a new one. And the fabric swatches? I guess it’s dumb, but arranging them feels like the only thing I’m good at anymore. Everything else just... drags. But it’s not a big deal, really.

interviewer: It sounds like the things we’ve covered include the stress from rent and work, the 3 a.m. wakeups, the fabric swatches becoming a focus, and how everything feels like a drag even though you’re trying to push through. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You didn’t mention how I secretly applied for a cheaper apartment, but I’ll probably mess that up too. And the humming... it’s just easier than picking new songs. Not a big deal, though.

interviewer: It sounds like the apartment application and humming songs are part of the pattern of feeling overwhelmed and struggling to engage with tasks. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: I guess... the apartment thing is just another thing piling up. I keep thinking I'll get it done but then... I don't know, it's like the machine all over again. The humming... it's not really helping, to be honest. Just something to do with my hands, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like the apartment application and the humming are both part of the same cycle of feeling overwhelmed and stuck. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: I guess... you’re not wrong about the apartment. It’s like the machine all over again, you know? Just something else I’m gonna mess up. The humming... it’s not even the songs anymore. Just noise to keep my hands busy. I don’t even remember why I started it. To be honest, I think I still save those fabric swatches from work. Doesn’t mean anything, though. Just... something to do.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now, but I appreciate you sharing so openly. Let's make sure we have a plan for next steps—how does scheduling a follow-up in two weeks sound to check in on how you're managing the apartment application and sleep? In the meantime, if you ever feel overwhelmed by thoughts of 'not waking up,' would you be okay with having my number to call even if it's just to talk through that static feeling?

patient: The follow-up in two weeks... I guess that’s fine. I’ll try not to mess up the apartment application this time. The humming’s still just noise, really. Doesn’t mean anything. I’ll... I’ll give you a call if the 3 a.m. stuff gets worse. Probably won’t, though. It’s just stress, right?

interviewer: It takes courage to navigate all this stress while keeping things moving forward. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to mention or clarify for our next steps?

patient: I guess... maybe the fabric swatch thing? Doesn’t mean anything, really. Just something to do with my hands when my head’s too quiet. And the 3 a.m. stuff... it’s just static, you know? I’ll figure it out. Probably.
