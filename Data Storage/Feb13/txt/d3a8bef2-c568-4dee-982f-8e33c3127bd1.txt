system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, John. It sounds like this has been a really challenging time for you. Do you feel comfortable continuing with this interview today?

patient: I guess... yeah, I can try. Just, uh, maybe take it easy if I need to pause? My legs keep... twitching, I guess you could say. And my head’s been doing that weird throb thing since last night. But I’ll, uh, I’ll power through. For the kids, right?

interviewer: Of course, John—I'm here to go at your pace. Are you comfortable proceeding with the interview today?

patient: Yeah, let’s... let’s keep going. I just need to, uh, cross my legs or else they’ll keep jumping. Feels like there’s a swarm of ants under my skin or something. And my head—*sighs, rubs temples*—it’s like that old record player that skips, you know? But I’ll focus. For the kids. They need me to... to *snaps fingers* *winces* ...stay sharp, right?

interviewer: It sounds like staying focused is really important for you. Before we begin, would you like to ask any questions about how this interview will work or what to expect?

patient: Hmm, not really... questions, I mean. It’s just, uh, will we... will we stick to a schedule? Like, no surprises? My hands are already shaking thinking about it. *rubs palms on legs* I guess I’m just worried I’ll space out or say something stupid. Again. But I’ll, uh, I’ll try not to mess this up. For the kids.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure you're under is really taking a toll. Have you experienced episodes like this before, where you felt overwhelmed by worry or physical symptoms?

patient: Yeah... it’s happened before. Like, with the chart error, but even before that I’d get stuck in my head. My legs feel like they’re full of static, and my brain just... loops the same track. *rubs neck, avoids eye contact* But I tell myself it’s just being ‘high-maintenance.’ My dad used to say that about everyone, so maybe it’s in my blood. *forces a flat smile* Can’t sleep much anyway, so maybe it’s just me being... broken in the usual way.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying this weight for a while, especially with your dad's influence shaping how you view these struggles. Have you ever sought professional help for these kinds of episodes before?

patient: I... I haven’t, really. My dad always said going to a therapist was for people who couldn’t fix their own problems. I just thought I had to... I don’t know, figure it out on my own. For the kids, you know? If I start unraveling, at least I can keep showing up. I mean, I take those sleep pills sometimes, but... that’s not exactly *professional* help, is it?

interviewer: It sounds like your dad's perspective left a strong mark on how you approach challenges. Can you share more about how his influence has shaped your way of handling stress or difficult emotions over the years?

patient: My dad... I guess I just learned to swallow it. Like, if I stayed late at work or brewed extra-strong chai, I could ‘outwork’ the bad stuff. But my legs won’t stop bouncing, and my head feels like a radio stuck on static. I tell myself, ‘Just be the steady thing for them,’ you know? For the kids. If I crack, who’ll hold the roof up? Even now, I freeze when I think about that insurance thing... but I’ll figure it out. Always do.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone. How has the stress around the insurance issue been affecting your daily functioning or ability to cope?

patient: It’s... it’s been rough. I’ve been staying later at work to ‘compensate,’ but my legs won’t stop jittering, and my head throbs like a bad radio. I take those pills to sleep, but I’m just... tired all the time. The numbers, the bills—it’s not like I can just stop worrying. For the kids, I have to... I have to keep going, right? Even if my brain feels like it’s short-circuiting.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to provide for your children is compounding your stress. Have you experienced any significant traumatic events or adversities in your life that might be contributing to how you handle stress or anxiety?

patient: I... I guess growing up, my dad’s temper taught me to keep my head down and not make waves. If I messed up, I just... absorbed it, you know? And the marriage—it was stormy, but I told myself I could handle it if I just worked harder. Now with the insurance thing... it’s like a weight in my chest. I can’t stop grinding my teeth about it. But I’ll figure it out. For the kids. I’m just... bad at adulting, I guess.

interviewer: That sounds like a lot to carry alone. Who have you leaned on for support during times like this, if anyone?

patient: I guess... my mom? But she’s got her own stuff, you know? She worries about me, but I don’t want to drag her into my mess. The kids—when they call, I try to act normal, like I’ve got it all together. But most days, I just... power through. Work’s predictable. The charts, the routines... they’re not perfect, but they’re something. I don’t exactly have a ‘support system.’ More like... a wall I keep building higher.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot on your shoulders right now. Have you been having any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life lately?

patient: No... not really. I mean, sometimes I get to thinking, like, what’s the point if I’m just going to mess everything up? But then I摸 my keychain, you know? The kids’ photo. Keeps me... grounded. It’s not like I want to or nothing. It’s just... the weight of it all. My legs won’t stop bouncing, though. Sorry.

interviewer: I notice you mentioned your legs won’t stop bouncing—how has that been affecting your daily routine? Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol use recently, like drinking more or less than usual?

patient: The bouncing... it’s like my legs have a mind of their own. At work, I’ll be filling out a form and my foot’s tapping so hard the pen slips. Tiring, you know? Drains me. I don’t drink, not really—I mean, maybe a beer at a family function, but nothing serious. My sleep... well, I’ll take a pill sometimes. Not that I’d tell my dad about that. He’d say I’m just looking for shortcuts again.

interviewer: I can see how trying to manage sleep while hiding it from your dad adds another layer of stress. How often are you taking these sleep pills, and do you know what kind they are?

patient: It’s... not something I track, honest. Just when the nights get too loud, you know? OTC stuff—label says ‘for occasional sleeplessness.’ My dad would call it ‘quitting early’ if he knew. I—I guess I take them maybe three nights a week? Sometimes more. My legs won’t stop jumping even after... after I take one. Feels like they’re arguing with me. (Pauses, adjusts keychain in pocket.) But it’s not a habit or nothing. Just... temporary.

interviewer: John, based on our conversation, it sounds like your anxiety and physical symptoms—like leg restlessness and trouble sleeping—have been building for a while, worsened recently by work stress and financial worries. These challenges seem tied to long-standing pressures around being a parent, avoiding letting people down, and a family history of dismissing mental health struggles. What did I miss or get wrong about how this has been unfolding for you?

patient: You didn’t mention the insurance thing with the kids... but I guess that’s just another thing I can’t fix. And the pills... well, they help a bit, but my legs still won’t stop jumping. I make the kids chai sometimes—it’s the only thing that feels... right. (Pauses, leg twitching under chair.) But it’s not like it matters. I’m just high-maintenance, like my dad said.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy load to carry alone... What did I miss about how these challenges—like the insurance stress or the way your body feels—are showing up in your daily life right now?

patient: The insurance thing... it’s like a weight on my chest, you know? I catch myself staring at the kids’ photo on my keychain just to breathe for a second. At work, my hands shake when I fill prescriptions—maybe I’m just slow these days. (Legs twitch under chair.) My dad would say I’m overreacting, but... (pauses, rubs neck) sometimes I wonder if my body’s just rebelling. The chai helps, but even that feels... off lately. Like the milk won’t stop curdling.

interviewer: John, it sounds like your anxiety and physical symptoms—like leg restlessness, shaking hands, and disrupted sleep—have been worsening over time, especially with the insurance stress and work pressures. These challenges are tied to a mix of long-standing family patterns (like dismissing mental health struggles) and recent stressors, while your focus on being a stable parent adds to the strain. What did I miss or get wrong about how this has been unfolding for you?

patient: I guess you hit most of the big stuff—insurance, work, the whole 'high-maintenance' shadow from my dad. What you might’ve missed is how the sleep aids have crept up... now I’m on three a night, but I tell myself it’s 'just to unwind.' And the keychain photo? It’s not just for show—when my legs start jumping like they’re trying to escape, I捏 it to ground myself. But yeah, maybe you got it right. I’m just... a mess of wires that can’t remember how to unplug. What else are you thinking?

interviewer: That sounds really challenging, like carrying a weight that keeps growing heavier. Let me recap: your anxiety and physical symptoms—like leg restlessness, sleep aids, and shaking hands—have been worsening due to work stress, insurance worries, and family patterns of dismissing mental health struggles. These issues impact your focus, sleep, and interactions with your kids, though you’re using rituals like the keychain photo to ground yourself. What did I miss or get wrong about how this feels for you right now?

patient: I guess... you didn’t mention how my hands shake when I’m filling out forms now. The nurse’s aide joked I’m ‘brewing chai again’ because of the tremor. And yeah, the pills help me sleep but my legs still jump like they’re rigged to a live wire. The kids... they don’t notice, but sometimes I catch them asking why I’m ‘tired so fast.’ I tell them it’s ‘work stress,’ but I’m just... adding to the noise. What else? Maybe you didn’t get how the insurance thing feels like a noose I can’t untie myself out of? But I guess that’s dramatic. What’s the point of saying it?

interviewer: John, it sounds like your physical symptoms—like the shaking hands when filling forms and restless legs—have become more noticeable at work, and the insurance stress feels suffocating. You’re also navigating the kids picking up on your fatigue, which adds to the pressure. What did I miss about how these layers are affecting you right now?

patient: I guess... you didn’t mention how the trembling makes me second-guess every task now. Yesterday, I spilled coffee on a chart because my hands wouldn’t stop shaking—it felt like everyone noticed. And the insurance thing? It’s like a weight in my chest that won’t lift, but I can’t tell the kids. I just smile through it, say ‘Daddy’s okay,’ even as my legs jump like they’re wired to a storm. Maybe you didn’t get how ashamed I am—like all this is my fault for being... brittle.

interviewer: John, it sounds like the shame you're carrying—feeling 'brittle' or like it's your fault for these struggles—is adding a layer of pain on top of everything else. Let me recap what I'm hearing: your anxiety, physical symptoms (trembling hands, restless legs, sleep issues), and stress over work/insurance are all tangled with a deep fear of letting your kids down, while the shame makes it harder to ask for help. What did I miss or get wrong about how all this feels for you right now?

patient: I guess... you didn’t mention how the shaking hands make me fear I’ll drop that photo keychain—like if it breaks, I’ve lost the last thing holding me together. And the shame? It’s not just the insurance or work... it’s this quiet voice saying I’m failing at being 'South Asian dad' too—staying up late making perfect chai, but my hands can’t even hold the cup steady now. What else? Maybe you didn’t get how the 'high-maintenance' label from my dad feels like it’s branded into my skin? But what’s the point of saying it? I’m just... a broken loop.

interviewer: John, it sounds like the shame around being a 'South Asian dad'—the pressure to provide stability through rituals like chai-making while your body betrays you—adds a layer of cultural and familial expectation to your distress. What else would be important to include about how these experiences are shaping your sense of self right now?

patient: I guess... it’s the chai, you know? My hands won’t steady for it anymore. My mom always said perfect masala means pride, but now I’m spilling it everywhere. The kids don’t say anything, but I see them watching—like they’re waiting for me to crack. And when I can’t even hold the cup... it’s like my dad’s voice all over again. 'High-maintenance,' he’d say. But what’s the point of talking? It’s just... another thing I’m messing up.

interviewer: John, it sounds like the cultural pressure to embody the 'South Asian dad' role—like making perfect chai—has become a symbol of your self-worth, and when your body betrays you, it triggers old wounds from your father’s criticism. What else would be important to include about how these experiences are shaping your sense of self right now?

patient: It’s not just the chai, I guess... It’s like my dad’s voice is always there, right? If I mess up the spices or the temperature, it’s proof I’m ‘high-maintenance.’ But... the kids, they don’t notice. They just want the taste. Me? I feel like I’m failing even at that. My hands shake when I try to measure the cardamom—same way they shake when I’m at work. It’s all connected, I think... but I don’t know how to fix it.

interviewer: John, it sounds like the cultural pressure to embody the 'South Asian dad' role—like making perfect chai—has become a symbol of your self-worth, and when your body betrays you, it triggers old wounds from your father’s criticism. What else would be important to include about how these experiences are shaping your sense of self right now?

patient: It’s... like the same thing that happens at work, right? My hands shake when I’m making chai, but I just tell myself ‘it’s not that important’—even though I know it is. My dad called me ‘high-maintenance’ for wanting to do things right, but now I’m stuck thinking, what if he was right? The kids don’t say anything, but I can tell they notice. I guess... I guess I’m just trying to prove I’m not a mess, even if my body won’t stop betraying me.

interviewer: John, it sounds like the cultural pressure to embody the 'South Asian dad' role—like making perfect chai—has become a symbol of your self-worth, and when your body betrays you, it triggers old wounds from your father’s criticism. What else would be important to include about how these experiences are shaping your sense of self right now?

patient: I... I guess it’s the way my body acts out what I can’t say. Like, when I’m making chai, my hands shake so bad the milk splashes—same way they shake when I fill out those insurance forms. My dad’s voice, that ‘high-maintenance’ thing... it’s like a needle scratching on a record. I can’t stop it. And now, I worry the kids see me fumbling and think... I don’t know, that I’m a mess they’ll have to clean up. But I just keep telling myself, ‘Stay late at work, do it right, be less of a burden.’ Even if my legs won’t stop jumping the whole time.

interviewer: John, it sounds like your body’s physical reactions—like trembling hands and restless legs—are deeply tied to both your work pressures and the emotional weight of living up to cultural expectations as a 'South Asian dad.' You’ve also described how your father’s critical voice still feels present, shaping your self-worth through things like making chai or filling out forms. What did I miss about how these patterns are showing up for you right now?

patient: I guess... there’s the way my brain never turns off, even when I’m trying to rest. Last night, I just... sat on the couch staring at the wall. My legs were jumping like they always do, but my head? It was like a broken jukebox—same songs, same static. I caught myself re-doing that insurance form in my head, line by line. And when I finally fell asleep? It was those dreams where I’m late to work, or the kids need me and I can’t move. I wake up with this tightness in my chest, like I’ve been holding my breath. It’s not just the big stuff. It’s... everything feels like a test I’m failing, even when I’m not taking it.

interviewer: John, based on what we’ve explored, it sounds like your experience involves anxiety-driven physical symptoms (restless legs, sleep disturbances, tremors), stress from work and family responsibilities, and a deep fear of failing your children while carrying the weight of intergenerational expectations. What did I miss about how these patterns feel for you, or is there something else you’d want to highlight before we discuss next steps?

patient: I guess... the money stuff with the insurance is a mess, but I just... I don’t know how to bring it up. And the pills—I take more than I should, but I tell myself it’s just to function. Even things like... like picking out school clothes for the kids feel like tests. What if I mess up? My legs won’t stop jumping the whole time.

interviewer: It sounds like carrying all these responsibilities while managing your body’s reactions has been incredibly heavy—especially when you’re trying so hard to be there for your kids. Do you have any final questions before we wrap up today?

patient: I guess not. I mean, I’ve been trying to figure things out on my own, you know? The pills help me sleep sometimes... but my body’s still got its own schedule. Probably just more questions I don’t know how to ask. For the kids, though—I’ll figure it out.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing all of this with me, John. I truly appreciate your courage in navigating these challenges while prioritizing your children. Before we finish, is there anything else you'd like to make sure we've covered today?

patient: No, I think that’s about it. I guess... my legs are still twitching like they’re trying to outrun something. The pills help me sleep, but my head’s still got this... static. For the kids, I’ll keep grinding. They don’t need to see the cracks, you know?
