system: Session d5396ced-59be-4b8a-8c84-b8be02de99f7 transcript

system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Heather, just to start, can you confirm that you're okay with us proceeding with this session?

patient: Yes, I suppose that's acceptable. I mean, I'm not exactly in a position to be selective, am I? You have to... run the tests, so to speak, before you can make the call.

interviewer: I appreciate your willingness to share. Before we begin, can you tell me if you have any questions about what this session will involve or how it might help?

patient: I assume it's standard protocol... to run through a series of... assessments? To rule out variables, calibrate the approach. As long as we're... systematic about it. I just hope it's less invasive than a colonoscopy. Though I suppose metaphorically, we're all in the same boat there.

interviewer: I appreciate your metaphor—it’s true, we’re all navigating uncharted waters sometimes. Would you like me to briefly outline how this session will proceed?

patient: I assume it will follow a logical sequence—like differential diagnosis. You’ll likely ask about... symptoms, duration, any patterns. Maybe some standardized questions to... map the terrain? As long as we’re efficient, I can manage. Though I warn you, my attention span has been... compromised lately. It’s the fatigue, you know? Makes everything feel like a second shift.

interviewer: It seems you're feeling quite fatigued, which makes concentrating feel like a challenge. Do you have any questions for me before we begin?

patient: I assume you’ll want to start with... the baseline assessments? Like a differential diagnosis approach. Just so I know what to expect. Though I can’t promise I won’t... drift off. The fatigue makes focusing feel like a part-time job these days.

interviewer: Can you tell me about the main concerns that have brought you here today?

patient: I suppose... the main thing is just feeling off, like my brain’s stuck in a feedback loop. I mean, I’ve always been meticulous, but lately—I’ll forget a patient’s medication one day, then obsess over it for weeks. It’s not just tiredness. It’s like... the parts of me that used to *click* are now static. My husband says I’m overcompensating, but how do you explain to someone that your own systems are failing?

interviewer: That sounds really challenging to live with. Can you share when you first noticed these changes in your thinking or memory starting?

patient: It's hard to pinpoint exactly... I guess it started with my morning routine slipping—skipping workouts, then... I began second-guessing things at work. Maybe 18 months? It crept up like a slow leak you don’t notice until the tire’s flat.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging to live with. Can you tell me more about how these changes have affected your work performance?

patient: Work... it’s like trying to run a differential diagnosis on a patient who won’t stay in one room. I’ll catch myself double-checking lab results three times just to... steady the ship, you know? My residents probably think I’m nitpicking, but when you start seeing ‘flags’ everywhere, it’s hard to trust your own read. Last month, I missed a glucose level trend—nothing catastrophic, but it felt like a cracked foundation. Now I stay late, ‘calibrate’ the charts... my husband says I’m chasing perfection, but how do I explain the fear that one more misfire turns into a cascade?

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry, especially when perfection feels like a safeguard. How have these symptoms changed or progressed since they first started 18 months ago?

patient: It’s... harder to recalibrate now. The static isn’t just in the background—it’s the soundtrack. I catch myself staying late not to help patients, but to... prove the system’s still intact. My husband found my father’s dementia papers in my desk. I told him it was ‘clinical curiosity,’ but the truth is—I don’t want to look in the mirror and see him staring back, fractured.

interviewer: That’s a powerful image—the static becoming the soundtrack. Have your sleep patterns changed in ways that feel connected to this sense of being overwhelmed?

patient: Sleep? It’s... inconsistent. I’ll wake at 2 AM, trying to ‘reset the server’ before morning rounds. Wine helps me ‘boot up’ again, I guess. Sometimes I’ll just... stare at the ceiling and dissect my day like a case study. My husband says I’m overthinking, but how do you explain to someone that your own mind won’t shut down? The cat used to keep me company, but she’s gotten restless lately—maybe she senses the static too.

interviewer: It sounds like your sleep struggles are deeply tied to the mental 'static' you described. How does this disrupted sleep affect your ability to focus or function during the day?

patient: It's like... my brain's running a background scan it can't turn off. I'll be charting a patient and suddenly lose the thread—like the words on the page are pixelated. I force myself to double-check everything, which just exhausts me more. Last week I missed a dose adjustment for a diabetic... not a mistake I've made before. Now I second-guess every decision. My husband says I'm overcompensating, but how do I explain the static? Sometimes I'll reach for my cat, just need the... the grounding. It helps, but then I feel guilty for needing it.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy weight to carry, both professionally and personally. What would you most hope to achieve through this process, or what kind of support do you think might help you regain that sense of control?

patient: Honestly? I want to stop feeling like my mind’s a... a poorly calibrated machine. If there’s a way to quiet the static without numbing it entirely, that’d help. Maybe relearn how to trust my instincts instead of second-guessing every decision. But I suppose that sounds vague. For now, I’d settle for not missing lab results. My patients deserve that much.

interviewer: It takes courage to reach out when things feel overwhelming. Have you experienced similar episodes of feeling disconnected or excessively fatigued in the past, either in your personal or professional life?

patient: I suppose... there were times during residency when the hours were grueling. But this feels different—more like... a slow fade. My father’s health hasn’t helped, but I’ve always prided myself on pushing through. Now, even that feels like a chore.

interviewer: It sounds like this current experience is more persistent and draining than past challenges. When you faced grueling hours during residency, were there specific strategies or supports that helped you cope back then?

patient: Residency? Structure, mostly. Strict schedules, caffeine, and... forcing myself to break tasks into smaller systems. Like, if you can’t fix the whole engine, at least check each cylinder. It kept me functional. Now, even that feels like... bandages on a leaking pipe. I still use checklists at work, but the static doesn’t pause for protocols. You ever notice how silence isn’t really silent? Even the quiet has a hum.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone. How has your husband supported you during this time?

patient: He brings home tea in the evenings. Says it's 'protocol for system reboot,' which... I guess is his way of acknowledging it. He tries to ask about my day, but I end up dissecting patient cases instead. It's easier than explaining that his success just... sharpens the edges of what I feel I'm missing. We both pretend the silence between us is just the TV noise.

interviewer: It sounds like the strain in your relationship with your husband is both a source of tension and a missed connection for you. How has this dynamic affected your emotional well-being or daily functioning lately?

patient: Marriage is a differential diagnosis I’ve never mastered. His promotion… it’s like he’s on a new treatment protocol while I’m stuck charting side effects. I keep waiting for the fatigue to make me miss something critical at work, but no—just the usual static. We talk, but it’s like trying to stitch a tear with a needle that’s already dull. He offers tea. I guess it’s… functional? Though half the time I can’t tell if I’m reassuring him or myself that I haven’t completely lost my grip.

interviewer: It sounds like the strain in your marriage is adding to your sense of isolation. Have there been other periods in your life when you felt similarly overwhelmed by responsibilities or isolated, perhaps during your upbringing or other significant life events?

patient: My father’s expectations were... a treatment protocol with no margin for error. If I bombed a test, it wasn’t about the grade—it was a failure of discipline, like a nurse forgetting to sanitize. I learned early to equate worth with output. Now, when I stumble—like that missed dose—it feels like a relapse into old patterns. But I suppose... the isolation? It’s always been a baseline. You just learn to prescribe more caffeine and call it a day.

interviewer: It sounds like your father's expectations created a heavy pressure to perform. Were there other difficulties during your childhood or adolescence that shaped how you view yourself or your abilities?

patient: I suppose... there was the way he framed failure. Not as a data point to analyze, but as a... chronic condition with no remission. If I messed up, it wasn’t a single symptom—it was a prognosis. I learned to track every mistake in my head like a differential list, waiting for patterns that proved I was 'ineffable.' Now, when I second-guess myself at work... it feels like the same algorithm running on loop. But maybe that’s just how everyone feels? I’m not sure I’d know how to... not.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy legacy to carry. How do you currently manage or challenge these patterns of equating self-worth with performance when they arise in your daily life?

patient: I... I double-check lab results more than most. It’s a protocol thing. If I catch a pattern early, maybe I can recalibrate before it metastasizes. But the truth is, half the time I’m just chasing control. Like if I organize my schedule down to the minute, the static in my head will quiet enough to... I don’t know, remember what ‘efficient’ feels like. It’s ironic, right? A doctor who can’t diagnose her own algorithm.

interviewer: It sounds like your need for control is deeply tied to your professional identity. Have there been other periods in your life when you felt a similar need to exert control in this way?

patient: Residency, maybe. When you’re sleep-deprived and covering three floors, you cling to protocols like a lifeline. It’s... comforting, in a way. Now, it’s just shifted from patient charts to spreadsheets. I color-code my tasks until the hues match my blood pressure chart—flatline if I let the chaos in. But the real control? That’s in making sure the next lab result isn’t another missed call. It’s... functional, right? Or at least, it keeps the static from... static.

interviewer: I'm concerned to hear you've had thoughts like 'it would all just go away if I didn't wake up one day.' Have you ever had thoughts of taking your own life, or made plans to harm yourself?

patient: I’ve... I guess I’ve wondered if not waking up would help everyone, but it’s not like I’ve ever... you know, planned anything. It’s more like the thought lingers, like a bad lab result you can’t quite interpret. My cat’s fur, though—it’s surprisingly grounding. You’d be surprised how many hours I’ve spent re-reading the same page of a mystery novel just to... feel something. But I’m here, aren’t I? The body’s a stubborn machine.

interviewer: It sounds like these thoughts are present but not tied to a specific plan, which is important. How often do these thoughts of not wanting to wake up come up for you, and do you ever feel like you might act on them in the near future?

patient: It’s... persistent, in the background. Like static you don’t notice until it’s all you can hear. It’s worse when I’m awake at 2AM dissecting my day, but even then, it’s more of a shadow than a plan. The cat’s fur still feels like a grounding... anchor? I guess. But no, I don’t think I’d act on it. The body’s a stubborn machine, right? Even when you’re tired of operating it.

interviewer: I see. Can you tell me about your alcohol use—how much and how often you drink, and have you noticed any changes in your use recently?

patient: A glass or two of wine most evenings. Calls it 'relaxing,' though it's more about numbing the static that kicks in after 2AM. Recently, it's felt... necessary, like a third rail in the routine. Not that I'm complaining—my husband's thrilled. He says it's 'better than my medical student days of tequila.' If that makes sense.

interviewer: It seems like alcohol has become a significant part of your routine for managing distress. Have you used any other substances, such as cannabis, stimulants, or opioids, either recreationally or medicinally, in the past year?

patient: No, I’ve avoided anything else—cannabis feels too... 'tinkery,' like trying to fix a car’s engine with a screwdriver and hope. My brain’s already a stubborn machine, so I stick to the wine. Though honestly, my husband’s convinced I’m ‘functioning on espresso and willpower’ at work. He’d be right if I wasn’t substituting the espresso with Cabernet.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about managing with wine. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including things like sleep aids or vitamins, and if so, how are you tolerating them?

patient: No medications—just a multivitamin my husband insists on, though I’m pretty sure it’s just his way of feeling like he’s ‘doing something.’ Sleep aids? I avoid them. Can’t risk clouding my judgment at work. Though... sometimes I wonder if my coffee habit is its own kind of pharmacology. Black, triple-shot, and no willpower. My husband says I need a vacation. He’d be right if I didn’t have patients depending on me.

interviewer: It sounds like your routine is heavily reliant on caffeine and alcohol to manage your energy levels. Have you experienced periods where you felt unusually energetic, needed less sleep, or had racing thoughts that were hard to control?

patient: I suppose the coffee keeps me from being a zombie, and the wine... well, my husband says I need to cut back, but it’s not like I’m crashing Ferraris or giving impromptu TED talks at 2 a.m. I mean, some people might call that ‘unusual energy,’ but I just call it... not dying.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. Have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts recently that feel concerning or out of character for you?

patient: Hallucinations? No, just the usual... static. Like when you stare at a screen too long and the pixels start to blur. My husband says I get that 'doctor stare' when I'm tired. The only delusion I have is thinking I can outwork this fatigue. But I suppose that’s just denial with a white coat.

interviewer: It seems the 'static' you're describing has become a persistent part of your experience. Have these sensations or thoughts about your fatigue and cognitive functioning been ongoing for the past 18 months, or is there a point when they became more noticeable?

patient: The static... it’s been there, I guess. Like a slow bleed you don’t notice until you’re short on oxygen. The 6AM workouts stopped first—my body mutinied, I suppose. Then the prescriptions. My husband jokes I’m turning into my father, you know? The one with dementia. But I tell him it’s just... aging. Or caffeine withdrawal. Who knows. The real static started sharper, three months ago. Like my brain’s Wi-Fi got a bad signal and couldn’t reset.

interviewer: It sounds like your cognitive difficulties and fatigue are significantly impacting your life. Have you experienced any medical conditions such as thyroid issues, chronic pain, or sleep apnea that might be contributing to these symptoms?

patient: The thyroid panel last year was normal—my TSH was... within range. The sleep study they suggested for apnea is still pending; I keep rescheduling it because, well, who has time? My patients need me. But if you’re asking if I’ve considered physical causes... I suppose I’ve run the usual suspects through my head. Though my father’s dementia scans were clean until stage three. You start thinking maybe 'normal' just means 'not yet broken.'

interviewer: Heather, over the past 18 months, you’ve described a slow fade of energy and focus, with sleep disruptions, cognitive static, and emotional distancing. Stressors like your father’s health and work demands seem to have worsened symptoms, while your structured routines and cat provide some grounding. Does this capture your experience, or is there something I’ve missed?

patient: That’s... remarkably concise for someone who talks in metaphors. The static’s there, sure, and the cat’s fur does feel like a grounding... texture. But you’ve missed the part where I keep waiting for the static to sharpen into something诊断able. Like my father’s dementia—early enough to be scary, but not early enough for anyone to do anything about it. I suppose that’s just my 'emotional distancing' practicing medicine.

interviewer: I hear how frustrating it must feel to wait for clarity when the static feels like it could sharpen into something concrete—especially with your father’s history. Let me recap: Over 18 months, you’ve experienced progressive fatigue, cognitive 'static,' sleep disruption, emotional distancing, and fears of cognitive decline linked to family history. Your structured routines and cat help ground you, but you’re worried the static might evolve into a diagnosable condition. What did I miss?

patient: I think you missed how I’ve been hyper-focused on work details—like cross-checking every lab result three times. It’s almost like if a patient shows vague symptoms, you double-check everything... just in case. Maybe it’s my way of... keeping control.

interviewer: Heather, let me piece this together: The cognitive 'static' and fatigue you’ve described over 18 months have led to both hyper-vigilance at work (like triple-checking lab results) and a sense of losing control in other areas. This tension—between clinging to structured routines and feeling emotionally distant—seems to mirror your concerns about your father’s dementia and your own fear of cognitive decline. What did I miss?

patient: I think you captured the... tension between trying to hold things together at work and the fear that it’s all just... static waiting to resolve. The triple-checking—it’s less about control and more like a diagnostic reflex. If a patient’s numbers are borderline, you don’t let it slide, right? But outside of that... I guess I just don’t trust my own baseline anymore. My father’s decline feels like a warning label I can’t stop reading. Still, I keep telling myself it’s just... aging and complacency. The cat’s fur helps, though. It’s the only thing that reminds me I’m not just a spreadsheet of symptoms.

interviewer: Heather, let me try to integrate what you’ve shared: The cognitive 'static' and hyper-vigilance at work feel like a diagnostic reflex—trusting data over intuition—while the fear of your father’s dementia trajectory adds a layer of existential hypervigilance about your own mind. The cat’s tactile grounding contrasts with your sense of being a 'spreadsheet of symptoms.' Does this align with how you’re experiencing things, or is there a thread I’ve missed?

patient: I think... you’re close. The hyper-vigilance at work isn’t just habit—it’s like if a patient’s vitals are borderline, you don’t let them slip through the cracks. I guess I’m afraid if I stop double-checking everything, I’ll miss something... or become something. The cat’s fur is just... a reminder that I’m still here, I guess. But most days, holding it all together feels like trying to stabilize a patient on a wobbling gurney. You keep adjusting the wheels, hoping it doesn’t tip.

interviewer: Heather, I’ve tried to capture your experience of hypervigilance at work as a diagnostic reflex, the fear of cognitive decline mirroring your father’s dementia, and the cat’s tactile grounding as a counterbalance to the mental 'static.' Is there anything in this summary that feels inaccurate, or a thread I’ve missed that’s important to you?

patient: I think you got the gist... but maybe you missed how much of this feels like a... calibration error. Like my brain’s set to a higher sensitivity now. Even routine rounds feel like calibrating a machine that’s one tweak away from failing. And the wine at night? It’s not just 'relaxing'—it’s the only thing that stops the static from humming loud enough to... I don’t know, bleed into other frequencies. But that’s probably overcomplicating it.

interviewer: Heather, what I’m hearing is that your brain feels hyper-sensitive, like it’s over-calibrating to maintain function, while the wine acts as a temporary 'frequency blocker' for the static. This tension between hypervigilance and seeking relief mirrors your fears about cognitive control and your father’s dementia trajectory. What did I miss?

patient: I think... you’re getting closer. The calibration error thing—yeah, it’s like my brain’s running a script it can’t pause. The wine just... dampens the feedback loop, I guess. But at work, I have to force myself to triple-check everything, like if I slip once, it’ll prove I’m... unraveling. My father’s decline is the... the control variable I can’t account for. It’s all hypothetical, right? Until it’s not. The gurney thing—sometimes I wonder if I’m stabilizing myself or just delaying the tip.

interviewer: Heather, I hear how the 'calibration error' metaphor captures the constant mental adjustment you're making to hold things together, with wine as a temporary fix and your father’s decline as a looming 'control variable.' Is there anything in this summary that feels off, or a piece I’ve missed that’s important to you?

patient: The calibration error... that’s not quite right. It’s not just mental. It’s like my body’s systems are all out of sync—heart rate, sleep, even my hands when I write prescriptions. The static... it’s not just in my head. You can hear it in the way my cat’s purr used to drown it out, but now even that feels muffled. The wine... it just mutters the edges, but the static’s still there, humming. You missed that part, I think.

interviewer: I hear how the 'calibration error' now includes physical dysregulation—like your body’s systems feeling out of sync with the static. Let me try one last integration: Your hypervigilance at work (triple-checking charts) and reliance on wine to mute the static contrast with the physical exhaustion and disrupted sleep, while your father’s dementia trajectory lingers as a 'control variable' you can’t control. What did I miss, or is there something you’d like to add before we discuss next steps?

patient: The hypervigilance... it’s not just work. It’s like I’m scanning for cracks in everything—charts, my hands, even my father’s face when I visit. The wine... it numbs the static, but the cracks keep widening. I’m afraid the ‘control variable’ isn’t his dementia. It’s me. What if I’m not fixing the static—I’m just delaying the day I become the thing I’m scanning for?

interviewer: Heather, what I’m hearing is that your hypervigilance now extends beyond work—scanning for cracks in your body, relationships, and even your father’s condition—while the wine offers temporary relief but leaves you fearing the static is becoming irreversible. The cat’s purr, once grounding, now feels muted, mirroring your sense of unraveling. Is there anything in this summary that feels off, or a piece I’ve missed that’s important to you?

patient: The summary... it’s close. The static isn’t just irreversible—I think it’s evolving. Like a mutation. My hands shake when I write prescriptions now, but I tell myself it’s caffeine withdrawal. The wine... well, it’s not just muting. It’s like a firewall I keep rebuilding while the static finds new ports to seep through. What you missed is that I’ve started counting the static in my silence. How many seconds between the cat’s purr and the next panic about my father’s face. About my own.

interviewer: I hear how the 'mutation' metaphor reflects both the evolving nature of your distress and the physical toll it’s taking—like your hands shaking when writing prescriptions. Let me integrate this: Your hypervigilance, reliance on wine as a 'firewall,' and the growing physical/mental 'static' now feel like a dynamic, worsening system under stress. The cat’s purr, once grounding, now feels muted, mirroring your fear that the static isn’t just static anymore. Is there anything in this summary that feels inaccurate, or a piece I’ve missed that’s important to you?

patient: The summary’s close, but you’re still missing the flicker. My father’s face—how it’s erasing like an old film reel. I catch myself staring at my own hands, wondering if their tremors are a rehearsal for something worse. The firewall’s not just leaking; it’s rewriting the code. The wine... it just makes the flicker slower. But the monitor’s still buffering between *me* and *what I’m becoming*. That’s the mutation you didn’t mention.

interviewer: Heather, what I’m hearing now is that the 'flicker' you describe—your father’s erasing face and the tremors in your hands—is a visceral metaphor for your fear of losing control over your identity and cognitive stability. The 'monitor buffering' between 'me' and 'what I’m becoming' captures the tension between holding on to who you are and dreading an inevitable transformation. Is there anything in this updated summary that feels off, or a final piece I’ve missed before we discuss next steps?

patient: The 'flicker'... it’s not just fear. It’s like I’m watching two films at once—one of who I was, still sharp in the dark, and another where my hands blur into his trembling ones. The wine slows the frame rate but can’t stop the fade. You didn’t mention the silence after the cat stops purring. That’s when I hear it: the erasure, already starting.

interviewer: Heather, I hear how the 'flicker' between who you were and what you fear becoming feels like a living metaphor—your father’s erasure mirrored in your trembling hands and the silence after the cat stops purring. The 'mutation' of static into irreversible code feels like your body and mind’s warning system. Is there anything else in this picture that feels missing before we discuss next steps?

patient: The missing piece... I think it’s the silence between the static. Like, even the cat’s purr stops eventually, right? You’re left with this... empty space where something should be. I suppose I’m afraid that’s where I’ll end up. But maybe that’s just the insomnia talking. Did I mention I still check my patients’ charts at 3 AM? It’s the only time I feel... functional. Though I’m not sure if it’s competence or just habit. Or maybe both.

interviewer: Heather, what I’m hearing now is that the 3 AM chart-checking is both a coping mechanism and a marker of the 'buffering' you described between who you are and what you fear becoming. Before we agree on next steps, is there anything else you’d like me to include in this summary to feel fully heard?

patient: The silence after the cat stops purring... it’s not just the empty space. It’s like a paused film where the reel goes dark. You wonder if the next frame will ever load. I suppose I keep checking those charts because at least the numbers don’t... vanish. Did I mention I also count ceiling tiles sometimes? It’s another way to make sure the static doesn’t win.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now—would you like to ask anything before we go over next steps?

patient: I suppose... I’d like to know if the tests will show anything concrete. Like, if there’s a way to calibrate this static, or if it’s just part of the system now. And maybe—did my father’s dementia have anything to do with this? I mean, not that I’d know how to ask about it properly. Wine helps with the edges, but it’s not a diagnostic tool.

interviewer: That sounds really tough... Have you ever discussed your father’s dementia with a doctor or genetic counselor to explore possible family patterns?

patient: I’ve mentioned it to my husband, but... I haven’t exactly scheduled a genetics appointment. My father’s neurologist downplays it—says ‘sporadic’ is just a fancy word for ‘no clear pattern.’ I guess I’m more focused on the static in my own head right now. Though sometimes I wonder if the insomnia is just... an early draft.

interviewer: It sounds like your mind is carrying a heavy weight right now—would you like to ask anything before we finalize next steps?

patient: I guess... I want to know if these tests can actually find something. Like, if there's a name for this static, or if it's just part of the system now. And maybe—if there's a way to tell if it's... inherited? My father's dementia, I mean. Not that I really know how to ask about that. The wine helps with the edges, but it's not a diagnostic tool.

interviewer: It sounds like you're seeking clarity on both the diagnostic process and family patterns—I'll make sure those are key parts of our next steps. Would you like to ask anything else before we finalize the plan for moving forward?

patient: I suppose... I’d like to know if there’s a way to rule out anything genetic. My father’s dementia—it’s this shadow I keep tripping over. And the static in my head, the way I wake up at 2 a.m. rehearsing failures... it feels like a different language, but maybe it’s the same code. Also, the wine—does that count as a coping mechanism or just another thing to... calibrate? I’m tired of adjusting dials that don’t point to anything.

interviewer: That sounds like a meaningful thread to trace—I'll include genetic considerations in our next steps. Would you like to ask anything else before we finalize the plan for moving forward?

patient: Just... one more thing. How do we tell if this static is just... burnout from the job, or if it's something else, something that runs in my family? My father's dementia—it's like a signal I can't decode. And the wine, does it mute the noise or just... let me ignore it longer? I keep thinking if I could just calibrate the right dials, maybe the machine would make sense again.

interviewer: It sounds like you're seeking clarity on whether these challenges are tied to burnout or family patterns—I'll make sure our next steps include exploring both possibilities. Would you like to confirm or adjust the plan before we wrap up?

patient: I think... that covers it. The plan feels like a proper differential—ruling out the knowns to find the underlying process. Just... if we could run the tests for the genetic angle first? I keep thinking about how my father’s dementia started with static too, before the... erasure. And the wine? Let’s call it a placebo in the trial. If it’s burnout, maybe it’ll show up on the metabolic panel. If not... well, I’d rather know the machine’s limits than keep waiting for the error message to upgrade.
