system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Are you comfortable proceeding with this interview today?

patient: Yeah, I mean... it’s just another task, right? Like, I’ve got to get through it. Been a rough few months with work and my mom’s health—uh, you know how that goes. Just... let’s get started.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed lately. This interview will involve discussing your current concerns to better understand what's going on. Does that sound okay?

patient: Yeah, I guess... it’s just another project to tackle, you know? As long as we stick to the plan and don’t, uh, overload the system. Been running on about five hours a night since Mom’s surgery, so... my focus is a little shaky. But I’ll power through. Most of the time, it’s just the usual stuff—work deadlines, her bills, trying not to mess up the parts list. You prioritize what you can.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging—juggling so much while feeling physically drained. Do you have any questions about how this interview will go before we start?

patient: No, I think we’ve got the blueprint laid out. Just... make sure we don’t skip any steps. I’ve got too much on the line at work and with my mom’s care to mess this up. You know how it is—every detail matters when the system’s already... strained.

interviewer: Can you describe, in your own words, what’s been most troubling you lately and how it’s been affecting your daily life?

patient: It’s... the constant tension, you know? Like a circuit that won’t reset. At work, I catch myself double-checking parts lists three times—wasting hours—but if I don’t, what if I mess up and it costs the company? Then there’s Mom’s bills. I’ve been paying them late at night when I can’t sleep, but the numbers... they don’t add up. My partner says I’m snapping at her lately, but I’m just trying to stay focused. The other day, I forgot her birthday again. It’s like this leak under the sink—I keep meaning to fix it, but by the time I get there, something else breaks. Um... you know how it is when the system’s already... strained.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight of these responsibilities is taking a toll on you. When did this tension and stress first start becoming a problem for you?

patient: It... it started creeping in maybe eight months ago? Around when Mom’s back acting up again and I took on the supervisor role. At first, I told myself it was just juggling more plates, but then... then little things started stacking like a leak under the sink you keep ignoring. I’d lie awake calculating spreadsheets in my head. The anniversary thing—well, that was a crack, I guess. But I’m used to pressure. Machines hold together under stress, right? People should too.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the demands on your time and energy. What are you hoping we can work on together to help with these challenges?

patient: I guess... I don’t know. Maybe figure out how to stop the static from eating my head? I can’t shut it off, you know? Like a circuit that won’t reset. I want to focus on what matters—Mom, the job, not missing the little things. But it’s like the leak under the sink—no matter how hard I try, it seeps through. I just... need to not be so exhausted all the time.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry every day. How has this constant mental static been affecting your ability to manage tasks or responsibilities that used to feel manageable?

patient: It’s like... circuits overloading, you know? I’ll spend extra time double-checking parts just to quiet the noise, but then it eats into my shifts. Last week I mislabeled a component—small thing, but it felt like a crack in the whole system. My hands get this... tightness. And focus? It’s like trying to water plants with a leaky hose—half goes where it’s needed, half just... disappears. I forgot to order supplies for the team twice this month. To be honest, I’m just waiting for the supervisor role to come back and bite me.

interviewer: I can see how the pressure from work and caregiving has been really heavy lately. Have you experienced similar episodes of stress or anxiety in the past, where things felt this overwhelming?

patient: I... I’ve always handled stress, you know? Like an engine—friction’s normal, right? But past stuff? Maybe when the plant downsized in 2016... that was rough. I kept my head down, learned new systems. But this? This feels different. Mom’s bills, the team relying on me... it’s not just pressure. It’s like a motor running nonstop—your hands get this... tightness. Can’t remember the last time I slept through the night. But I’ve managed before, so why not now? Maybe I’m just... older. Systems fail, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like the 2016 plant downsizing was a significant stressor for you. When that happened, did you experience feelings or physical sensations similar to what you’re describing now, like the 'motor running nonstop' or the tightness in your hands? What strategies helped you get through that period?

patient: 2016? Yeah, that was rough, but it was more like... a hard reset. I had to reprogram everything, you know? Focused on learning new systems, kept my head down. No sleep, sure, but it had an end. This? This is like a motor that won’t shut off. Back then, the tightness in my hands would ease after a shift. Now? It’s constant. I guess I just... forced myself to keep moving before. But now even that feels like propping up a broken pipe with duct tape. It holds for a while, then... leaks everywhere.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy contrast between past and present. When you had to 'reprogram everything' in 2016, what specific strategies or supports helped you keep going through that period?

patient: Um, in 2016... I think it was just, you know, forcing myself to break everything down into steps. Like, the manual for the new machinery—it had this troubleshooting section. I’d read it cover to cover, then rewrite the key points in my notebook. Made me feel like I had some control. And my sister, she’d call every Sunday to... I don’t know, keep me from getting stuck in my head? But that’s the thing, right now? There’s no manual for what’s happening with Mom’s bills or why I keep missing the little stuff that actually matters. You know what I mean?

interviewer: It sounds like your sister’s check-ins helped you feel grounded during the 2016 stress. Who are you relying on for support with your current challenges—Mom’s care, work pressures, or relationship strain?

patient: Ugh. My sister... she calls, yeah. But it’s just her asking about Mom’s pain scale or if I’m eating. She means well, but it’s like she’s reading a script. You know how she gets. And my partner—look, I appreciate her trying to act like everything’s ‘fine,’ but it’s exhausting. I just... I can’t explain it. My shoulders are killing me today. Maybe I should just focus on the job. At least the machines don’t lie to me.

interviewer: It sounds like focusing on work is a way you're trying to manage the weight of everything right now. Can you tell me more about how you've been handling the physical tension in your body, like the tightness in your shoulders, when it becomes overwhelming?

patient: Ugh. The shoulders? I just... I’ll heat it up with that cheap pad from the drugstore. Works for, like, an hour. Then it’s back to knots. I try to stretch during lunch, but the minute I sit down at my desk, it’s like the tension just... rebuilds. You know what really sucks? My partner suggests yoga or something, but how am I supposed to ‘breathe through it’ when the whole system’s already leaking? I just power through. If the job’s done right, at least that part’s under control. But... *[sighs, rubs neck]* ...it’s always there. Even now. My sister says I’m ‘clenching my whole life,’ but what’s the alternative?

interviewer: I want to check on your well-being. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life in the past few months?

patient: No, I haven’t... I mean, not really. I get so tired sometimes I just wanna shut down, like a machine overheating. But that’s different, right? My sister says I need to ‘stop running on fumes,’ but what else am I supposed to do? The bills keep coming, Mom’s doctors keep adding stuff to her list… I just… I focus on the things I can fix. Like the chili plants. They’re doing okay. The sink leak? Still there. But I’ll get to it eventually.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight right now. Have you been using alcohol, cannabis, or any other substances more or less than usual to cope with the stress?

patient: Ugh. I mean... I’ve had a drink more nights than I should. Just to, you know, quiet the static enough to sleep. But it’s not like I’m out partying or anything. My sister says I’m ‘numbing the leaks,’ but work’s so damn demanding. If I screw up even a little, they’ll just replace me like the 2016 downsizing. Cannabis? No. I need my hands steady for the equipment. And the chili plants—*sigh*—they’d die if I let my mind go completely blank.

interviewer: I hear how the alcohol helps you sleep but adds to the pressure about work and responsibilities. How many drinks are you having on those nights, and do you notice any effects the next day—like fatigue or trouble focusing?

patient: Um... it’s not like I’m drinking hard liquor or anything. Maybe two, three beers at most. The next day I feel... like a machine that’s been running nonstop. Headache, shaky hands—my partner says I’m ‘jittery as a mouse in a blender.’ You know how it is, right? Everyone’s stressed. I just... I water the chili plants extra that morning to focus. Keeps my hands busy.

interviewer: It sounds like the alcohol’s leaving you feeling physically unsteady. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels lately—like feeling unusually restless or wired, even when you’re tired?

patient: It’s like... the motor’s running too fast, you know? Even when I’m exhausted, my head’s still on high gear. My hands... they shake even when I’m trying to fix the leak under the sink. Feels like I’m wired on caffeine, but I haven’t had any. You’d think after 10 hours of work, I’d just crash, but my brain’s still scanning for problems. Mom’s bills. The parts list. My partner’s texts. It’s not the alcohol, though. That’s just... background noise.

interviewer: It sounds like your body’s trying to keep up with a system in overdrive. Have you noticed if this restlessness or heightened energy has made you feel more productive or like you need less sleep than usual?

patient: I don’t know... it’s not like I’m getting more done. My hands are always twitching, like they’re trying to fix something even when I’m just sitting. I guess I do stay up later checking the parts list or Mom’s bills, but when I finally sleep, it’s... static. You wake up from it, right? Like your body’s still on ‘high gear.’ The next day, I’m dragging, but I can’t stop. It’s like a machine that’s stuck in repair mode—fixing leaks that aren’t even there sometimes.

interviewer: It sounds like your body’s in a constant state of repair. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or restless, even when you're not getting enough sleep?

patient: Unusually energetic? I don’t know... It’s like the motor’s stuck on ‘overheat,’ you know? My hands... they’re always twitching, even when I’m trying to sleep. I’ll lie there, mind scanning Mom’s latest bill or the parts list, and my fingers flex like they’re tightening bolts that aren’t even there. You’d think exhaustion would shut it down, but it’s more like... static. The other night, I was watering the chili plants at 2 a.m., just to keep my hands busy. Not energy. Just noise.

interviewer: It sounds like your sleep cycle feels disrupted, almost like a system with a short circuit. Have you noticed that you need less sleep than usual to function, or do you find yourself staying up longer because you feel compelled to stay active?

patient: No, I don’t sleep less. It’s more like... the system won’t shut down. My hands keep moving even when I’m tired. Last night, I was still checking the parts list at 1 a.m.—my fingers were twitching like they were tightening bolts. You know how it is. If I don’t stay on top of it, things just... leak.

interviewer: It sounds like your restlessness is affecting your physical and mental state even during rest. Have you noticed any periods where you’ve felt unusually energetic or had a lot more energy than usual, even when you’re tired?

patient: I guess... sometimes I’ll push through when I’m exhausted, like a motor running on fumes. You know, when Mom’s bills are due or the equipment’s backed up, I’ll work 10-hour days even if my neck’s killing me. But it’s not really ‘energy’—it’s just... not stopping. My body’s tight as a coiled spring, but I can’t afford to let it unwind. Last week I fixed three machines in a row without sitting down. Doesn’t mean I don’t feel like collapsing afterward. Um... maybe that’s what you’re pointing at?

interviewer: It sounds like pushing through exhaustion is a way to hold things together, even when it’s unsustainable. Have you ever noticed times when you feel so energized or restless that you can’t slow down—even when it might not be wise to keep going?

patient: Energized? Not really. It’s more like... my mind’s stuck in the 'on' position. You know how old motors hum even when they’re not moving? That’s it. Last night, I fixed the sink leak by hand because the parts weren’t in yet. My fingers were shaking, but I couldn’t stop—like if I did, the whole house would flood. My partner says I’m overcompensating. Maybe. But it’s not 'energy.' It’s just... not allowing myself to freeze up. Even when my neck feels like it’s rusted shut.

interviewer: It sounds like your restlessness is driving you to act even when your body is exhausted. Have you noticed any periods where you feel so compelled to keep working on tasks—like fixing things or organizing lists—that you neglect basic needs like eating or sleeping, even when it’s not practical?

patient: I guess... last week I skipped lunch three days straight because I was troubleshooting a parts order. My neck’s been so tight I can’t even feel my jaw, but I kept going. It’s like a machine that won’t shut down—once you start the cycle, you just keep running until the parts wear out. You know? My partner says I’m ‘burning the circuit board,’ but it’s not like I’ve got a choice. Mom’s latest bill came in yesterday. I need to fix this before it backs up again. I’m just... not sleeping much. But that’s just how it is when you’re keeping the system online, right?

interviewer: Have you experienced any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices, seeing things others don't, or having strong beliefs that others might find unusual?

patient: No. Just... static. My mind’s stuck in the 'on' position. You know how old radios pick up interference? It’s like that—just constant noise, but nothing specific. I guess I’m more... stuck in loops. Like calculating Mom’s bills over and over. But it’s not 'voices' or anything. Just... static. My partner says I mutter equations under my breath now. Maybe that’s what you mean? But it’s just... math, not thoughts. You know?

interviewer: I hear how the static in your mind feels constant. Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or vitamins, and if so, could you describe them?

patient: No medications, not officially. I mean... I’ve tried some over-the-counter sleep aids once, but they just made my head foggy. My partner left some B-complex vitamins on the counter last month—maybe I take one sometimes? Honestly, I can’t keep track. You know how it is... when you’re juggling parts lists and bills, you forget to restock your own damn shelves. I do drink a little more wine than I should at family dinners. But everyone does that, right? It’s just... stress.

interviewer: I hear how much you're managing physically and mentally. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain, that might be affecting your energy or mood?

patient: No, nothing official. Just... my mom’s back issues. I’ve got this tension in my neck, like a bolt that won’t loosen, but the doc says it’s ‘occupational.’ Sleep? I’ll take what I can get. You know how it is—everyone’s got something these days. Maybe I’m just... over-oiled.

interviewer: Let me recap what I’ve heard: You’ve been feeling overwhelmed by work responsibilities, caregiving for your mother, and financial strain for about eight months, leading to sleep disruption, physical tension, and difficulty focusing. This has affected your job performance and relationships, and you’ve been using alcohol to cope. Your history shows you’ve managed stress before with structured problem-solving, but now things feel more relentless. How does that align with your experience—what did I miss or get wrong?

patient: You’ve got the basics right—stress is the root, not some underlying condition. What you missed? My hands don’t just shake when I’m fixing a pipe. They twitch all the time, even when I’m trying to hold a coffee cup. And it’s not just sleepless nights… it’s like my body’s on a loop. I’ll lie there counting Mom’s pill bottles in my head, over and over, until the numbers blur. But yeah, you got the part about the ‘system overload’ right. Just… don’t forget the leak under the sink’s still there, even when I pretend it’s not.

interviewer: It sounds like the constant hand movements and repetitive counting are adding to your stress. What else did I miss that’s important to your experience?

patient: You didn’t mention how I take on extra freelance work to avoid feeling like a burden... but it just burns me out faster. And when I snap at my partner, I can’t stop replaying it in my head—like a stuck motor. It’s... there’s this leak under the sink I keep avoiding. It’s not just the physical stress. It’s the shame of knowing I’m drowning in it, but I can’t let anyone see the pipes are rusted through.

interviewer: It sounds like the shame you carry about your struggles feels like a hidden leak you’re afraid will burst into view. Let me summarize: Over the past eight months, you’ve been overwhelmed by work, caregiving, and financial stress, leading to physical tension, sleep issues, and strained relationships. You’ve taken on extra work to avoid feeling like a burden, but it’s burning you out, and you’re stuck replaying conflicts with your partner. The shame of feeling 'rusted through' adds to the pressure. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You’re close, but the shame’s not just a leak—it’s more like a pressure valve I can’t find. Yeah, the extra shifts help, but my hands... they’re always clenched, even when I’m trying to sleep. I’ll lie there, muscles tight like a coiled spring, counting Mom’s pills again. And when I snap at my partner, it’s not just replaying—it’s like a stuck gear. I fixate. But you’re right about the burnout. Last week, I forgot to water the chili plants. They’re all I have left that... grows. You know?

interviewer: It sounds like the chili plants are a small but meaningful anchor for you amidst the chaos. Let’s make sure we’ve captured everything: Your stress feels like a system stuck in overdrive, with physical tension, shame, and strained relationships as key symptoms. You’ve managed stress before through structured problem-solving, but now it’s more relentless. What else is important to include before we discuss next steps?

patient: The plants... they’re all I have that feels like fixing something real. But I forget to water them when the static gets loud. My hands tremble worse now—like a motor misfiring. And sleep? It’s just... white noise. I count pills, numbers, anything to stop the loop. But you’re right about the pressure valve. It’s not just shame—it’s fear the whole system’ll collapse if I let go. Even for a minute.

interviewer: It sounds like the fear of the system collapsing is a central part of your experience right now. What did I miss about how this pressure feels or how it shows up in your daily life?

patient: It’s like the circuit’s always live—no off switch. Even on days off, I’m tracking parts lists, bills... last month I took on freelance work ’cause the credit card balance was... getting out of hand. But then I lost my temper at my partner for being ’too positive’ and spent nights going over that argument. You ever try to fix a leak with your hands shaking? That’s my headspace. The chili plants? I forgot to water ’em twice this month. Guess I’m just... waiting for the whole system to crash.

interviewer: Let me try to piece this together: The stress feels like a system stuck in overdrive, with work deadlines, caregiving, and financial worries looping constantly. The physical tension and shame make it harder to slow down, and even small things like chili plants get neglected. It’s like you’re propping up a broken pipe while the pressure keeps rising. Does that capture what’s going on, or did I miss something key?

patient: Yeah, that’s... close. The pressure valve thing? Spot on. My hands still shake when I’m not even touching tools—try screwing in a lightbulb after a sleepless week. The credit card... it’s another leak I can’t quite reach. You ever feel like you’re patching one hole while the walls are sweating new ones? The plants are just... collateral damage. But the worst? It’s not even the crashing. It’s the waiting. Like I’m stuck in the ‘buffering’ screen before the crash. You know how that feels?

interviewer: It sounds like the credit card debt adds to the pressure and the fear of waiting for everything to collapse is a key part. What else have I missed that’s important to include before we discuss next steps?

patient: The shame of it, you know? The credit card... it’s not just a leak. It’s this silent hum in my head when I’m with her. I keep waiting for her to notice the numbers, to ask why I’m taking on so much work. But I can’t say it out loud. It’s like... my hands start twitching worse when I’m near the computer, like the cursor’s jumping around on its own. And the worst part? Even if I paid it off today, the valve’s still stuck. I’d just start sweating over something new.
