system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Craig. It sounds like things have been really heavy lately. Have you had a chance to review the information about today’s session, and do you feel comfortable proceeding?

patient: I guess... Yeah, I guess so. Just... been a rough season, you know? The weather's been against us. Can't even trust the sleep, what's the point in planning? Max keeps me going some days.

interviewer: It sounds like there’s a lot on your mind right now. Do you have any questions about how today’s session will work or what we might discuss?

patient: I guess... I just hope we don’t waste no time, you know? My mind’s been stuck in a drought longer than the fields. Max still waits for his walk, but I... I ain’t good at explainin’ things. Let’s just get to it.

interviewer: Can you tell me about what's been bringing you in today?

patient: I guess... it’s this feelin’ like the ground’s shifted out from under me. The fields, they’re a dead loss this season. Nights, I just... lie there, listenin’ to the wind howl like it’s mockin’ me. My partner, she tries to help, but I snap at her—don’t mean to. Max, he’s the only one who don’t ask questions. Just... sits there, steady. But I worry I’m a burden. Always have been.

interviewer: It sounds like the farm's struggles have added to your sense of being a burden. When did these feelings first start to really affect your daily life?

patient: I guess... it started when the crops didn’t take last spring. But it’s been slow, like a dry spell you don’t see comin’. The accident with the tractor... that’s when I knew I couldn’t hold it all together no more. I snap at her, but she don’t deserve it. Feels like the ground’s crumblin’ under me, but I can’t tell where to start fixin’ it.

interviewer: That sounds like a pivotal moment for you—can you tell me how the tractor accident specifically changed what you were experiencing?

patient: Well... that accident, it just added another crack in the foundation. I was already stretched thin with the drought, but wrecking that tractor felt like I was failing everyone—my partner, the land... hell, even Max deserves better. I can't even focus on fixing things; my hands shake when I try to work on it. They say it's stress, but... it's like the ground's still shifting beneath me.

interviewer: It sounds like the tractor accident and the farm struggles have really added to your sense of being overwhelmed... Have you experienced periods like this before, where you felt this down and hopeless?

patient: I guess... there was the time after the flood in '03. Lost half the crops, had to take on extra work. But this? Feels like the ground's dried up from the roots out. My hands used to hold up, now they shake when I try to fix nothin'. This ain't just hard times—it's like the weight's eatin' at me, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like this current struggle feels more consuming than past challenges... When the flood happened in '03, what helped you get through that period?

patient: Back then... I just kept putting one foot in front of the other. Focused on the next row, the next seed. Told myself the rain’d come eventually. But this time... the ground’s still shifting, and my legs feel like they’re made of sand. I keep waitin’ for the weight to settle... but it don’t.

interviewer: That sounds really tough, like the weight is becoming part of you... Have there been other times in your life when you felt this deeply down and hopeless, besides the flood in '03?

patient: I... I can’t recall nothin’ like this. There was the time after my dad passed, but that was different. You grieve, but this? This is like the ground’s turned to dust, and every step sinks deeper. My hands used to steady the plow, now they shake so bad I can’t even... (pauses, rubs palms together) ...hold a damn seed without droppin’ it.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry... How has your partner been supporting you through this difficult time?

patient: She... tries. Helps with the books, keeps the house up. But I guess when you’re used to pullin’ your weight, sittin’ idle feel like you’re lettin’ the whole field rot. We don’t argue much—just... quiet. She brings me coffee sometimes. Says Max and me need to keep movin’ so we don’t sink. (Rubbing palms on jeans) Truth is, I’m too quick to snap when she offers help. Feels like my own damn drought—no matter how much she pours in, it don’t stick.

interviewer: That sounds really tough. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life?

patient: Ain't... ain't nothin' like that. Just... bad luck, I guess. You keep diggin' in dry soil, eventually your hands give out. (Pauses, avoids eye contact.) But Max, she... she still needs walkin'. Can't let her down, I suppose.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight right now. Have you ever thought about what you would do if you wanted to end your life?

patient: Ain't... ain't gone there. Just thinkin' 'bout the land, how it needs rain. Max, she's got her own needs. Can't just leave her out there.

interviewer: I hear how much you care about Max and the land. Have you been using alcohol or cannabis to cope with the stress or sleep difficulties?

patient: Ain't... no. Not really. (Scratches Max’s head, avoiding eye contact.) Sometimes the nights get loud, but I figure the land needs quiet. A man can’t fix what he’s drinkin’ through, I guess.

interviewer: I hear that you’ve been managing without alcohol or cannabis. Have you used any other substances, such as prescription medications or stimulants, to cope with stress or sleep issues?

patient: Nope. Just... keepin' busy with Max. The nights are loud sometimes, but I figure the land needs quiet. Can't fix what you can't see, I guess.

interviewer: Have you been taking any medications or supplements, either prescribed or over-the-counter, to manage your symptoms or sleep difficulties?

patient: No, just... keepin’ busy with Max. Sometimes the nights feel like they’re diggin’ at me, but I reckon a man’s got to bear what he can. (Scratches Max’s ears, avoids eye contact.) Doctor gave me some pills once, but I couldn’t swallow ’em. Felt like they’d rust up the gears in my head.

interviewer: I understand that idea of something disrupting your mind’s rhythm is really concerning. Are you currently taking any other medications, supplements, or over-the-counter remedies for your symptoms or sleep difficulties?

patient: No... not really. I tried some sleeping pills once, but they left me feelin' off-kilter, like a tractor with a faulty carburetor. My body's got its own rhythm, I guess. Just... takes longer to kick in now.

interviewer: It sounds like your body’s rhythm is something you deeply respect. Have you noticed any periods recently where you felt unusually energetic or restless, even when you were tired?

patient: Restless? Maybe... but it’s more like a dry riverbed, y’know? Cracks where the water should be. I just... feel stuck in the dirt, not movin’ at all.

interviewer: I hear how that dry riverbed metaphor captures such a heavy feeling. Have you had any thoughts about how you might harm yourself if you decided to?

patient: No... Just... wishes the whole mess would end. Like a drought—prays for rain, but ain't pickin' the storm. My head's a dry riverbed, but I don't... plan nothin'. Just... tired. Real tired.

interviewer: I hear how exhausted you're feeling, like the weight of the drought. Have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts recently that feel concerning?

patient: No... just... always feelin' like folks are watchin'. Like the bank's got a bead on me, or the suppliers talkin' 'bout me behind my back. But it's probably just my mind playin' tricks, like the rest of this mess.

interviewer: It sounds like these thoughts about being watched are really distressing. Do these feelings come and go, or are they something that's been constant lately?

patient: It’s there most days, like a shadow that don’t lift... but it’s part of the dry spell, I guess. Feels like the ground’s still crackin’ under me. Can’t tell if it’s gettin’ better or worse. Just... constant as a drought.

interviewer: Let me recap what I’ve heard: Over the past year, you’ve felt increasingly overwhelmed by farm struggles, a recent tractor accident, and financial pressures, leading to hopelessness, sleepless nights, and strained relationships. Your energy and motivation have dropped, and you’ve been grappling with passive thoughts that life feels unmanageable, though you’ve held onto caring for Max as a reason to keep going. Does this capture your experience, or is there something key I’ve missed?

patient: I guess... yeah, that’s about right. You got the main bits. I mean, the sleepless nights, the farm, Max... but maybe you missed how it feels like the whole world’s watchin’ me fail. Like every cloud that rolls in is judgin’ me for lettin’ the land dry up. And the rage—sometimes I’m just a coiled spring, waitin’ to snap at the smallest thing. But it’s just this season, right? My partner says I’m carryin’ the weight of the whole farm in my shoulders. Maybe she’s not wrong.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight of the farm, the judgment you feel, and the simmering anger are really wearing on you. Let me recap: Over the past year, you’ve experienced persistent low mood, sleep disturbance, and irritability linked to farm struggles and a tractor accident. You’ve also described feeling watched or judged, with anger that feels close to the surface. Your partner supports you, but you feel like you’re carrying the farm’s burdens alone. Does this capture your experience, or is there something key I’ve missed?

patient: Yeah... that’s the gist. The judgment—it’s like the dry dirt, always there, crackin’ underfoot. I don’t know why I let it get under my skin so bad. The rage, though... it’s a live wire. One bad day, I snapped at Max for chewin’ a shoelace. She just looked at me like... like she understands. At least she’s got a belly to rub when the night gets too quiet. But the rest? It’s just this... weight. No rain, no relief. I guess it’ll pass. Some seasons do, right?

interviewer: It sounds like the dry dirt of judgment and the live wire of anger are part of this heavy season you're in, with Max being one of the few sources of relief. Before we look ahead, is there anything key I’ve missed about how these struggles started or what’s keeping them going?

patient: The accident... it’s like the crack where it all started. My old man always said if you can’t work, you’re dead weight. Now I’m stuck in that dry soil, can’t grow nothin’ but regrets. Max... she’s the only green shoot I got. But the rust in my head? That’s a drought I can’t break.

interviewer: It sounds like the tractor accident and your father’s message about worthiness have deepened this season of struggle, with Max being a rare source of life amid the drought in your mind. What did I miss about how these pieces fit together for you?

patient: I guess... the accident was the seed that grew the roots, but my old man’s words are the rot in 'em. Max? She’s the only leaf still green. But the weight of that dirt... it don’t lift, even when the sun comes out. Feels like I’m diggin’ a hole deeper every day.

interviewer: I appreciate your sharing these insights. What would you like to focus on next in our work together?

patient: I guess... I’d like to talk about what’s next for the farm. Not just the tractor or the debts, but how to keep the land from turnin’ to dust. Max and me, we walk that field every mornin’—maybe there’s somethin’ there, in the way she sniffs the soil, that’s worth... I don’t know, plannin’ around. And the sleep? Maybe we could figure out why the nights feel longer than the days these days.

interviewer: It sounds like the farm’s future, the emotional weight of its struggles, and the disrupted sleep are central to what’s feeling unmanageable right now. To make sure I’m understanding clearly, how would you say these pieces connect for you—especially between the land, Max, and the way the nights feel endless? What did I miss?

patient: The land... it's like it's givin' up, and I feel like I'm just... stuck watchin' it die. Nights, I can't sleep—mind racin' like a dry riverbed, thinkin' I've let everyone down. Max... she's the only thing that feels real. When I walk her, even if my legs feel like lead, she keeps me grounded. But the nights... they just keep comin', and I don't see no rain.

interviewer: It sounds like the farm’s decline mirrors the dry riverbed in your mind—both feel stagnant, judgmental, and impossible to refill. Max walks with you through the dust, but the nights stretch on without relief. What did I miss about how these pieces fit together for you?

patient: It’s... the way the land and me, we’re both stuck in this dry spell. I keep thinkin’ if I just push harder, maybe the rain’ll come. But Max... she don’t care ’bout the drought. She just needs me to take the walk, even when my legs feel like deadwood. What you’re missin’? Maybe... the debt. The accident. The way my dad’s voice still echoes in my head—*dead weight*. I don’t say it out loud, but it’s there. (Pauses, rubs his temples.) And the nights... they’re not just sleepless. They’re full of reckonin’. Of knowin’ I’m a mess, but not knowin’ how to fix it.

interviewer: It sounds like the tractor accident and your father’s message about worthiness created a foundation for this struggle, while ongoing debt, sleeplessness, and self-criticism keep the drought going. Max and your partner’s support are key sources of resilience. What did I miss about how these pieces fit together for you?

patient: The accident... it’s like the debt’s another root diggin’ deeper into that dry soil. My dad’s voice? It’s the wind howlin’ through the cracks, sayin’ I’m not worth the seed. Max... she don’t ask why I’m walkin’ slow. Just follows. But the nights... they’re not empty. They’re full of reckonin’. Of knowin’ I’m a mess, but not knowin’ how to fix it. (Pauses, rubs calloused palms together.) And the bills... they’re like that rust in my hands. Won’t wash off.

interviewer: It sounds like the tractor accident and your father’s legacy are roots in this drought, with debt and sleeplessness as ongoing storms, but Max walks with you through the dust. What did I miss about how these pieces shape your current struggles?

patient: I guess... the debt’s like a shadow I can’t shake. Even when I’m up walkin’ Max, I’m countin’ dollars in my head. My dad’s voice? It’s not just sayin’ I’m dead weight—it’s sayin’ I’m draggin’ folks down with me. (Pauses, rubs his temples.) And the nights... the sleeplessness ain’t just the mind racin’. It’s the guilt. Knowin’ every bill I can’t pay is another root chokin’ what’s left of the land.

interviewer: It sounds like the debt and your father’s voice are deepening the drought in your mind, with guilt over the land’s decline making the nights feel heavier. Before we look ahead, does this capture how these struggles started and what’s keeping them going, or is there something key I’ve missed?

patient: You’re close, but... there’s the weight in my bones. Like rust settlin’ in the joints, makin’ every step feel like draggin’ a plow through concrete. The nights? They’re not just guilt—they’re this... hollow ache, like the land’s takin’ every drop of strength I got left. Max walks steady, but I’m still countin’ those dollars in my head. (Pauses, rubs his calloused hand over his thigh.) The sleep’s gone, but it’s not just the mind racin’. It’s the feel of... bein’ worn down, like a tool they’re ready to chuck.

interviewer: It sounds like the physical weight you're carrying—like rust in your joints—and the emotional toll of debt and guilt are deepening this season of struggle, even as Max offers stability. Before we look ahead, is there something key I’ve missed about how these pieces connect for you?

patient: I guess... it’s the nights. The debt’s like a shadow that won’t lift, but the nights? They’re worse. Feels like my bones are fillin’ with sand—no rest, just this slow sinkin’. Max, she’s... steady. Walks like the earth ain’t shakin’ for her. But when she’s not here? The silence just digs. You ever try sleepin’ through a dry riverbed cracin’ in your head? It don’t let up. I don’t know. Maybe you got it. Maybe there’s no missin’ pieces.

interviewer: Let me weave this together: The tractor accident and your father’s legacy of worthiness planted seeds in this drought, with debt and sleepless nights acting like storms that keep the ground cracked. Max walks steady through the dust, offering a rare patch of green, while your body feels the weight of rust and sand. What did I miss about how these pieces shape your journey? And if there’s anything I’ve misunderstood, let me know—then we can look ahead to steps that might help the soil hold more water.

patient: You got the roots, I guess... but the real rot’s in the silence. The nights, they’re not just sand in my bones—it’s the guilt. The partner’s look when I snap... it’s like another drought. Max... she don’t judge. But I worry I’ll drag her down too. You think... maybe there’s a way to drain the soil enough to plant new things?

interviewer: It sounds like the silence and guilt at night are deepening the drought, while Max’s unwavering presence offers a rare patch of stability. Before we look ahead, is there anything key I’ve missed about how these threads connect for you—especially the hope of planting new things despite the weight you’re carrying?

patient: I guess... it’s the silence. The guilt don’t just sit there—it digs, like roots tearin’ at dry soil. Max, she... she’s the only thing that feels green in all this dust. But hope? It’s like plantin’ seeds in cracked ground. You think maybe rain’ll come, but what if it just washes what little green there is right out? I don’t know how to hold onto it without losin’ more.

interviewer: Let me weave this together: The tractor accident and your father’s voice planted roots in this drought, with debt and guilt deepening the cracks, especially in the silence of the nights. Max walks through the dust as your rare green shoot, and hope feels like risky seeds in cracked ground. What did I miss about how these pieces shape your journey?

patient: I guess... the movies. Late-night Westerns. They don’t fix nothin’, but... the old cowboys, they keep goin’ even when the ground’s fallin’ apart. Feels like I’m watchin’ someone else’s story. You think... maybe that’s the green shoot? Or just me starin’ at dust through a cracked screen.

interviewer: It sounds like the Westerns might be a flicker of resilience for you, even if it feels distant—like watching courage from another story. Before we look ahead, let me check: Did I miss any key pieces about how these themes connect for you, or how we might start draining that cracked ground together?

patient: I guess... the cowboys in those movies, they keep ridin’ through dust storms. Don’t stop. Even when their horses are skinnin’ down. Feels like I’m watchin’ someone else’s spines stay straight. Max... she don’t ask me to be brave. Just walks. Maybe that’s the start—walkin’ through the dust, one paw at a time. But what if the rain never comes? What if I’m just... diggin’ holes in the same dry ground?

interviewer: Before we wrap up, let me confirm our next steps: We’ll schedule a follow-up in two weeks to check in on your sleep and energy with Max. Does that work for you?

patient: I guess two weeks is as good a time as any... if the ground don’t crack too deep before then. Max... she’s the only reason I’m still walkin’ some days. I’ll be here, but don’t expect much rain in my head by then.

interviewer: It sounds like Max is a real source of strength for you. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up today?

patient: Nah... the land’s still dry, and the nights... they’re long. But I’ll be here in two weeks. Just... don’t expect me to bloom overnight.
