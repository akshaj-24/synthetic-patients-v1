system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that—I can see how overwhelming this has been for you. Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'things would be better if I just disappeared'?

patient: It’s not like I want to vanish. It’s more... if I wasn’t in the way, maybe things would just... function better. Like my brain’s a Wi-Fi signal that’s buffering all the time. I can’t even finish a patient chart without second-guessing everything. And my partner—God, they’re stuck trying to catch me when I freeze up. I just... I don’t want to be the thing that makes their life harder.

interviewer: That sounds really tough, Mariah. Would you be comfortable continuing with this interview today?

patient: I... I’ll try. But honestly, it’s like asking a broken clock if it wants to keep ticking. My brain’s already running on fumes, but if I don’t... if I don’t show up for these things, I guess I just keep proving to myself that I’m not even worth the effort. My partner keeps saying I’m not a burden, but they don’t see how much weight I’m carrying. Or maybe they do, and they’re just lying to be kind.

interviewer: Can you tell me more about what's been most troubling for you lately and how it's been affecting your daily life?

patient: The hardest part is... I keep catching myself second-guessing everything at work. Like, I’ll review a lab result three times just to be sure I’m not missing something. I know it’s not efficient, but what if I make another mistake? Last week, I couldn’t remember if I’d signed off on a patient’s chart by 3 a.m. or just stared at it. My mornings feel like... like I’m wading through cement. I used to love baking on Sundays, but now it’s just another box to check. I tell myself it’s temporary, but what if it’s not?

interviewer: It sounds like these feelings have been building up and starting to take a toll. When did you first notice these changes beginning, and how have they evolved over time?

patient: It’s hard to pinpoint the start—it crept in like a slow leak. I remember sleepless nights staring at charts, using work to avoid... whatever was missing. Then the fatigue set in, like wading through cement every morning. Last year, I messed up a lab result—a cancer delay. That’s when I realized it wasn’t just tired. Now? I’m just... waiting for the next thing to fall apart. My brain’s a Wi-Fi signal that buffers forever.

interviewer: It sounds like the error at work was a turning point for you. What are you hoping to achieve through this process, or what changes would you like to see in your life?

patient: Honestly? I’m not sure what ‘fixing’ looks like anymore. I guess I just want to… stop malfunctioning. You know, actually show up for my partner instead of being a ghost in my own life. And maybe stop spilling coffee on myself—would that even count as a win? I keep thinking if I could just… recharge, whatever that means, I’d be less of a liability. But I’m terrified the battery’s permanently dead.

interviewer: It sounds like the uncertainty about 'recharging' is really weighing on you... Can you share more about how your symptoms have changed since you first noticed them?

patient: It’s like... the fog used to be just in the mornings, but now it lingers all day. I used to stay up late looking at patient charts to avoid... other thoughts. Now I wake at 3 a.m. staring at my phone, rehearsing apologies to my partner. The fatigue’s worse—brushing my teeth feels like physical therapy sometimes. And the sourdough? It’s still ‘therapeutic,’ but I can taste the effort missing. Like I’m following the recipe but skipping the *why*.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry every day... Can you think of any specific changes or events that might have contributed to the worsening of these symptoms over the past few months?

patient: Honestly? I think my sister having a baby made everything sharper. Like, I joked about not even having time for a goldfish, but... it’s more than that. I hate that I resent it, but it feels like another reminder that I’m failing at... everything. Even wanting to fade into the background doesn’t feel like a joke anymore. It’s just... quiet, like that’s my new default setting.

interviewer: It sounds like this is a really challenging time for you. Have you experienced episodes like this before?

patient: Not exactly... I’ve had rough patches, sure. Burnout, maybe? But this feels different. Like the old ones were... static noise, and this is a full snowstorm. I can’t even tell which way is up. I keep waiting for it to pass, but it’s just... heavier this time.

interviewer: This sounds like a significant shift from what you’ve experienced before. Can you tell me more about those rough patches you mentioned earlier? What were they like, and what helped you manage them at the time?

patient: Burnout was... manageable. I’d power through with 4am coffee and convince myself I was ‘efficient.’ If I crashed, I’d take a 10-minute nap in my car between shifts. But this? It’s like my body’s rerouted all my energy to survival mode—basic functions, nothing extra. Even the caffeine’s just... wet cardboard. Last year, when my sister got pregnant, I told myself I’d ‘adjust’ like I do with schedules. But this isn’t a calendar update. It’s more like... my brain’s firewall got hacked, and now everything’s just buffering.

interviewer: I'm wondering if there's been any significant trauma or adversity in your life that might be connected to this current situation? For example, experiences that feel similar or have shaped how you cope with stress?

patient: I guess... my mom always said 'you’re only as good as your next achievement.' It’s hard to untangle that from everything else. The lab mistake last year? That’s fresh. I still wake up thinking about it. And my sister’s baby—don’t get me wrong, it’s lovely for her, but it’s like my brain keeps playing this loop of 'you’re falling behind' or whatever. I’m not great at parsing old from new stressors, though. My head feels like buffering Wi-Fi.

interviewer: It sounds like your mother's message has left a lasting impact on how you measure your worth. How do you think this belief interacts with the stressors you're facing now—like the lab mistake or your sister's baby—when you're already feeling overwhelmed?

patient: It’s like... my mom’s voice is the default settings on my brain. Now, when I mess up at work or feel left out watching my sister’s life bloom, I can’t tell if it’s her old programming or my current system errors talking. The lab mistake? It’s not just that I failed a patient—it’s that it ‘proved’ I’m decaying, like a machine losing calibration. But I’d rather fix IV lines all night than admit I need maintenance myself.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy internal conflict to navigate. Can you share how this sense of 'programming' affects your interactions with your partner or colleagues when you're feeling overwhelmed?

patient: At work, I hyper-focus on tasks to avoid... gaps. But I catch myself avoiding eye contact, like colleagues might see the 'fractured code.' With my partner, I get emotionally absent—rehearsing apologies at 3 a.m., but by morning, I’m too drained to even make coffee without spilling it. It’s like my systems are out of sync, but I’d rather let IV lines fall apart than admit I need troubleshooting.

interviewer: I'm really sorry you're feeling that way. Have you thought about any specific plans or ways to make things stop?

patient: I guess I just... let the days blur into routines. Like if I focus on the small things—work, coffee, the sourdough—maybe the rest will... quiet down. But I don’t think about 'plans.' It’s more like my brain’s on a loop of 'just get through this.' Even the bad days feel like they’re part of the same... static. I’d rather troubleshoot the IV lines than admit the system’s crashing.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight right now. Have you had any specific thoughts about how you might make things stop, even if just in your mind?

patient: Honestly? I just... imagine the noise quieting down. Like turning off a radio that's stuck on static. But I don’t have a manual for how to unplug it. I keep thinking maybe if I fix the IV lines first, the rest will follow. It’s... not a plan exactly. More like hoping the system updates itself eventually.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging. When you imagine the noise quieting down, do you see yourself no longer being around as part of that?

patient: I guess... if the noise stops, maybe my system just powers down. (Pauses, avoids eye contact) But that’s not the same as wanting it. It’s more like... I’m stuck in a loop, and the only escape is hitting 'delete' on the whole file. (Soft, bitter laugh) Though I’d probably mess that up too—like that lab result last year. Should’ve been a simple fix, but I botched it. Now everyone’s just waiting for the next error message.

interviewer: Have you thought about any specific ways or methods to make the noise stop?

patient: I’ve... I guess I imagine just... not being here anymore. (Short, shaky breath) But I don’t plan it. It’s more like... hoping the noise fades. Like a bad Wi-Fi signal just drops out. (Avoids eye contact, fidgets with hands) Though I’d probably botch even that—like the lab result. (Soft, bitter laugh) But I’m not even sure why I’m saying this. It’s not like it’s helpful.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional load. Are there any supports or reasons that help you keep going, even if things feel overwhelming right now?

patient: The sourdough... it’s therapeutic, I guess. Measurable. And Frasier reruns—predictable laughter helps, I suppose. (Pauses, avoids eye contact) My partner... they’re trying. But adulting’s a full-time job, and I’m not getting paid enough to do mine and theirs. (Bitter laugh) Work keeps me busy enough that I don’t have to... dwell. Most days.

interviewer: I want to make sure I understand your current situation fully. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use over the past few months?

patient: I don’t really track that stuff. Maybe a glass of wine sometimes? It’s not like I’m... you know. It’s just... adulting, right? (Avoids eye contact, shrugs) But I’d probably mess that up too—like the lab result. (Soft, bitter laugh)

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty. Have you used cannabis or any other substances in the past few months, even occasionally?

patient: Not really. Maybe a joint here and there? But it’s not like I’m... you know. It’s just... adulting. (Avoids eye contact, shrugs) Again, probably botch even that—like the lab result. (Bitter laugh, fiddles with hands)

interviewer: I want to understand more about your cannabis use. How often have you been using it in the past few months?

patient: It’s... not a weekly thing. Maybe once in a while, if I’m up at 3 a.m. staring at lab results and my brain feels like it’s rebooting in the middle of a storm. My partner says it’s a 'band-aid on a broken arm,' but honestly, it’s less addictive than my coffee habit. I just... need the static to quiet down sometimes.

interviewer: I hear how you're using it as a way to manage the noise. Have you used any other substances, like stimulants or opioids, in the past few months?

patient: No. Just... coffee. My partner says it’s a crutch, but honestly, it’s less addictive than my coffee habit. I just need the static to quiet down sometimes. Though, to be fair, I’m not sure where the line is between ‘functional’ and ‘lying to myself’ anymore. (Fidgets with sleeves, voice drops) The caffeine keeps me upright, but it’s like pouring water on a fire and hoping it evaporates instead of spreading.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including things like antidepressants, sleep aids, or over-the-counter pills?

patient: No medications—just coffee and... the occasional cannabis. My multivitamin’s expired, honestly. (Voice drops, fingers tap knee restlessly) The caffeine’s my... circadian regulator. Without it, I’d probably sleep until noon and then crash at 5 p.m. Again.

interviewer: I want to understand more about your health. Have you ever been diagnosed with a thyroid condition, sleep disorder like apnea, or chronic pain that might be affecting your energy levels or sleep patterns?

patient: No, nothing officially diagnosed. My doctor’s been more concerned about my caffeine intake than my thyroid. (Short laugh, fingers tapping knee) I guess if I had apnea, my partner would’ve filed for divorce by now—too many 3 a.m. arguments about ‘just one more cup’ vs. ‘you’re a human espresso machine.’ The fatigue? That’s just my battery life, I think. It’s not a disorder, it’s a… poor wiring job.

interviewer: I hear how you're making light of the situation despite feeling overwhelmed. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic, need very little sleep, or take risks that feel out of character for you?

patient: No. Just... caffeine surges. My partner says I’m a ‘human espresso machine’ on rare days. But that’s not energy—it’s just… noise. (Short, strained laugh) My brain’s not ‘upgrading’ or anything. It’s more like… a flickering bulb. You either get a flash or nothing. I don’t trust my own wiring anymore.

interviewer: Mariah, from what you’ve shared, it sounds like these feelings of overwhelm, cognitive fog, and emotional distance started gradually but have intensified over time, especially after the lab error and your sister’s pregnancy. They’ve affected your work, relationships, and basic self-care, and you’ve been carrying a lot of guilt and self-criticism. While there’s some passive thinking about disappearing, you haven’t mentioned a specific plan or intent. What did I miss?

patient: I guess you missed that my marriage feels like a two-income household where I’m the only one paying taxes. And the weed—I smoke it like it’s a Band-Aid on a broken arm. Holds the cracks for a hour, then I’m just... leaking again.

interviewer: What would be the most important next step for you in addressing these challenges?

patient: The most important step? Probably figuring out how to stop letting my brain short-circuit before I burn out completely. But I’m not sure where to start—my troubleshooting manual’s in the same drawer as my motivation. Maybe if I could just... stop leaking energy on things I can’t fix.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling stuck in a cycle of self-criticism and burnout, trying to hold things together while everything feels like it's leaking energy. What did I miss about how this cycle started or what keeps it going for you?

patient: I guess the firewall got hacked when my mom’s voice started playing on loop in my head—‘next achievement’ turned into a broken record. Every misstep feels like a data breach. And my sister’s baby? It’s a reminder that even good things bypass me. The weed just mutes the static for an hour, but the playlist’s still on repeat.

interviewer: It sounds like the cycle began with your mother’s achievement-driven messaging, intensified by the lab error and your sister’s pregnancy, and is now fueled by self-criticism and emotional avoidance. Protective factors include your partner’s support and your decision to seek help. What did I miss about how these pieces fit together for you?

patient: I guess what’s missing is how all this... it’s like my body’s on maintenance mode. Every ache or hiccup feels like a warning sign I can’t ignore. The lab thing wasn’t just a mistake—it was my body saying, ‘You’re overworked and broken.’ And my sister’s baby? It’s like a reminder that I’m not just behind, I’m... defective. The weed? It’s a temporary patch, but the system’s still crashing. I just... I don’t know how to fix what I can’t even see.

interviewer: It’s important we address that. When those warning signs show up, what are a few things you usually do to feel even a little bit better, even if just for a moment?

patient: I guess I smoke a little weed to mute the static, then try to catch up on sleep—even though my brain still feels like a reboot that didn’t take. I’ll bake a loaf or binge an old Frasier episode... anything with a predictable outcome, I guess. It’s not a fix, but it’s a... temporary patch until the system crashes again.

interviewer: It sounds like these strategies help you manage in moments, even if they don’t resolve the underlying exhaustion. If things feel unmanageable again between now and our next step, who could you reach out to for support?

patient: My partner, I guess. They’ve been... patient. But I avoid calling them most days because I don’t want to be that ‘broken appliance’ they have to troubleshoot. Sometimes I text my nurse at work—just about shifts or charts, nothing personal. It’s safer to be a problem they can fix with a checklist than... whatever I am off the clock.

interviewer: It sounds like maintaining boundaries to protect others from your struggles is a heavy burden you carry. If things feel unmanageable in the coming weeks, who else could you reach out to—professionally or personally—that might help you avoid feeling like a 'system error'?

patient: Honestly? I’m not sure. Maybe the hospital’s EAP? But I’d probably spend an hour Googling if it’s even real before picking up the phone. It’s easier to fix a leaky faucet than... whatever this is. I’m just not built for 'emotional maintenance' requests.

interviewer: It’s brave to acknowledge how hard it is to reach out, especially when you’re used to fixing things yourself. Let’s make sure we have a clear plan for next steps—would you be open to me outlining a few options for support, like connecting with the EAP or scheduling our next session, before we wrap up today?

patient: I… I guess I could look at those options. But I’ll probably overcomplicate it, like checking if the EAP even exists before it’s too late. If I schedule another session, does that count as… maintenance? Like, fixing a typo in the code instead of rewriting the whole program? I don’t want to just… buffer until the next crisis. But I’ll think about it. Maybe.

interviewer: It takes courage to consider these steps when it feels so overwhelming. Let's outline a concrete next step for you—would you like to schedule our next session or reach out to the EAP this week?

patient: I’ll… schedule the next session. It’s not like I have a ‘backup server’ to download this into anyway. But I’ll probably spend the next week second-guessing if it’s just… delaying the crash. And I’ll… maybe look up the EAP again. But if it’s not listed in three different places online, I’ll assume it’s a ghost network.

interviewer: It takes courage to take that step. Let’s make sure we have a clear plan—what are some warning signs that things might be getting worse for you between now and our next session?

patient: If I start waking up at 3 a.m. again, or if I can’t even... spill my coffee without spilling it. And if I reach for the weed before noon. That’s not normal for me. Also, if I start double-checking lab results three times just to feel like I’m not one typo away from catastrophe. I’ll probably ignore it until the Wi-Fi buffering thing turns into a full system crash, though.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Let’s make sure we have a clear next step—have you scheduled our next session yet, and would you like me to send a reminder or confirm the details for you?

patient: I scheduled it for two weeks out… I think. My calendar’s a bit of a maze these days. If you could send a reminder, that’d help—I’m not great at keeping up with my own schedule lately. Probably just my brain’s way of avoiding work, though.

interviewer: It takes courage to schedule that step in the midst of so much uncertainty. Let’s confirm the date and time for our next session—would you like me to set that now and send the reminder? Also, is there anything else you’d like to address before we close today?

patient: Yeah, let’s lock in the reminder. Tuesdays at 10 still work—I guess my calendar hasn’t deleted itself yet. As for anything else… I’ve been staring at that coffee mug on my desk for three days. It’s like my brain’s trying to send a memo, but the printer’s jammed. Maybe next week.
