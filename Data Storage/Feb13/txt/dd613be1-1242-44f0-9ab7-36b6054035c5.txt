system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Would you prefer I use any specific pronouns when referring to you today, Emma?

patient: Um... she. Just... she is fine. I guess. Doesn't really matter to me either way.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Would you like me to explain what today’s session will involve?

patient: I guess we can just... talk. I'm here, so. I mean, whatever you think we need to cover. I've been feeling really tired lately, but I don't know if that's important.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty. To help us make the most of our time together, would you like a brief explanation of how these sessions usually work?

patient: I guess it’s up to you. I just... want to get through this. Whatever way works. I don’t really know what to expect, but I’m here, so...

interviewer: Thank you for being here, Emma. Would you like to proceed with our session today?

patient: Yeah... sure. Let’s get started. I just hope we don’t have to talk too long, though. My brain feels like it’s running on battery power these days, you know? But I’ll try to keep up.

interviewer: That sounds really draining. Does that align with what you understand about today’s session?

patient: Yeah, it does. I guess I’ve just been... running on fumes lately. Not the kind that’ll ever refill, you know?

interviewer: That sounds really exhausting. Before we begin, is there anything specific you'd like to ask about today's session?

patient: I guess... I just want to make sure we stay on track. I’ve been trying to keep things organized lately, like aligning my pill bottles by color. It’s the little things that... help me not feel lost, I guess. Other than that, I’ll follow your lead.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying a lot of weight lately. Can you describe what’s been most difficult for you in your own words?

patient: It’s... hard to pinpoint, but the constant tiredness. Like, even getting through the day feels like wading through thick water. I used to love sewing, making those dresses—it was my escape. Now, the scissors just sit there, and I can’t even bring myself to touch them. I guess keeping the pill bottles aligned by color is one of the few things that feels... manageable. Other than that, it’s just trying not to let the weight press too hard.

interviewer: It sounds like the fatigue and loss of interest in activities like sewing are really affecting your daily life. When did you first start noticing these changes?

patient: It’s been... maybe a couple of years? Since the job ended, things just... slowed down. The sewing, the energy—it all faded. I guess I told myself it was just part of getting older.

interviewer: It sounds like this has been a gradual decline since the end of your job. Have there been any specific changes or events in the past couple of years that might have influenced how you're feeling now?

patient: I guess... my brother’s financial troubles added to it. He went under a while back, and I kept telling myself it wasn’t my problem. But it felt like another weight, you know? Like the world keeps piling things even when you’re already... stuck. Though I try not to dwell on it. My daughter’s postcard helps sometimes. She still thinks I’m her hero. It’s silly, but it’s one of the few things that... doesn’t feel heavy.

interviewer: It sounds like your daughter’s postcard is a meaningful anchor for you. What would you most hope to achieve through our time together today?

patient: I guess... I just want to feel like I can keep showing up, you know? Like, not being a burden to my husband or the kids. The postcard, it’s weird, but it feels like proof that I’m not totally... broken. I don’t know. Maybe I want to remember how to care about things again? Even if it’s small stuff, like... not hiding the half-eaten sandwiches in the drawer anymore.

interviewer: It sounds like this has been a really challenging time for you. Have you experienced episodes like this before, where you felt this down or hopeless?

patient: I guess... this is the first time it's felt this heavy. I've had my share of stress, you know? But lately, even small things feel like climbing a hill. Maybe it's just... everything piling up?

interviewer: It sounds like this weight is really new and different for you... Have you experienced anything like this before, where you felt overwhelmed by small tasks or lost interest in activities you used to enjoy?

patient: Not really, no. I mean, life’s had its ups and downs, but this... this feels different. Like, the sewing used to be my thing, you know? Now it’s just... there’s no ‘thing’ left. I guess I just run out of steam for everything.

interviewer: It sounds like this is different from what you've experienced before... Have you ever had a time when you felt this completely drained of energy or interest in things you used to love?

patient: No... this is the first time it’s felt like this. Even when I was stressed before, I could still get things done. Now, even picking up the scissors feels like climbing a hill. I guess... I just didn’t realize how much it had all added up until there was nothing left.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry... Can you tell me about the specific stressors in your life that you feel have added up to this point?

patient: I guess... my brother’s stuff added to it. His business falling apart, the debts—everyone’s been stressed about it. But I just... I don’t know. I used to sew so much, you know? Now even picking up the scissors feels... I don’t know. Like I’m waiting for something to click back into place, but it’s not happening. And work... well, being unemployed isn’t helping, but I guess that’s just life right now.

interviewer: It sounds like your brother’s situation has added a lot of weight to what you're already carrying… Have you experienced any traumatic events or significant hardships in your life that you think might be contributing to how you're feeling now?

patient: I guess... my dad was really strict about work. Always made me feel like if I wasn't busy, I was failing. That's probably why sitting still feels like a problem. My brother's money issues? Yeah, that's been heavy. But it's more... the quiet stuff, you know? Like how I used to sew all the time, but now even holding the scissors feels like too much. I tell myself it's just burnout, but...

interviewer: It’s clear how much you carry for others, even when it’s hard to feel connected… Can you tell me about someone in your life who you feel is a source of support, even when it’s difficult to stay close?

patient: My husband... he’s tried to be patient. I don’t want to worry him, so I just say I’m ‘tired’ or ‘stressed.’ He keeps pushing me to talk, but I end up making excuses—like how I’m just ‘adjusting’ to not working. The truth is, I’m scared he’d see how... broken I feel. My daughter sends these little postcards sometimes. Her last one said, ‘You’re my hero.’ I keep it on the fridge. It’s silly, but it’s something I can hold onto, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of emotional weight right now. Have you had any thoughts about whether things would be better if you weren't here?

patient: I guess... sometimes I wonder if disappearing for a little while would make things easier. But I don’t know. My husband would just worry more, and the kids... they already think I’m ‘just tired.’ To be honest, most nights I can’t even sleep because my brain won’t shut off. But then I see that postcard from my daughter on the fridge, and I tell myself to keep going. It’s silly, but it’s all I’ve got right now.

interviewer: It sounds like you’re holding onto that postcard as a lifeline right now. Have you ever had thoughts about ending your life, rather than just disappearing or not being here anymore?

patient: I... I don’t know. I haven’t really thought about it like that. Some nights, when I’m staring at the ceiling and my brain won’t stop racing, it feels like the weight is just... too much. But then I see that postcard on the fridge and I remember my daughter still thinks I’m her hero. I guess I can’t let her down. Not yet.

interviewer: It’s clear that your daughter’s postcard gives you a sense of purpose. Can you tell me about any alcohol, cannabis, or other substance use in the past few months?

patient: Honestly? I haven’t really touched anything like that. My husband knows I used to drink a little back when I was working, but now I just... don’t want to add anything else to the list of things he’s worrying about. I guess I’ve been relying on tea instead—lots and lots of green tea. It’s the only thing that keeps me going sometimes. But I’m trying to stick to the pills the doctor prescribed, you know? Easier to explain the tiredness that way.

interviewer: Can you tell me the names of the pills your doctor prescribed for you? I want to make sure I understand what medications you're currently taking.

patient: They’re Zoloft and maybe... Sertraline? The doctor wrote them down, but I mostly remember them as the white pill and the blue one. I take them with tea in the morning to settle my stomach. They help me get through the day, I think. The labels say 'antidepressants,' but I try not to dwell on the names.

interviewer: It sounds like the medications are part of your daily routine. Have you noticed any times when you feel more energetic or need less sleep than usual?

patient: Not really... I mean, some days I can push through, but mostly I just try to stick to my routine. The tea helps me keep going, I think. I don’t like to dwell on how tired I still feel, you know? It’s easier to just... do what I have to do.

interviewer: It sounds like your energy levels have been consistently low lately. Have there been any times in the past where you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep, even when you were otherwise stressed or overwhelmed?

patient: I guess... when I was still working, I used to push through a lot. But that was just surviving, you know? Now, even getting through the day feels like climbing a hill. I don’t really remember feeling 'unusually' energetic—just... trying not to sink.

interviewer: It sounds like your thoughts and perceptions have been pretty consistent for you. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices, seeing things others don't, or believing things that seem unusual to others?

patient: No, nothing like that. I don’t hear voices or see things. My mind just... feels foggy sometimes, like trying to thread a needle when the light’s too dim. But I guess that’s just getting older, right? Or being over it all.

interviewer: Let me recap: You’ve described a gradual decline over the past two years, starting around your job loss, with persistent low mood, fatigue, and loss of interest in sewing and social activities. Stressors like your brother’s financial struggles and childhood work expectations seem to have played a role, while your husband’s support and your daughter’s postcard are key protective factors. We’ve also noted some passive thoughts about disappearing but no active plan. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... the postcard from my daughter still sits on my fridge. And sometimes I... stare at things, wondering if they’d notice if I just... vanished. But it’s easier to focus on the pills, the colors, you know? Keeps me from thinking too much.

interviewer: Let me make sure I’ve captured everything: You’ve shared how the postcard from your daughter is a small but meaningful connection, while the passive thoughts about disappearing feel like a heavy, ongoing struggle you manage by focusing on routine—like organizing pills by color. You also mentioned it’s easier to lose yourself in those details than face the overwhelm of bigger thoughts. What did I miss?

patient: I guess you didn’t miss much. It’s just… the stillness feels heavier than it should. Like, I used to think being busy meant something, but now even sitting still feels like I’m failing. My husband says I’m ‘resting,’ but I just… I don’t know. It’s not rest. It’s more like waiting for the next thing to go wrong. Oh, and I still can’t bring myself to talk about my brother’s mess. It feels like it’s my fault he’s in that situation, even though I know it’s not. But I guess that’s just me, always finding ways to feel like a burden.

interviewer: Let me try to capture what’s most pressing: You’ve described feeling trapped in a cycle where rest feels like failure, guilt over your brother’s struggles lingers unspoken, and the weight of stillness makes even small tasks feel like battles. The postcard from your daughter is a small light, but the rest feels like waiting for the next blow. Does that align with your experience, or is there something I’ve overlooked?

patient: Yeah, that’s... that’s pretty much it. The brother thing—it’s not even about the money, it’s just this knot in my chest, like I’m 14 again and waiting for my dad to yell about something I didn’t do. I guess I’m just used to carrying that weight. But the postcard... it’s stupid, right? It’s the only thing that feels real lately. I look at it and think, *Maybe she’s right*, even if it’s just for a second.

interviewer: It sounds like the postcard from your daughter and the unspoken guilt about your brother are two threads that carry a lot of weight for you. Before we think about next steps, is there anything else you’d like to add or adjust about how we’ve framed your experience today?

patient: No, that’s… that’s pretty much it. The postcard’s the only thing that feels like a real anchor. Everything else is just trying not to let the silence swallow me whole. I guess I’m waiting for the next thing to fall apart, but… I’ll keep threading those pill bottles, I suppose.
