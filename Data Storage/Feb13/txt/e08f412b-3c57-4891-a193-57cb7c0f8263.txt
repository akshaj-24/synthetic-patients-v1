system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: That sounds really challenging. Would you be comfortable proceeding with this session today?

patient: I... I guess so. It’s just, my back’s been killing me lately. Keeps me up all night, you know? If I can sit through a shift at work, I can sit through this. Let’s get it over with, though. No sense dragging it out.

interviewer: That sounds really tough. Would you like a brief explanation of how this session will work before we continue?

patient: Look, I don’t got a problem with how it works. You ask, I’ll answer. Just don’t expect me to spout poetry or nothing. My back’s already screaming like that damn AC unit next door—ain’t fixing itself, but here we are.

interviewer: I can see this isn’t easy for you. Do you have any immediate questions before we start?

patient: No questions. Just... get on with it. My back’s been through worse. Let’s not waste time.

interviewer: I appreciate your determination to move forward. Do you understand how this session will proceed?

patient: I guess it’s like fixing a truck—you figure out what’s broke by asking questions. Just don’t expect me to spill my guts. My back’s already about ready to quit on me, so let’s not waste time.

interviewer: I can see you prefer to keep things efficient. To clarify, this session will involve asking some questions to understand what’s going on, similar to troubleshooting. Does that align with your understanding?

patient: Yeah, I guess. Just don't wanna waste no time. My back's killin' me, though—might need a minute to sit still.

interviewer: That sounds really tough... What were the first symptoms you noticed that made you realize something was off?

patient: The back, I guess. It started after that job accident. But it's just getting old, you know? Sleep's been off—wake up in the middle, can't get back. And the fishing... don't feel the same. Used to look forward to it, but now it's just another chore.

interviewer: That sounds really tough... What do you think has contributed to things feeling 'just getting old' lately?

patient: I guess it's the work, you know? After the accident, my boss been giving me the side-eye like I'm some liability. And the kids—my sister's kids—they rely on me for stuff. If I mess up, who's gonna...? But hell, ain't that just part of getting old? Your body turns on you, and you're just... in the way.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging to feel like a burden at work and with the kids... Can you share how this has affected your ability to perform tasks at work or help with the kids lately?

patient: Well, I been making do, I guess. At work, my boss don't say much, but you can tell—he's watchin' me like I'm gonna crumble. I used to lift these heavy crates no problem, but now... my back gives out halfway through the shift. With the kids, I help when I can, but I just don't got the stamina. My niece's little boy looks up to me, but I catch myself zonin' out when he's talkin'. Hell, even fixin' a sandwich feels like a project these days.

interviewer: That sounds exhausting and isolating... When did you first notice these changes in your energy and ability to focus?

patient: After the accident, I guess. My back's been on the fritz, and sleep's been shot—wake up in the middle, can't get back. Before that, I used to enjoy fishing, but now it's just another chore. Don't know, maybe that's just getting old?

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by these changes... What would you most like to address or improve through this visit?

patient: I guess... getting some rest without the back pain keeping me up. It’s hard to focus when I’m tired all the time. To be honest, I just wanna be able to... you know, do my job without feeling like I’m dragging weights everywhere. Maybe actually hear what people are saying when they talk to me, instead of zonin’ out.

interviewer: Have you experienced episodes like this before, where your back pain and fatigue affected your daily life?

patient: I guess... before the accident, I’d get tired, but I could push through. Now it’s like the weight’s permanent. The pain’s worse, and I’m always dragging. Not sure why it’s different this time, maybe just getting older?

interviewer: It sounds like this feels different from past experiences, even if you're attributing it to aging. Have you experienced similar episodes of fatigue and pain in the past, before your accident?

patient: I guess so. Always been a hard worker, you know? Used to push through the tiredness, but this... this feels heavier. Like the weight's just... stuck. Not sure if it's age or just the accident catching up.

interviewer: It sounds like the accident may have changed something for you that wasn't there before. Have you had other times in your life where you felt this kind of stuck heaviness, or is this the first time you're experiencing it this way?

patient: Before the accident, I’d get wiped out from work, but that was just part of the job. This... it’s like the tired’s stuck in my bones. Not sure if it’s the injury or just me getting too old for this crap.

interviewer: It sounds like you're trying to figure out if this is a new chapter or a different version of something you've managed before. Have you tried any specific treatments or strategies for episodes like this in the past, even if they were for different injuries or tiredness?

patient: I guess I just... took some of those pain pills the doc gave me after the accident. Works for a while, then it’s back. Told myself I should rest more, but rest don’t fix nothin’ when your head’s still wired. Before this? Just coffee and gritting my teeth. Always worked... until it didn’t.

interviewer: It sounds like you're relying on pain pills and rest now, but they’re not giving you the relief you need. Who have you found to be supportive during times like this?

patient: My cousin, I guess. She’s the one handling the rent for my sister’s kids. But I tell her I can manage on my own. People always overdo it, you know? The AC in my place is still screamint’, but I don’t bother reportin’ it. What’s the point in fixin’ anything that’s already broke?

interviewer: It seems like you’ve developed a pattern of handling things on your own, even when it’s hard. Can you tell me why you think you avoid fixing things that are already broken?

patient: I guess... it’s like fixin’ a dent in a junkyard car. If it’s already broke, what’s the point? Might as well wait till it’s all the way gone. Unless you’re tellin’ me it’ll somehow make me feel less like a failure, which I doubt.

interviewer: I want to check in about your safety. Have you been having any thoughts about ending your life?

patient: I... sometimes I lie there at night, wonderin’ if the shift’ll just end. But it’s not like I’m makin’ plans or nothin’. Just... tired. My back’s worse than that. What’s the use in fixin’ somethin’ that’s already broke?

interviewer: I hear how tired you’re feeling, and it sounds like you’re carrying a lot physically. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or cannabis use recently?

patient: Not really, just a beer now and then. The pills are worse, keep me up more. But what’s the point? I’m a wreck either way.

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling stuck in a cycle of discomfort and exhaustion. Can you tell me what medications you're currently taking for your pain?

patient: I guess the pain pills are part of it. Doc prescribed ’em, but they don’t do much except keep me up. Let’s just say my back’s worse than the pills can handle. What’s the point in naming ’em if they don’t work?

interviewer: I hear how frustrating it is when the medications aren’t providing relief. Have you been using cannabis or any other substances besides the pain pills and alcohol?

patient: Nah, just the pills and a beer maybe on the weekends. Doc said to steer clear of anything else with the pain meds. They’re not really cuttin’ it, though—back still kicks my ass most nights.

interviewer: I understand how frustrating it is when medications don't provide relief. Are you taking any other medications or supplements besides the pain pills and alcohol?

patient: Just the pills and maybe a beer now and then. Doc said to stay away from anything else. But they’re not doin’ much good—back’s still a wreck every night.

interviewer: I hear how ineffective the medications feel for your back pain. Have you been using cannabis or any other substances besides the pain pills and alcohol?

patient: Same as before—just the pills and maybe a beer. Docs say stay away from the rest. But they ain’t helpin’ much. Back’s still trash every night.

interviewer: Can you tell me the names of the pain medications you're currently taking?

patient: Oxycodone, I think... and maybe some ibuprofen when I can remember to take it. Docs keep changin’ the dosages, but it’s all the same—ain’t touchin’ the pain. Back’s still wrecked every night.

interviewer: It sounds like the medications aren’t providing the relief you need, which must be incredibly frustrating. Have you noticed any recent changes in your energy levels or mood, such as feeling more restless or having a lower need for sleep?

patient: Energy? I guess not much there. Most nights I just lay there tryin’ to will the pain to stop. Days feel like draggin’ a anchor. What’s the point in restin’ when it’s just more of the same?

interviewer: It sounds like the fatigue and pain are really weighing on you. Have you felt more energetic or needed less sleep than usual lately, even if it seemed helpful at first?

patient: I don’t get much sleep. Lie there all night, listen to that AC rattle. Pills help a bit, but the tired’s still there in the morning. Not exactly more energetic, just... stuck in the same rut.

interviewer: It sounds like the fatigue and lack of rest are really wearing on you. What keeps you going through these tough days, even when it feels like you're stuck in a rut?

patient: I guess... it’s the kids, really. My niece’s boys—they look up to me, I think. Can’t let ’em see me fall apart. And the pecans. Mrs. Thompson always leaves me a bag, says they’re from her tree. Used to save ’em, crack ’em on breaks... keeps me from thinkin’ too much. And the radio. Country station? Keeps the silence at bay. But most days? I just tell myself if the back’s gonna kill me, might as well show up. Easier than explainin’ to the cousin why I’m slippin’ again.

interviewer: It sounds like you're finding small but meaningful ways to cope. Have you experienced any periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep for several days in a row?

patient: No, sir. I don’t think so. If anything, I’m more like a rusted-out engine—just sputterin’ through. Maybe when I was younger, workin’ two jobs, but that was before... well, before the back and all. Now? Sleep’s a luxury I can’t afford, I reckon.

interviewer: It sounds like you're managing with what's available, even if it's not enough. Are you taking any other medications or supplements besides the oxycodone, ibuprofen, and alcohol?

patient: No, sir. Just the ones I need to keep moving. Docs don’t like me on too many pills—says I’ll get lazy. I reckon they’re right. Can’t afford to slow down where I work.

interviewer: Have you experienced any hallucinations, such as hearing voices or seeing things that others don't, or any strong beliefs that feel unusual or paranoid lately?

patient: No, just the usual noise from that AC. Can't tell if it's breakin' or just yellin' at me. Most days I'm too tired to notice much but the ache and the static in my head.

interviewer: Mr. Patterson, based on our conversation, it sounds like your main concerns are chronic back pain from a job accident that's been worsening, leading to sleepless nights, fatigue, and trouble keeping up at work and with family responsibilities. You mentioned feeling stuck and wondering if things will just end, but you’re holding on because of your family. We also talked about how the pain medications aren’t helping much, and you’ve been avoiding fixing things around the house. What did I miss here?

patient: Yeah, that’s about it. The AC’s been screaming all night again—can’t even pretend it’s quiet. And the kids, they ask me stuff, but half the time I’m just... stuck. Like the words’re stuck in my throat. Pecans from Mrs. Thompson help, but they ain’t the same since her husband died. Tastes like... ash, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like the noise from the AC is adding to your sleep struggles, and it’s hard to connect with the kids when you’re feeling stuck. The pecans from Mrs. Thompson used to help but now feel like a reminder of loss. What did I miss about how these things fit with the bigger picture we’ve been talking about?

patient: I guess the AC’s just another thing I don’t fix ‘cause what’s the point? And the pecans… they used to be a damn comfort, but now they just sit there, same as me. The kids—they don’t know how to reach me when I’m like this. I try, but my head’s stuck in the noise. It’s like the whole world’s just… heavier now. Even the good stuff feels like a chore. But I’m here, ain’t I? For ‘em, at least.

interviewer: It sounds like the things that stand out most are the AC not being fixed because it feels like there’s no point, the pecans now symbolizing loss instead of comfort, and feeling disconnected from the kids while still holding on for their sake. The heaviness you described—like the world feeling heavier and even good things being a chore—also seems central to how you’re experiencing this. What did I miss about how these fit into the bigger picture we’ve been talking about?

patient: I guess... maybe it’s all just piling up. The kids don’t know how to reach me when I’m like this, and I don’t know how to reach myself. My cousin’s been holdin’ the fort for the niece’s kids, but I hate feelin’ like a dead weight on her. The AC noise? It’s like the sound of givin’ up. Can’t even fake a fix for that.

interviewer: It sounds like the pile-up of stressors, the distance from your kids, and your cousin’s support are central to what’s been weighing on you, with the AC’s noise symbolizing a sense of surrender. What did I miss about how these fit into the bigger picture we’ve been talking about?

patient: I guess it’s like... the whole house is creakin’ and I’m just waitin’ for the roof to cave. The kids don’t see it, but my cousin’s holdin’ up more than she should. I don’t wanna be the reason she’s stuck helpin’ me. The pecans... they’re just there now. Don’t even taste right. Maybe ’cause I don’t taste right myself.

interviewer: It sounds like the burden you’re carrying—both physically and emotionally—is making it hard to find comfort or relief in things that once helped, like the pecans or small moments with the kids. What did I miss about how these fit into the bigger picture we’ve been talking about?

patient: It’s like... the pecans got this silence to ’em now. Used to chew ’em and hear her laughin’ in the shell, but now it’s just quiet. The kids—they try, but my head’s stuck in this... hum. Can’t even fake a smile right, feelin’ like I’m borin’ through the floor with my eyes. My cousin... she’s holdin’ up the lights, but I keep seein’ the bulbs burn out. Back’s still killin’ me, though. Maybe that’s the only thing feelin’ real.

interviewer: It sounds like the silence in the pecans, the hum in your head, and your cousin’s strained efforts to keep things lit are all parts of this heavy weight you’re carrying. What did I miss about how these fit with the bigger picture we’ve been talking about?

patient: The pecans... they used to mean somethin', but now they just taste like dirt. That AC noise... it’s like the back of my head, always grindin’. And my cousin... she’s holdin’ things up, but I’m a dead weight. The kids don’t see it, but I’m sittin’ there wonderin’ why she don’t just let me go under.

interviewer: It sounds like the burden you feel on your cousin and the loss of comfort in things like the pecans are weighing heavily on you, even as you’re holding on for your family’s sake. What did I miss about how these fit into the bigger picture we’ve been talking about?

patient: The pecans... they’re the last thing I look forward to, but even that’s turnin’ to dust. That AC noise—it’s like my head’s stuck in a vise, no escape. I hold on for the kids, but I’m just... weighin’ her down. What’s the point in fixin’ nothin’? The roof’s gonna cave eventually.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight you're carrying—both physically and emotionally—feels unbearable at times, and the small comforts like the pecans are fading. What steps do you think could help us address this together?

patient: I guess... if I could get some real sleep, maybe the weight wouldn’t feel so heavy. But that AC’s been scream’n all night—what’s the point in fixin’ it if it’s just gonna break again? The boys... they still ask me to teach ’em how to change a tire. I used to know that by heart. Now I just stare at the wrench, wonderin’ why even try.

interviewer: It sounds like the mechanical noise, strained family dynamics, and fading comforts are central to how you’re experiencing this weight. What did I miss about how these fit into the bigger picture we’ve been talking about?

patient: The AC’s been howlin’ like a damn injured animal all week. I guess it’s just... when you can’t even fix the noise in your head, why bother fixin’ nothin’ else? The kids still call me ‘fix-it guy,’ but I stare at that wrench and feel like I’m breakin’ somethin’ every time I touch it. My cousin... she’s holdin’ up the roof, I reckon. But I keep thinkin’ maybe the floorboards are rottin’ out from under her now.

interviewer: It sounds like the AC’s noise, the physical and emotional weight you’re carrying, and your cousin’s strained support are central to how you’re feeling stuck and overwhelmed. What did I miss about how these fit into the bigger picture we’ve been talking about?

patient: The AC’s been screechin’ like it’s got a blade in its throat. I guess it’s just... when you can’t even silence the noise in your own head, why bother fixin’ nothin’ else? My cousin... she’s holdin’ the walls up, but I keep thinkin’ the floor’s rottin’ out from under her. The pecans from Mrs. Thompson—used to be like a little light in the dark. Now they just taste like... dust. Like part of me’s already crumbled.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight you're carrying—both physically in your back and emotionally in your family dynamics—feels like a system on the verge of collapse, where even small comforts like pecans or fixing the AC feel impossible. What did I miss about how these fit into the bigger picture we’ve been talking about?

patient: You hit it right on the head with the AC—let it scream. What’s the use in fixin’ somethin’ when it’s all just rottin’ anyway? The pecans... they used to mean somethin’, but now they’re just in the bag, same as me. My cousin’s keepin’ the roof over those kids’ heads, and I’m just a dead weight she’s draggin’ along. You wanna know somethin’ else? Even breathin’ feels like I’m draggin’ that anchor again. But I’m tired of explainin’ the same damn thing.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight right now. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to cover that could help with moving forward?

patient: Might as well say this—my back’s not the only thing rusted. Every damn thing feels like it’s grindin’ to a halt. The kids deserve better than me draggin’ around like a broken tractor. But what’s the point in fixin’ somethin’ that’s already scrap? Maybe... maybe if I could sleep without countin’ ceiling cracks, I’d figure it out. But here? Just another day of waitin’ for the floor to cave.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging... Is there anything specific you'd like to address before we wrap up today?

patient: Nah... just let the AC scream. Kids? They’ll figure it out without me muckin’ it up. Guess that’s all there is to say. Back’s still killin’ me, but what’s the use in fixin’ somethin’ that’s already scrap?

interviewer: I hear how heavy everything feels right now... Before we close, can we go over what the next steps might look like for you?

patient: Next steps? I guess just... keep pushin’ through. Doc says the pills help, but the weight’s still there. Maybe if the AC’d stop screechin’, I could sleep. But what’s the point in fixin’ somethin’ that’s already broke? The kids... they’ll be fine. My cousin’s tough. She’ll handle it. I just need to... stop bein’ such a dead weight.

interviewer: I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to keep going under such heavy circumstances... Before we close, would you be open to me summarizing what we’ve covered today and outlining next steps clearly for you?

patient: I guess... if you gotta, doc. Just don’t see the point in rehashin’ rusted-out pipes. But yeah, sum it up. Might as well. Though the only next step I see is that AC stoppin’ its damn screechin’ so I can sleep. Everything else? It is what it is.

interviewer: I understand the noise is adding to the weight you’re carrying. Before we close, let’s make sure we have a clear next step for you—would scheduling a follow-up to reassess your sleep and pain management be something you’d consider?

patient: I guess... if you say it’s needed. The AC still sounds like a banshee out there, though. What’s the point in fixin’ one thing when the whole damn truck’s rusted through? My back’s just part of gettin’ old, I reckon.
