system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Hi Curtis, thank you for coming in today. Just to start, is there anything about your name or pronouns you'd like me to know?

patient: Curtis Owens, no pronouns needed—I’m as straightforward as a science textbook, which my father would’ve approved of. He always said clarity was the enemy of confusion. Though I suppose ‘curt’ is a fitting adjective… if that’s the right term.

interviewer: Curtis, I appreciate your directness. Today’s session will involve discussing your concerns to understand what’s going on and how we can support you. Would you be comfortable proceeding with that?

patient: Proceeding sounds like a controlled experiment—I’ll play the lab coat volunteer. Just don’t ask me to hypothesize about my feelings; I’m better with data points than emotional variables. But yes, let’s… proceed.父親 would’ve liked the structure.

interviewer: Your structured approach makes sense. Do you have any initial questions about how we’ll proceed today?

patient: No questions—structure is my comfort zone. I’ll just note that I tend to... over-optimize for hypotheticals. Like when I rewrite a report seven times, just in case. It’s a Type-A mess thing. But if you need me to unlearn old habits, I’ll try. Though I might need a flowchart for that.

interviewer: Can you tell me about the main concerns that have been bringing you in for this appointment?

patient: It’s the... excessive what-ifs that won’t shut off. At work, I’ll hyper-focus on minor details—like recalculating numbers seven times—while forgetting to submit the actual report. Sleep? More like 3 a.m. brainstorming sessions about... everything. My daughter’s college loans don’t help. I keep wondering if I’m shortchanging her future. It’s just... mental double-checking, you know? My father would’ve called it 'due diligence,' but I’m starting to think it’s just my brain on infinite loop.

interviewer: It sounds like these patterns have been really disruptive to your work and sleep. When did you first notice this started becoming a pattern for you?

patient: It’s hard to pinpoint the exact start, but I’d say... it’s been creeping up for years, really. My father was a high-achiever who equated productivity with self-worth, so I guess I absorbed that. To be honest, I used to think it was just... discipline. But now? Rewriting reports seven times or lying awake at night parsing ‘what-ifs’ feels less like control and more like a glitch. Irrational, but there it is.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying this pattern for a long time, shaped by expectations that may no longer serve you. What would you most like to achieve through this therapy process?

patient: I suppose... I want to stop the hamster wheel from spinning when there’s no cage door to open. If I could ‘optimize’ how I process worries—like, actually sleep through them instead of simulating solutions at 2 a.m.—that would help. But honestly, the bigger goal is not passing this same... rigidity to my daughter. She deserves a parent who stops at ‘due diligence’ and doesn’t confuse it with panic. Without sounding like a broken record, of course.

interviewer: That sounds like a meaningful priority for you. You mentioned these patterns have been creeping up for years—what specific changes in the past few months made you decide to seek help now?

patient: The breaking point was when I missed a deadline at work—something I’d never done before—and it triggered a cascade of second-guessing that lasted weeks. I kept thinking, 'If I can’t even stay on task for myself, how am I modeling stability for my daughter?' It’s... it sounds overdramatic, but seeing her thrive in her new role made the gap between who I am and who I want to be impossible to ignore. Plus, I caught myself reaching for the whiskey earlier in the evening lately. 'Responsible adulting,' right? My daughter would laugh at that, but... it’s not sustainable.

interviewer: It sounds like reaching for the whiskey has become a way to cope with this overwhelming cycle. How has that been working for you—has it provided relief, or does it add to the stress?

patient: It’s a bit of a paradox, honestly. The whiskey does... quiet the noise for an hour. But then there’s this lingering guilt, like I’m rewarding avoidance instead of problem-solving. It sounds irrational, but I worry it’s teaching my daughter that ‘managing stress’ means numbing it, not addressing it. I’m not exactly a poster child for sobriety, but... if I could trade that hour of quiet for a hour of actual rest, I’d take it in a heartbeat.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to maintain control is taking a significant toll on your energy and focus. Have you experienced similar patterns of stress or perfectionism in the past that disrupted your work or personal life, and if so, what strategies helped you manage it back then?

patient: I suppose... in the past, I just buried myself deeper in work. If a project felt shaky, I’d double-check every decimal point until it was ‘perfect.’ Sounds irrational, but it was my way of... silencing the noise. Honestly, it worked for years. But now? My spreadsheets aren’t balancing, and my herb garden—thyme for patience, get it?—feels like the only thing I can actually *focus* on. It’s ridiculous, but even that’s a fragile distraction.

interviewer: It’s meaningful that the herb garden offers even a small sense of focus for you right now. How has this approach compared to the strategies you used in the past—like hyper-focusing on work—to manage stress, and what do you think makes it feel different?

patient: The garden... it’s different because it’s not about ‘due diligence’ or proving I can still be reliable. When I hyper-focused on work, it was like I had to outrun some invisible deadline set by my father’s expectations. Now, it’s just... basil and thyme. If I overwater them, they’ll die, but it’s not like the world ends. I joke about ‘thyme for patience’ to sound reasonable, but honestly? It’s the only thing where I don’t immediately start calculating worst-case scenarios. Though I still check the soil moisture three times a day. Old habits, you know?

interviewer: It’s interesting how the garden allows you to engage without the weight of expectations. Can you share how your father’s emphasis on structure and achievement might have shaped your current patterns of managing stress and self-worth?

patient: My father’s world was all about precision and output—every achievement had to be measurable. I think I’ve carried that need to ‘optimize’ everything, even when it’s counterproductive, like... triple-checking soil moisture instead of just watering the plants. It’s ironic, right? The garden’s supposed to be low-stakes, but I still treat it like a lab report. I guess the difference now is that I’m starting to realize some things don’t need a ‘correct’ answer. Though I’ll probably still overprune the basil. Old habits, as they say.

interviewer: It’s clear how deeply embedded these patterns are, especially given their roots in your upbringing. Have you noticed similar cycles of stress and overcompensation in other major life transitions, like your divorce or your daughter’s career milestones, and if so, how did you navigate them back then?

patient: The divorce... well, it felt like another 'project' to manage. I threw myself into work to avoid the... the mess of emotions, like if I stayed late enough, I could outpace the guilt. With my daughter’s promotion, it’s bittersweet. I’m proud, but my brain keeps running calculations—what if I didn’t prepare her enough financially? Now, I try to let small things be, like the garden. If the basil gets leggy, it’s not a failure, just... pruning. But honestly? I still check the soil moisture at 2 a.m. Some habits are harder to uproot than others.

interviewer: It’s significant how your father’s expectations continue to shape your approach to stress, even in spaces meant to feel low-stakes. Have there been other times when these stress patterns led to similar challenges in your life, and if so, what strategies or support systems helped you navigate those periods?

patient: There was that time I rewrote a report seven times—what if I missed a decimal point?—then forgot to submit it. I buried it with work hours and a glass of whiskey, telling myself it was 'due diligence.' Now, the garden forces me to... let go. If the basil wilts, I just prune. Though I still check the soil at 2 a.m. Some roots run deeper than others. It’s ironic, right? My father’s 'precision' lives on in my overwatering.

interviewer: It’s striking how the whiskey becomes both a coping tool and a source of guilt for you. How has this evening ritual with alcohol shaped your ability to manage stress or sleep, and what alternatives have you considered to replace it?

patient: It’s a bit of a paradox, really. The whiskey does... quiet the 1,000 what-ifs for an hour, which is why I tell myself it’s ‘responsible adulting.’ But the guilt? It lingers like the aftertaste. I’ve tried replacing it with the garden—pruning at 2 a.m. instead of drinking—but my brain just shifts the worry to ‘overwatering’ the thyme. Work used to be my alternative, but now even that feels like digging a hole to bury the fatigue. It’s ironic, right? I can’t out-plant my father’s shadow.

interviewer: It’s clear how deeply embedded these patterns are, especially given their roots in your upbringing. Have you had similar episodes in the past where stress led to these cycles of overcompensation—like with work or alcohol—and if so, what strategies or support systems helped you navigate those times?

patient: I... I suppose there were times at work where I’d stay late ‘voluntarily’ to avoid the dread of unfinished tasks. It sounds irrational, but the act of crossing things off—a report, a deadline—it felt like a temporary fix. As for support... I never really leaned on anyone. My father’s example was... loud. If I messed up, I’d just work harder to compensate. The whiskey? That’s... it’s a Band-Aid on a leaky pipe. What’s helped lately is my daughter’s success—her promotion gave me something to focus on that wasn’t my own what-ifs. But I’m not sure if that counts as a strategy or just... luck.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing so openly. Have you noticed any periods in the last few months where you felt unusually energetic or didn't need as much sleep as usual?

patient: There have been nights where I... stayed up later than I should have, but I tell myself it's just... work deadlines or the garden needing attention. The whiskey helps, but I try not to think too much about it. It's not like I'm... you know, completely out of control or anything.

interviewer: I hear how the whiskey feels like a practical tool for you, even if it brings some guilt. How often do you find yourself reaching for the whiskey, and how much typically?

patient: It’s… a few times a week, usually just one glass after work. Sometimes two if the reports are particularly… stubborn. I tell myself it’s ‘responsible adulting’ rather than what it really is. The guilt creeps in when I think about my father’s lectures on self-discipline, but honestly, if that half-hour of quiet isn’t worth a glass, what’s the point? I just… don’t want it to become a thing, you know?

interviewer: I hear how the whiskey feels like a practical tool for you, even if it brings some guilt. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol use patterns recently, such as needing more to feel its effects or using it to cope with specific emotions?

patient: It’s... harder to ignore the pattern now, honestly. The last few months, one glass often feels like a placeholder for two. If the stress builds up—like when my daughter’s promotion coincided with those overlapping deadlines—I’ll... stretch the ‘responsible’ part a bit. It’s not like I’m chasing a buzz, but the quiet it buys me? It’s become a non-negotiable. My shoulders even hurt less afterward, which I guess is ironic since my father would call that ‘weakness.’ I just... don’t want it to spiral, but the line’s getting blurrier.

interviewer: It sounds like the boundaries you're trying to maintain around alcohol use are becoming more challenging to navigate. Have you noticed any other substances or habits you've turned to for similar relief or stress management recently?

patient: The garden’s been… absorbing, I guess. I’ll check the soil pH at odd hours, prune the thyme until it’s… precise. It’s just plants, but the routine feels like a… a small victory over chaos. And the crime shows, sure—mind-numbing noise. Doesn’t fix the rest, but it’s… something. Doesn’t sound dramatic enough, does it?

interviewer: I hear how the garden and crime shows offer a sense of control amidst the chaos. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: No, not in the way you might think. I mean, there are nights when the whiskey makes the silence feel... louder, if that makes sense. But it’s not about wanting to stop existing. It’s more like wishing the noise in my head would just pause long enough to remember how to breathe. The garden’s helped, actually—digging in the soil feels like a small rebellion against all the what-ifs. Even if my hands are still shaky afterward.

interviewer: I hear how the garden offers a sense of control even when your hands feel shaky. Have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts recently?

patient: No, nothing like that. I mean, my mind does... wander in circles sometimes, like a stuck sprinkler spraying the same worries over and over. But it’s not delusions—it’s just my brain’s way of over-preparing for disasters that probably won’t happen. Though I will say, I’ve caught myself double-checking my daughter’s bank statements more times than I should. Not out of distrust, just... habit. Apologies, that’s probably rambling again.

interviewer: I hear how the habit of checking your daughter’s bank statements feels like an extension of your need for control. Have you used any other substances, such as cannabis, stimulants, or prescription medications, for stress relief or to manage your thoughts?

patient: No, nothing else. The whiskey’s... it’s the only thing that feels manageable, if that makes sense. My doctor did prescribe a beta blocker once for a presentation, but I forgot to take it. Apologies—this must sound contradictory, given how much I talk about control. It’s just... adding variables feels like another equation I might botch.

interviewer: I hear how the beta blocker from your doctor sits in that same tension between control and overwhelm. Could you share any other medications or supplements you're currently taking, including prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal products?

patient: No other medications, really—just a daily multivitamin, which I’m probably overthinking by mentioning. My doctor suggested it for ‘general wellness,’ and I… I guess I like the idea of covering all bases, even the ones I can’t quantify. The beta blocker was a one-time thing, and honestly, forgetting to take it feels like a small victory in a way. Apologies, that’s another one of those rambling analogies I shouldn’t bother you with.

interviewer: I hear how the multivitamin represents your effort to maintain control through preparation. Have you noticed any medical conditions or physical symptoms, such as thyroid issues, chronic pain, or sleep apnea, that might be contributing to your current stress or sleep difficulties?

patient: No major diagnoses, but... my hands do tremble when I'm at my desk late, and my back aches from sitting too long. The sleep? It's there, but... shallow. The whiskey helps me *fall* asleep, but not stay there. Apologies, I know that’s vague. The garden’s the only thing that feels... grounded, if that makes sense.

interviewer: I hear how the physical symptoms feel like a byproduct of the mental strain. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions that might contribute to your current symptoms, such as chronic pain, thyroid issues, or sleep disorders? --FUNCTION-- end_phase --FUNCTION--

patient: No major diagnoses, just the usual suspects—back pain from sitting too long, maybe. My doctor says it’s ‘muscle tension’ but I think we both know it’s just... stress manifesting. Sleep? Let’s say my circadian rhythm and I aren’t on the same page these days. I take a multivitamin ‘just in case’—you know how it is. The garden’s the only thing that feels like due diligence on self-care, even if it’s just thyme for patience literally.

interviewer: So, to recap: You've described a pattern of chronic anxiety tied to perfectionism and a need for control, worsened by work pressures, financial worries, and the aftermath of your divorce. You've been using alcohol as a coping mechanism, though it brings guilt, and you're worried about modeling these habits for your daughter. Your gardening offers some relief, but obsessive checking behaviors persist. What did I miss?

patient: Oh—right. The neighbor’s toddler. I swear those decibels are eroding my eardrums. What if I develop tinnitus? It’s irrational, but I’ve been preemptively Googling noise-canceling headphones like they’re some kind of insurance policy. And... the whiskey. I keep telling myself it’s ‘responsible adulting,’ but sometimes I wonder if I’m just rehearsing how to be present for my daughter when I’m not even present for myself. It’s all just... more loops on the hamster wheel, isn’t it? At least the garden’s a small victory over chaos. Most days.

interviewer: Let’s review next steps. We can schedule your next session and discuss strategies to manage stress without relying on alcohol. Would you like to go over these now?

patient: Let’s do the next session. I’ll need the reminder—not because I don’t want to fix this, but because my calendar’s a Rorschach test of ‘what if I forget?’ The garden’s the only thing I mark off without second-guessing… even then, I check the seedlings at midnight. And the toddler—ugh. I bought noise-canceling headphones, but what if they’re not enough? It’s just… more data points in the chaos. But yes, let’s talk strategies. Just don’t judge the thyme for patience thing.

interviewer: It makes sense to lean on routines like the garden when the rest feels unpredictable. Let’s confirm your next session—would you prefer a phone call, email, or app reminder to flag it in your calendar? And is there anything specific you’d like to focus on before we wrap up?

patient: App reminder, please—my phone’s the only calendar entry I trust not to rewrite in my sleep. Let’s… untangle the toddler’s decibels and the whiskey’s ‘responsible’ vs. ‘enough’ thing. Also, my daughter’s college loan guilt keeps looping with my father’s voice. It’s all just… variables in the same equation. Sorry, I’m a Type-A mess. At least the thyme isn’t wilting. Yet.

interviewer: Your app reminder is set for the next session. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to address or clarify about the strategies we discussed?

patient: No, I think that’s… that’s the due diligence checklist for now. The app reminder’s my one non-negotiable variable, and the garden’s a control group I can actually trust. The rest? Just… more equations without a calculator. Thanks for not laughing at the thyme metaphor. I’ll try not to rewrite the session notes in my head later. Also, I might need to Google if tinnitus is hereditary. The toddler’s still a wild card.
