system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: I can hear how overwhelming this has been for you. Would you be comfortable proceeding with our conversation today as we talk through what's been going on?

patient: Sure, I guess. It’s not like I can avoid it forever. I just hope I don’t ramble too much—my brain’s always looping the same tracks, you know? Might need to adjust my ring though, it’s been giving me a headache from fidgeting with it all morning.

interviewer: It sounds like this has been a really challenging time for you. Can you tell me when you first noticed these feelings of overwhelm and racing thoughts starting?

patient: It’s hard to pin down the exact start, but I’d say… maybe six months ago? My partner was acting off, like tired all the time, and I couldn’t shake the idea he might be sick. It’s silly, I know—maybe I just absorb other people’s stress or something. My mom always said I was a worrier. Anyway, it’s like my brain just… loops the same track, you know? Even now, my shoulders feel like they’re carrying a backpack full of bricks.

interviewer: It sounds like this constant worry is really taking a toll on your body and mind. What are you hoping to achieve through coming in for this session?

patient: I guess I just want to... figure out how to turn down the volume in my head. Even a little. Like, if I could stop checking the locks three times a night or fidgeting with this ring until it hurts, that’d be something. My boss mentioned I’ve been slow at work lately, and I don’t want to let people down.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight you're carrying is really impacting your daily life. Have you experienced periods in the past where you felt similarly overwhelmed with worry and racing thoughts?

patient: Honestly? Yeah, it’s like… I’ve always had this ‘background noise’ of, I don’t know, expecting the worst. Like when my dad was sick growing up, I’d stay up nights imagining every possible way things could go wrong. My hands would get all twitchy then too, same as now. But I guess I just… learned to live with it? Or maybe I’m just better at hiding it now. My mom always called it ‘being a worrywart,’ so I kind of… filed it under ‘my problem,’ you know?

interviewer: It sounds like this pattern of worry has been a long-standing part of your life, shaped by experiences like your dad's illness. Have you noticed any family members who also struggle with similar patterns of worry or anxiety?

patient: My mom? Yeah, she’s always been… intense about everything needing to be just right. Like, if a dish isn’t spotless, she’d lose her mind. But I think she hid it under control, you know? She never sat there fretting out loud like I do. My brother’s the opposite—chill, doesn’t stress about anything. Sometimes I wonder if I just… inherited her ‘intensity’ and turned it into overthinking. [Fidgets with ring] It’s weird, though. She’d say I’m just a worrywart, but… maybe there’s truth to it?

interviewer: It's interesting how family patterns can shape our experiences in ways we don't always recognize. Can you share a bit about someone in your life who has been a source of support during stressful times?

patient: My partner, Jake—he’s the most patient person I’ve ever met. Even when I loop the same worries over and over, he just… listens. Like, last week I was stuck on the pipes freezing again and he said, ‘We’ll fix them together,’ and that’s it. [Fidgets with ring] And Mr. Whiskers, my cat, he’s calm in a way that makes me feel like I should be too. Feeding him, watching him eat—forces me to focus on something small that doesn’t require me to ‘solve’ anything. I guess… it’s weird, though. I worry so much about letting them down, you know? Like, what if I’m just… too much?

interviewer: It sounds like you've been under a lot of pressure lately. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life in the past few months?

patient: No, not like that. I don’t know if that’s what you’re asking… I get overwhelmed, sure, but even when I’m at my worst, part of me knows I can’t let the cat down or Jake. [fidgets with ring] Though sometimes I wonder if they’d be better off if I just… focused less, you know? It’s not like I’d ever actually— [shakes head] That’s not it. I just feel like such a weight to everyone.

interviewer: It sounds like you carry a lot of responsibility for those you care about. Who or what helps you feel supported when things feel overwhelming?

patient: Jake’s the main one, for sure. Even when I’m looping about stupid stuff, he just… grounds me. Like, he’ll say, ‘Shannon, breathe,’ and it’s weird, it actually works. [Fidgets with ring] And Mr. Whiskers—feeding him forces me to sit still for five minutes. I guess… the cooking shows help too? They’re so calm, you know? Like, no drama, just… sizzling and herbs. [Soft chuckle] Maybe I’m just bad at asking for help, but as long as I’ve got those things, I don’t feel totally lost.

interviewer: It’s clear how much those supports mean to you. Have you ever had periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed less sleep, even when you weren’t busy or stressed?

patient: No, not really. I’m usually too tired to even think about being energetic. Even when I’m up late worrying, it’s just… my brain spinning, not in a ‘I don’t need sleep’ way. [Fidgets with ring] My mom always said I was a worrier, not a night owl or anything.

interviewer: It sounds like your energy levels have been consistently low. Have you noticed any changes in your sensory experiences, like hearing voices, seeing things, or having thoughts that feel unusual or confusing to you?

patient: No, nothing like that. My head just feels... busy, you know? Like the same thoughts looping. I twist this ring a lot, helps me not咬舌. But I guess it’s just my brain being its usual noisy self.

interviewer: I notice how much your mind is working hard to manage everything. Have you been using alcohol, cannabis, or any other substances to cope with the stress lately, or is there a change in how you’ve used them recently?

patient: I have a glass of wine most nights. Helps me… settle, I guess? Not enough to affect anything, just enough to feel still for a bit. It’s not like I’m hiding from it or anything—more like… giving myself a 10-minute break from the loop.

interviewer: It sounds like the wine provides a small pause in the mental loop. Have you used any other substances, like cannabis or medications, to manage stress or symptoms recently?

patient: Nope, just the wine. I mean, I’ve tried edibles once at a party, but it just made my head feel... weirder. Can’t really joke about that stuff, you know? It’s not like I’m experimenting—wine’s my only ‘ritual.’ Helps me not overthink Mr. Whiskers’ kibble portions, honestly.

interviewer: It seems alcohol is the primary coping mechanism you’ve explored. Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, or over-the-counter remedies for your symptoms or other health concerns?

patient: No meds or supplements, really. Just the wine—my mom always said pills are for people who can’t handle their own head, you know? I mean, I’ve thought about melatonin for the sleep stuff, but what’s the point if I’m just lying there worrying anyway? Mr. Whiskers keeps me grounded, I guess. He’s a better therapist than any pill ever could be.

interviewer: Shannon, from what you've shared, it sounds like you've been managing a long-standing pattern of worry and physical tension, which has intensified over the past six months, especially with concerns about your partner's health and daily stressors. You’ve described how these thoughts affect your sleep, work focus, and relationships, while relying on routines and support from Jake and Mr. Whiskers to cope. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?

patient: You got the basics right, I guess. Maybe missed how my head feels like a broken record sometimes—same songs, just louder. And the money stuff with my mom? It’s not a huge thing, but it’s another ‘what if’ in the pile. What if I mess that up too? But hey, at least Mr. Whiskers doesn’t judge my math.

interviewer: Shannon, I’ll try to summarize what we’ve covered: You’ve described a long-standing pattern of racing, looping thoughts—like a broken record on repeat—that’s gotten louder and harder to ignore over the past six months. These worries about your partner’s health, money with your mom, and work performance have left you physically tense, sleep-deprived, and emotionally drained, even as you rely on routines, your partner Jake, and Mr. Whiskers to ground you. We’ve also touched on how this anxiety feels tied to family patterns and your fear of being a burden. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: I think you got most of it right, like the 'broken record' part—that’s exactly how it feels. But maybe you missed how my mom’s money stuff is... it’s not just pressure, it’s like she’s testing me or something. Like, ‘Can you handle this? Prove you’re responsible.’ And I keep thinking maybe if I worry harder, I can fix it before she notices I’m failing. Oh, and my hands? They haven’t stopped fidgeting with this ring since you asked about it. Feels like my brain’s on a loop but my body’s... stuck in the grooves.

interviewer: Shannon, I appreciate you sharing those details about your mom's dynamic and the physical restlessness with your hands. It sounds like there's a mix of mental and physical loops you're navigating. What else might I have missed about how these patterns show up for you?

patient: I guess… sometimes I catch myself redoing things at work, like measuring the same spot three times. My supervisor said I’m slowing folks down, but I just… can’t shake the ‘what if I miss something’ feeling. And the wine at night? It’s not about getting drunk—just trying to feel still for a bit. My hands still twist that ring even when I’m trying to eat. It’s like my body’s worried even when my head’s tired.

interviewer: Shannon, putting this all together, it seems your anxiety shows up as mental loops, physical restlessness (like fidgeting with your ring), and checking behaviors at work, all while using small rituals and wine to manage overwhelm. Your mom’s dynamic adds pressure, making you feel like you’re constantly proving your responsibility. What did I miss about how this feels for you or how it shapes your days?

patient: I think you’re right about the loops, but maybe you’re not seeing how much I’m… cutting myself off. Like, I’ll lay in bed at night, my head buzzing with ‘what-ifs,’ but my body’s so tight I can’t even get comfortable. And the wine? It’s not just a ritual—it’s the only time I don’t feel like I’m failing. Like, if I can just hold it together until then, I’m ‘okay.’ But my hands still twist that ring even when I’m trying to read. It’s like… my brain won’t turn off, but my body’s screaming ‘stop,’ and I’m stuck in between.

interviewer: Shannon, it sounds like you're caught between a mind that won't quiet down and a body that's physically crying out for rest, with the wine acting as your only temporary escape. What would you like to focus on next as we think about how to support you?

patient: I guess… if there’s a way to turn down the volume in my head, even a little? And maybe stop my hands from fidgeting so much. I don’t want to be a bother, but if I could just… not be so tight all the time? Even when I’m trying to read, my shoulders still hunch up like I’m waiting for something to go wrong. Maybe that’s too much to ask?

interviewer: It sounds like you're navigating a constant tension between your mind's urgency and your body's need for stillness, with the wine offering brief respite but not true relief. What would you most want to address first as we think about strategies to help with the mental 'volume' and physical restlessness?

patient: I think… if we could start with the loops in my head? Like, if I could just pause that constant ‘what if’ reel even for an hour, maybe my hands would stop fidgeting so much. But I don’t want to sound selfish—maybe that’s too much? Feels like if the noise quieted down, the rest might… catch up?

interviewer: It makes sense to start where you feel it’s most urgent. Would you say focusing on quieting the mental loops is the main area you’d like us to address first, or is there something else that feels more pressing?

patient: I guess the loops are the biggest one, yeah. It’s like my brain’s on a broken record, you know? But… there’s this thing with my mom and the savings account that I haven’t even told her about. It’s making me check my bank app like 20 times a day. (fidgets with ring) And the wine at night—I know it’s not helping, but sometimes I just need five minutes where my thoughts don’t feel like they’re screaming. Is that bad to admit?

interviewer: Shannon, I hear how the loops in your head and the pressure around your mom’s savings feel like they’re tangled together, making it hard to unwind. Let me try to pull this all together: We’ve talked about your long-standing anxiety loops, physical restlessness, checking behaviors at work and with money, and using wine to find brief calm. Your mom’s dynamic adds pressure to prove you’re responsible, and your body’s tightness feels like it’s screaming for stillness you can’t find. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You got the big stuff right, I think. The loops, the checking, the wine... it’s all there. Maybe what’s missing is how my body feels like it’s on a constant 'hold your breath' mode? Like, even when I’m trying to relax, my shoulders are still hunched like I’m waiting for something to drop. And Mr. Whiskers? He’s the only thing that makes me feel like I’m not just... a ball of nerves. But yeah, the savings thing? That’s a newer layer, I guess. It’s like my mom’s putting a weight on me I don’t know how to carry without it crushing me. (fidgets with ring) But I’m getting off track, aren’t I?

interviewer: Shannon, I appreciate you sharing how your body feels like it's constantly holding its breath and the added pressure around your mom's savings. It sounds like these layers are compounding your sense of overwhelm. What else feels important to correct or add before we think about next steps?

patient: I think that’s… most of it. The only other thing is how my mind just… won’t let me rest, you know? Even when I’m trying to focus on Mr. Whiskers or whatever, my brain’s like, ‘But what if the pipes freeze AND the savings crash AND Jake gets sick?’ All at once. (fidgets with ring) It’s like carrying a backpack full of rocks, but I keep adding more instead of putting some down. Does that make sense?

interviewer: It sounds like the mental loops and physical tension are deeply intertwined for you, with Mr. Whiskers being one of the few things that offers relief. What would you like to explore first in terms of strategies or support to address these patterns?

patient: I think... maybe starting with the loops first? Like, if I could learn to 'turn down the volume' even a little, maybe the checking and the wine would feel less necessary? (fidgets with ring) But I don’t want to sound like I’m making excuses—my boss already thinks I’m ‘overzealous’ with the measuring. (pauses, then softer) Mr. Whiskers helps, but he can’t stay with me at work. Maybe there’s a way to... carry that calm with me somehow?

interviewer: I hear how starting with the mental loops feels like a key step for you, even with the worry about how it might look at work. Before we move forward, is there anything about this plan or our discussion so far that feels off or needs adjusting?

patient: No, I think you’ve got it right. The plan makes sense… it’s just, the work thing? My boss already thinks I’m ‘overzealous,’ so slowing down feels like walking a tightrope. (fidgets with ring) And the savings pressure? It’s like adding another rock to that backpack. My shoulders just… (pauses, gestures to hunched posture) …they don’t even relax when I’m trying to breathe. But Mr. Whiskers? He’s my tiny anchor. (soft, almost to herself) Even if he’s not there when I’m measuring pipes.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot of mental weight lately—thank you for sharing so openly. Before we wrap up, can you tell me if there’s anything specific you’d like to make sure we’ve addressed today?

patient: I guess… making sure it’s okay that I check things a lot? Not really a problem, just… my way. And maybe the money stuff with my mom? It’s not huge, but it’s there. My hands won’t stop fidgeting, though—probably just my brain being loud again.

interviewer: It sounds like managing these checking habits and financial worries are important to you. Before we finish, can you share what steps you’d feel ready to try first for managing the mental ‘noise’ and hand fidgeting?

patient: Maybe… starting with just trying to breathe slower when I catch myself fidgeting? Like, count to five or something. And maybe not drinking wine every night—my head feels foggy in the mornings. It’s silly, but Mr. Whiskers helps me focus on something else for a bit. I guess I could try… writing down the worries instead of looping them? Not sure, though. It’s not like I’ve got a magic fix.

interviewer: It sounds like you're taking some thoughtful steps to manage the overwhelm. Before we finish, is there anything else you'd like to adjust or clarify about these plans?

patient: I guess maybe... trying not to twist my ring so much? It’s just a habit, but my fingers feel like they’re gonna fall off sometimes. And maybe the money stuff with my mom... I don’t want to be a burden, but it’s hard not to think about it. Everything else feels... manageable? I hope.

interviewer: It sounds like you’ve identified some meaningful steps to address both the physical tension and financial worries. Before we finish, is there anything else you’d like to adjust or add to these plans for the coming week?

patient: I guess maybe... trying to focus on breathing more when the ring-twisting starts? It’s just a habit, but my fingers feel like they’re gonna fall off sometimes. And maybe not let the money stuff with my mom eat at me so much... but I don’t know. Mr. Whiskers helps, at least.
