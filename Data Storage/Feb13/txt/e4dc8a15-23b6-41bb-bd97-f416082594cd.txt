system: Session e4dc8a15-23b6-41bb-bd97-f416082594cd transcript

system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: It sounds like this has been really challenging for you. Can you confirm you're comfortable proceeding with this session today?

patient: I’m here, aren’t I? Just… let me double-check my playlist for grounding. (pauses, self-conscious) It’s a bit of a stress ball moment, but sure, let’s proceed.

interviewer: That sounds really tough. Do you have any questions about how today’s session will work before we begin?

patient: Honestly, I think I know the drill—just don’t expect me to remember the playlist after we start. I’ll probably just end up baking in my head to stay grounded. (pauses, then softly laughs) Does that make sense or am I rambling again?

interviewer: Can you tell me more about the main concerns that brought you here today, in your own words?

patient: It’s… work stuff, mostly. My clients’ cases tend to bleed into my head at odd hours. And, well, money things with my partner’s freelance work, but we’re… adapting. (pauses, rubs neck) My shoulders feel like live wires these days. I guess I overanalyze everything, though—like, what if I’m not ‘doing’ therapy right? (soft laugh) Sounds ridiculous, right?

interviewer: It sounds like the self-doubt about your therapy practice is adding to your stress. When did you first notice these worries starting to affect your work or personal life?

patient: It’s been... a slow creep, honestly. Maybe three years ago when I started private practice? I told myself it was just 'burnout,' you know? But lately, I missed two client appointments because I couldn’t shake this... knot in my chest. (Pauses, rubs shoulders) Even小事 like my dishwasher leaking stress me out. I’ll fix it, but then I just worry it’ll break again when I’m short on cash. (Soft laugh) It’s all connected, I guess?

interviewer: It sounds like the physical tension and sleep disruption are compounding your stress. What would you most hope to achieve through therapy right now?

patient: Honestly? I guess I just want to... unclench. Like, my shoulders are always locked up tight, and I’m tired of feeling like a human stress ball. If therapy could help me stop overthinking every little thing—like, you know, the door locks, the dishwasher, *everything*—and actually *sleep* for once, that’d be... something. But I don’t want to sound dramatic. It’s probably just burnout, right?

interviewer: It sounds like the physical tension and sleep issues are really affecting your daily life. Have you sought any help or tried specific strategies for these concerns before starting therapy here?

patient: I’ve tried... you know, the usual stuff. Mindfulness apps, making playlists to stay busy, even baking to ‘reset’? But the worrying’s like static—it’s always there. I tell myself it’s just burnout, but my body doesn’t exactly agree. My shoulders? Still a human stress ball. The dishwasher thing... I guess I’m learning you can’t just will yourself to stop hyperfixating on whether it’s leaking at 2 a.m.

interviewer: It sounds like the tension and worry have been really persistent for you. Have you experienced similar episodes of anxiety or stress in the past, particularly since starting your private practice, and if so, what helped you manage them?

patient: Before private practice, I... I used to talk through it with a colleague sometimes. Like, just venting about supervisees’ cases bleeding into my head? That’d help, I guess. But it’s like putting a Band-Aid on a live wire—temporary, but the static’s still there. Honestly, the only thing that *really* helps is... well, working through it? Even if it’s messy. Which is why I’m here. Fingers crossed this time, therapy can actually quiet the noise instead of just... acknowledging it exists.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been trying to navigate this internally even when it feels messy. Can you tell me more about what 'working through it' looks like for you in practice—does it involve specific strategies, or is it more about tolerating the discomfort until it subsides?

patient: Working through it... I guess it’s like baking? You follow the steps, but your cookies still end up half-burnt. I try to stay busy—over-scheduling clients so there’s no time to hyperfixate on the dishwasher or door locks. But lately, even that’s slipping. Last week, I missed a session because my chest felt like a vice, and I just... froze. It’s embarrassing, really. I tell myself it’s ‘normal’ burnout, but my body’s like, ‘no, we’re doing this static thing forever.’ Though... sometimes it works? Like when I actually finish a playlist without second-guessing every note. Or my partner laughs—then I forget to worry for, like,三十 seconds.

interviewer: It sounds like your partner's presence can provide some relief. How has your relationship been supporting you through these stressful times?

patient: My partner... he’s good at making me laugh, which helps, like when he mocks my playlist obsessions. And he’ll listen when I vent about work, which is nice. But... there’s this unspoken thing about money. His van repairs, my therapy bills—it’s like we both pretend the stress ball isn’t getting heavier. I guess I worry I’m not ‘handling it’ well enough, but he just says, ‘Breathe, Kelly.’ Easier said when your chest isn’t a vice, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like financial stress is a significant, unspoken weight in your relationship. How has this dynamic specifically contributed to your anxiety over time—has it felt similar to past stressors, or does it feel uniquely challenging now?

patient: It’s... complicated. Financial stress feels different now. Before, I was just hyper-focused on job performance or client outcomes—like, if I worked harder, everything would ‘fix.’ But this? It’s like we’re both holding a stress ball, but we’re not even looking at each other’s hands. I guess I worry he’s hiding how much debt he’s in, and I’m terrified to ask. Last week, I caught myself double-checking the dishwasher’s manual for a repair hack... it’s $200 I don’t have. My shoulders remember every worry. But weirdly, his laugh still feels like an anchor sometimes. It’s just... quieter now.

interviewer: I appreciate you sharing that. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life in the past few weeks?

patient: I don’t know... I guess I’ve had days where I think, ‘What if I just... vanished?’ But it’s more like a tired joke, you know? I can’t see through that fog. Plus, I’ve got clients depending on me—how would they react if I... you know? Hypocrite much, right?

interviewer: It sounds like you're using humor to cope with overwhelming feelings. Have you ever taken those thoughts of vanishing seriously, even a little?

patient: It’s more like... static in the background. I tell myself it’s just exhaustion, you know? Like my brain’s stuck on loop. But then I think about my clients—how would they react if I... you know. So I laugh it off, even though my shoulders remember every time. The dishwasher’s probably leaking again, and I’ll just fix it tomorrow. Or maybe not.

interviewer: It sounds like the physical tension is really weighing on you. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or restlessness lately, even with the sleep disruptions?

patient: Honestly? I feel like a flickering lightbulb most days—like I’m running on low battery but my brain won’t let me power down. My legs feel... heavy, like they’re made of sand, but my head’s still on loop about the dishwasher or a client’s note I forgot to file. I caught myself pacing my apartment last night ‘to burn off energy’ but it was just my anxiety needing a workout. It’s weird, right? You’re tired but you can’t *stop* moving. My partner says I’m ‘a human stress ball,’ which I guess is accurate… though I’d prefer a better metaphor if one exists.

interviewer: It sounds like your body and mind are in constant conflict right now. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol, cannabis, or other substance use recently, or do you currently use any medications or supplements to manage your symptoms?

patient: Honestly? I’ve stuck to chamomile tea and the occasional ‘stress ball compr—oh wait, that’s just my hands. (pauses, then softens) I take a muscle relaxer sometimes for my neck, but it’s more... reactive than proactive. Like, I’ll pop it after a session when my shoulders feel like they’re auditioning for a statue. My partner jokes I need a prescription for ‘adult nap time,’ but... (shrugs) I’m not there yet.

interviewer: I hear how your body feels like it's caught between needing to rest and being on high alert. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or restless, even when you're physically exhausted?

patient: Hmm. It’s like... my body’s stuck on a hamster wheel sometimes. Last week, I was too wired to sleep after a client session—even though I felt like I’d run a marathon. I kept... redoing my to-do list in my head, you know? Even when I’m crashing, my mind’s still scrubbing the floors or checking if the door’s locked for the 10th time. It’s absurd. My partner jokes I’m a human stress ball—tight as a knot, but bouncing anyway.

interviewer: It sounds like your physical tension and restless energy are really interfering with your daily life. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or having strong beliefs that feel unusual or hard to let go of?

patient: No, nothing like voices or... strange beliefs. I think my head’s just a mess of overthinking? Like, I’ll catch myself replaying client sessions or calculating how many days until the dishwasher payment is due. It’s not that I believe anything bizarre—it’s more like my brain’s stuck on a loop of ‘practical’ worries. My partner jokes I’m a squirrel with OCD, hoarding acorns for a winter that might not exist.

interviewer: It seems like the thought of 'vanishing' might be a way to cope with the weight you're carrying. Have you ever felt that this thought was more than just exhaustion, like a real escape you might consider if things didn’t get better?

patient: It’s not... I don’t know. Sometimes I imagine just... dissolving, but I tell myself it’s just exhaustion. Like my brain’s short-circuiting from too much static. But then I think about my clients—what would they say if I disappeared? Probably that I’m a hypocrite. So I cling to the small things, you know? My partner’s laugh, a good therapy session. Proof I’m still... doing it right.

interviewer: It sounds like your clients and partner are important anchors for you. What helps you feel most connected to them or gives you a sense of stability when things feel overwhelming?

patient: I guess baking helps? It’s like... following a recipe forces my brain to focus on measurements instead of spiraling. And my partner’s laugh, even if it’s quieter now. I cling to those things, even if they feel small. Like, if I can measure flour correctly, maybe everything else will... not fall apart. It’s cheesy, I know.

interviewer: It’s meaningful that you find small anchors in baking and your partner’s presence. Have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or need less sleep, even when you’re physically exhausted?

patient: It’s like... I’m running on fumes but still stuck in overdrive? Last night, I stayed up until 2 a.m. reorganizing my client files even though my legs felt like sandbags. Baking helps ground me, though—following a recipe forces me to focus on measurements instead of... whatever’s looping in my head. My partner says I’m a stress ball with a caffeine addiction. Which is true, I guess. But even when I’m crashing, my brain’s still scrubbing the floors metaphorically. Or literally, sometimes.

interviewer: It sounds like your energy levels are conflicting with your physical exhaustion. Have you been using alcohol or cannabis to manage your stress or symptoms recently?

patient: No, I don’t use anything like that. I’m more of a... caffeine addict, I guess? Coffee, tea, the usual. It’s my way of feeling like I’m in control, you know? If I don’t, I get antsy. My partner jokes that I’m a human espresso machine. Oh, and I bake a lot. It’s weird, but measuring flour and sugar feels like the only time my brain stops looping. Though my cookies usually end up half-burnt—guess that’s my version of a stress ball.

interviewer: It sounds like caffeine and baking help you manage stress in your own way. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements besides the muscle relaxer you mentioned earlier?

patient: No, just the muscle relaxer when it’s really bad. Maybe a multivitamin sometimes? My partner keeps suggesting magnesium for the tension, but I’m like, ‘Do we even have money for fancy supplements?’ It’s silly, I know—just another thing to stress about.

interviewer: I appreciate your openness about managing symptoms with what’s available. Are you currently taking any other medications or supplements besides the muscle relaxer and multivitamin?

patient: No, that’s pretty much it. The multivitamin’s more of a ‘I should be taking something’ thing than actual consistency. My partner’s obsessed with magnesium for the muscle tension, but… we’re both too cheap for specialty supplements. It’s a running joke—we’d probably just end up buying dark chocolate and calling it ‘self-care.’
