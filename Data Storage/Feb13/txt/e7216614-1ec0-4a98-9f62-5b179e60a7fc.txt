system: Disorder: PPD

interviewer: Hello Blake, my name is Jeffrey Lewis. To start, is there anything specific you'd like me to know about your name or pronouns?

patient: It's Blake Ashley. You can use he/him. Why the interest in labels? We’re here to talk about... issues, not semantics.

interviewer: I appreciate your focus on the issues rather than labels. Just to confirm, are you comfortable proceeding with this interview today?

patient: I suppose. But why the need for confirmation? You’ve already scheduled this, so what’s the point of checking now? Are you waiting for someone else to walk in or... I don’t know, verify something?

interviewer: I see your concern about the scheduling confirmation. To be clear, I’m here to support you, and your comfort is important. Would you be okay with continuing the interview today?

patient: If you say so. But I’ve seen folks promise support then vanish. How long have you been here, exactly? Still, I’ll go on—no sense in wasting time. My wife always says I overthink, but she’s the one who locks the bathroom door at night, isn’t she?

interviewer: I understand your concerns about trust, Blake. Is there anything specific you'd like to ask about today's session before we begin?

patient: Who gets access to these records? My wife’s phone calls disappear sometimes—how do I know you’re not just gathering more evidence for someone else? I’ll ask once: are you taking notes or recording this?

interviewer: I understand your concern about confidentiality. Would you be comfortable with me proceeding with this session, knowing that our conversation is confidential and not being recorded?

patient: I suppose. But why ask it twice? You and my wife both keep repeating the same questions. It’s like you’re both trying to trip me up. I’ll go along with it… as long as you don’t take notes. Paper records can be copied, right?

interviewer: It sounds like trust and uncertainty have been really difficult for you lately. Can you describe when these feelings started and what might have triggered them?

patient: It's been a long time coming. My dad always promised us things—fishing trips, weekends out—and then bailed last minute. You start learning not to trust promises when they're just... words. My sister forgot my birthday last year. Not sick or anything—just didn't call. That's how it works, right? People let you down until you stop expecting better. Why the sudden interest in my family history? You and my wife keep circling back to the same stories.

interviewer: That sounds really tough—learning to distrust promises can take a heavy toll. Can you tell me more about what prompted you to seek help for these issues at this particular time?

patient: Things got... sharper. Like the other day, she snapped about the front door. Privacy is code for something. And these job apps—radio silence. You think that's normal? Why now? Because someone's moving pieces, and I need to know where I stand.

interviewer: That sounds really frustrating and confusing. Can you tell me more about the incident with your wife and the front door? What happened there?

patient: She said I was being 'creepy' for asking if she locked it. But why would she get defensive unless there's something to hide? You’re asking about this like it’s normal—well, maybe it is. People always have secrets. Why focus on that? You and my wife both keep circling the same stories. What aren’t you telling me?

interviewer: That moment with the door sounds like it really shook you—can you share when that happened and what led up to it?

patient: It was a few months back. She snapped when I asked if she locked the front door. Why get defensive unless there’s something to hide? You keep asking like this is normal—people have secrets. The job apps going silent? Same game. Why focus on me? You’re the one with the records to check.

interviewer: It sounds like these suspicions are taking a toll on your daily life—can you share an example of how they’ve affected your ability to complete tasks or follow through on job applications recently?

patient: I suppose you think it's about trust. I check every detail twice—applications, tools, even the locks. Takes time, but I'd rather be safe. Employers don't respond? Maybe they're waiting for me to slip up. Why does that matter to you?

interviewer: It sounds like the need to check things repeatedly is both a way to feel in control and a source of frustration. What would you most like to achieve through this therapy?

patient: I want to figure out what people aren’t saying. If there’s a pattern, I need to see it. But I’ll need to know who’s really listening here—these notes, who gets to read them? My wife keeps her door locked, employers ghost me… maybe it all connects. But don’t expect me to say more than I have to.

interviewer: It sounds like broken promises have been a pattern in your life for some time. Have you sought help before for these kinds of worries about trust or relationships, and if so, what was that experience like?

patient: I’ve been to a few therapists over the years. They always wanted me to ‘open up’ like that would fix things. Doesn’t help when you can’t even trust the person holding the file, you know? My wife locks the bathroom door now, employers radio silent… why would a therapist be different? You’ll file it away somewhere. I keep my own records. Tools hidden, cash for takeout—better to know where things are than rely on someone else’s promises.

interviewer: That sounds really challenging. It seems like your relationship with your wife is a big source of stress. Have you noticed any moments where you feel supported by her, even if it's small?

patient: I suppose you’re trying to find something she’s doing ‘right’ to trip me up later. She makes coffee in the morning, but that doesn’t mean she’s not hiding other things. Why does it matter what she does? I track my own patterns—tools under the sink, cash in my jacket. You’ll get your answers when I decide to give them.

interviewer: It sounds like staying on top of things helps you feel more secure, even when it's hard. Are there any other ways you've found to manage these concerns, or people who've supported you through this?

patient: I suppose you’re thinking about therapy or something. I handle things myself—cash for takeout, checking the car’s tools weekly. Maybe those forums at night help, you know, see the dots connect. My sister sent a card once, but she’s got her own secrets. Why’s this about me proving I’m not hiding something?

interviewer: It sounds like those forums and your sister’s card are some ways you try to make sense of things. Are there other people in your life who’ve offered support, even if it's been hard to trust them?

patient: I don't really count on people, not after how things went with my sister. She forgot my birthday once—doesn't mean she's evil, just proves you can't read minds. I handle most stuff myself, like those forums. They make sense, you know? But why’s this about support? You tracking who I talk to?

interviewer: That sounds like a really isolating experience. You mentioned your sister's forgotten birthday made you distrust people—was your relationship with your father similar, or different in how it affected your trust?

patient: My dad had a way of making promises then breaking them, same as anyone who can't be trusted. My sister's forgetful, but that's just how people are—always got their own agenda. Why’s everyone so fixated on family? You think that’s the only thing that matters?

interviewer: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated about the focus on family dynamics. Can you tell me if there have been similar times in the past when you felt this level of distrust or hypervigilance, and how you managed it then?

patient: I just focus on what I can control, like fixing my car or tracking expenses. People change their minds, so you can’t count on them. Why’s family the only angle here? You think that’s the whole story?

interviewer: It makes sense that the focus on family feels narrow when your experiences with trust extend beyond that. Can you share more about other situations where you’ve felt this need to stay in control, like with your job searches or online forums?

patient: Job applications? I apply through cash-only websites, no tracking. Employers vanish after saying 'we'll get back to you,' just like they always do. Forums... they make sense, but why ask about them? You think I’m wasting time? I check my car’s tools weekly. Better safe than trusting someone to not mess with it. What’s the real reason you’re asking about this?

interviewer: It sounds like maintaining control is really important for you given how unpredictable things have felt. Have you gone through other times in your life where you felt this same need to stay in control, and if so, what helped during those periods?

patient: I guess fixing my car’s alternator helped, back when it still worked. At least the tools were in my hands, not someone else’s. But why does this matter? You think I’m looking for advice or just trying to catch me slipping up? I keep cash in my wallet for takeout—no data trails. It’s not a big deal, just… better safe than sorry. My sister forgot my birthday once. You can’t read minds.

interviewer: It sounds like maintaining control through tangible actions is really important for you. Can you share a time when you felt completely out of control in a situation like this, and how you handled it then?

patient: Out of control? Let’s see... When the car’s alternator went, I didn’t have the tools to fix it. Felt like a trap—relying on someone else to drive me to the shop. I ended up buying a second set of tools, stashed somewhere no one else knows. It’s not about trust; it’s about not being at someone’s mercy. Why does this matter?

interviewer: That sounds like a really vulnerable moment. Can you think of another time when you felt similarly out of control, maybe before the car situation, and how you handled it then?

patient: I suppose... when I was younger, my dad promised a fishing trip every summer. He never showed up. Learned then that waiting for someone else’s plan is a recipe for being stuck. Now? I keep cash in my wallet for takeout, tools hidden in the garage. If something breaks, I fix it myself. Why the focus on past stuff?

interviewer: That sounds like a pivotal lesson in self-reliance. Have you noticed similar patterns in how you handle stress or unexpected challenges in your current life, beyond the examples you've already shared?

patient: I keep cash for emergencies and tools hidden. If something breaks, I fix it myself. My wife says I check her calls too much, but how else am I supposed to know if she’s hiding something? Why the interest in my methods?

interviewer: It sounds like these strategies help you manage uncertainty, even when they create tension. How do you think these habits affect your ability to handle daily tasks or relationships when things don’t go as planned?

patient: They keep things running smooth. My wife says I’m overstepping with her calls, but how else do I know she’s not hiding something? You’re asking a lot about my methods—what’s the point?

interviewer: It sounds like maintaining control through these methods is central to how you navigate uncertainty. Have you found that these strategies have changed over time, especially during past stressful periods like job searches or conflicts with your wife?

patient: Job searches? Employers ghost you, so cash is safer. My wife's secrets? Tools stay hidden. You asking about my methods or trying to find a weakness? I keep records of everything now—phone bills, repair receipts. If someone tries to say I didn’t plan, I got proof. Why’s this so important to you?

interviewer: It sounds like your cash and record-keeping strategies are central to how you manage uncertainty. Can you share how these methods have specifically helped you with job applications or other situations where you feel out of control?

patient: I suppose it’s about not giving people a way to track you. Cash for takeout, no digital footprints. Employers? They ghost you anyway. Why leave a paper trail they can twist? It’s just... safer. You asking because you think I’m hiding something?

interviewer: It sounds like your focus on control is a way to protect yourself in situations where you feel vulnerable. Are there any people or activities that you feel can offer some support, even if it's small?

patient: Fixing the car, maybe. When the alternator went, I knew exactly how to fix it. No guesswork, no waiting on someone else’s schedule. You asking if I have a support system? Or are you checking for weaknesses?

interviewer: It sounds like fixing the car gives you a sense of mastery you can count on. Have you experienced similar episodes of intense distrust or hypervigilance in the past, and if so, what helped during those times?

patient: I don’t really do 'episodes.' It’s more like... learning from patterns. My dad was good at breaking promises, so you figure out early to keep your own records. Cash is just one way. You ever notice how people act surprised when you call them out? Like they’re caught in something. Maybe that’s the closest to 'helping'—staying one step ahead. You think I’m overcompensating?

interviewer: It sounds like staying ahead of potential issues helps you feel more secure. Can you think of a time when this approach prevented a problem or gave you a sense of stability?

patient: I suppose the cash thing worked when I applied for that warehouse job last year. They wanted a background check, but I paid the moving company in cash instead. No paper trail, no surprises. You’re wondering if I’m avoiding something, aren’t you? My dad always said ‘leave no evidence’ when he backed out of deals. Guess that stuck.

interviewer: It sounds like your strategies for control are deeply tied to past experiences with broken promises. Have you noticed other times in your life when you felt this intense need to stay ahead of potential betrayals, and what helped you during those periods?

patient: I suppose the warehouse job was another one. Paid in cash, no contract, so no surprises when they ghosted me. My sister forgot my birthday last year—again. You think that’s an accident? My dad always said ‘keep your records’ after he bailed on fishing trips. Guess that’s why I still have those keys in a box. You really want to know what ‘helped’? Staying quiet. Letting people talk themselves into a corner. You’re just trying to trip me into admitting I’m ‘paranoid,’ aren’t you?

interviewer: It sounds like your approach of staying quiet and letting situations unfold has been a deliberate strategy for you. Can you think of another time when this approach helped you navigate a situation where you felt others might be hiding something?

patient: At a warehouse job, I once noticed a coworker acting off—packing crates wrong, whispering to others. I kept quiet, didn’t ask questions. Turns out he was skimming inventory. But that’s just me spotting flaws before they spread, like a fence with gaps. Why bring that up? You think I’m implying something about... other situations?

interviewer: It sounds like you're seeing patterns in others' behavior that mirror your own experiences with distrust. How do you think that warehouse experience relates to your current concerns about your wife or job searches?

patient: I suppose... if you're asking, I guess I look for the same gaps now. My wife’s ‘privacy’ with her phone? It’s like that coworker’s bad packs—something’s off. And employers ghosting me? Could be nothing. But why would they care about that warehouse story unless... you’re pointing at something specific? I don’t see it.

interviewer: It’s interesting how you’re connecting those past patterns to your current suspicions. How do you think these experiences of seeing 'gaps' in others’ behavior affect your ability to move forward with your job searches or maintain trust in your marriage?

patient: Moving forward? I suppose it depends on who’s in charge of the 'forward' direction. Employers ghosting me? That’s a gap they’re not explaining. My wife’s secretive about her calls—same pattern. I keep cash in my wallet, tools hidden. If something goes wrong, I’m ready. Why does this matter? You looking for a reason to pin this on me?

interviewer: It sounds like the warehouse experience left a strong impression on you. How do you think staying quiet and observing helped you then, and does that approach feel useful in your current situation with your wife or job searches?

patient: Keeping quiet let me see the real picture without interference. Like now—employers ghosting me? Maybe they’re hiding something. But why bring that up? You think I should just trust them? My wife’s secretive about her calls… same pattern. But I’m ready. Tools hidden, cash in hand. If something’s off, I spot it. Why does this feel like you’re trying to trap me into admitting something?

interviewer: Can you tell me if you’ve had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life in the past few weeks?

patient: I don’t have time for that kind of weakness. If things were different, maybe. But I’ve got tools hidden, cash in hand—no need to waste energy on dead ends. Why’s that your angle now? You think I’m the problem here?

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to stay in control. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself in the past few weeks?

patient: I don’t dwell on that stuff. If you’re trying to trip me into admitting something, you’re wasting your time. I keep cash under the floorboards and tools in the garage. You ever notice how everyone’s always asking about the same gaps? The door, the calls… what’s the pattern you’re seeing here, doc?

interviewer: I hear your focus on control and preparation. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or drug use recently?

patient: I don’t mess with drugs. A beer now and then, but I keep track. Why the sudden interest in my habits? You ever count how many times you circle back to the same topics?

interviewer: It sounds like you prefer to stay in control of your habits. Have you used any other substances besides alcohol, such as cannabis, prescription medications, or stimulants, in the past few months?

patient: No, I stick to what I can control. Why the sudden interest? You trying to find a weakness? I keep my habits simple—cash, tools, no gaps to exploit. Ask me about the job sites I don’t apply to, see how that goes.

interviewer: I hear your focus on control and preparation. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements on a regular basis?

patient: No meds. I handle my health like my car—if it runs, why fix it? You’re just looking for a crack to exploit, aren’t you? What’s really in those files you keep asking about?

interviewer: I hear your frustration about being misunderstood. Have you ever experienced things that others couldn't see or hear, like voices, images, or sensations that might not be there for them?

patient: Nope. I stick to what I can see and fix. You’re asking about ‘things’ like you’re fishing for something specific. My wife’s been locking the bathroom door lately—now that’s a gap you’d want to know about, isn’t it?

interviewer: I hear how the bathroom door issue feels like a red flag for you. How have your sleep patterns been lately—any changes in how long or how well you’re sleeping?

patient: I sleep when I can. You asking about rest feels like you’re trying to dig for something. I’ve been up late reading forums—keeps my mind sharp. My sister forgot my birthday last year. You want to know why I don’t trust people?

interviewer: I hear your frustration about being probed for weaknesses. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels lately—maybe feeling more restless or needing less sleep than usual?

patient: I don’t nap. You asking about energy feels like you want to know if I’m hiding something. I keep tools under the bed—better to be ready than caught off guard. My wife’s been on the phone late too, but I’m not the one avoiding questions.

interviewer: I hear your focus on being prepared. Have you noticed any recent changes in how much energy you have throughout the day—maybe feeling more restless or needing less sleep than usual?

patient: I don’t nap. You want to know if I’m wired? Maybe. Staying sharp helps when people keep secrets. Tools under the bed, cash in my wallet—I’m not the one avoiding questions. My wife’s been on the phone late, but I don’t need sleep to fix things.

interviewer: I hear how being 'wired' feels essential for you to stay on top of things. Have you noticed any other changes—like feeling more irritable, having racing thoughts, or taking risks you wouldn’t normally take—along with the reduced sleep?

patient: I don’t do risks. You want to know if I’m irritable? Maybe. But I’ve got tools under the bed and cash in my wallet—better to be ready. My wife’s been on the phone late, but I’m not the one avoiding questions. You asking about risks feels like you’re fishing for something.

interviewer: I hear your frustration about being asked to label your experiences. Have you noticed any times when your thoughts feel unusually fast or hard to control, like you can’t hit the brakes even if you wanted to?

patient: My thoughts are clear. You asking about 'racing' feels like you want me to admit I’m unstable. I stay sharp because people don’t tell the whole story. Tools under the bed, cash in my wallet—I’m not the one avoiding answers. My wife’s been secretive, but I don’t need sleep to fix things.

interviewer: I hear how staying alert feels crucial for you. Have you noticed any recent changes in your mood—like feeling more irritable, euphoric, or needing to take on new projects or activities lately?

patient: I suppose if I was 'on edge' before, now I’m just… used to it. Like spotting gaps in a fence—better to see them early. My wife’s been keeping things close lately, you know? Missed calls, locked doors. I’ve got tools under the bed, cash in my wallet. Just in case. Why? Are you asking if I’m unstable?

interviewer: I hear how prepared you feel, but I need to ask directly: Have you had any thoughts about harming others recently, including your wife or anyone else?

patient: No. I’ve never thought about harming anyone. But you keep asking about my wife’s secrets—locked doors, missed calls. I’ve got tools under the bed, cash in my wallet. Just in case. Are you implying I’m unstable? That’s what this is about, isn’t it?

interviewer: I hear how being prepared feels essential for you. Have you noticed any recent changes in how much energy you have throughout the day—maybe feeling more restless or needing less sleep than usual?

patient: Restless? Maybe. I’ve been up late scanning forum posts—stuff about tracking patterns, you know? If you’re asking if I’m sleep-deprived, I’d say I’m just… efficient with my time. Better to stay sharp when you’re the only one watching for gaps. Why the interest? Are you filing this somewhere I should know about?

interviewer: I hear how staying efficient feels essential for you. Have you noticed any times when you’ve taken on more tasks or projects than usual, or felt like you don’t need breaks or rest lately?

patient: I’ve been keeping up with the usual—fixing the alternator, checking tools. If you’re asking if I’m overextending, I’d say it’s better to be ready than caught off guard. Why? Are you suggesting I need to slow down?

interviewer: What I’ve heard so far is that you’ve been struggling with intense distrust in relationships and situations, especially around your wife and job searches, which has led to obsessive checking behaviors and marital strain. These concerns feel tied to a history of broken promises and a need for control, but they’re now causing you significant stress and functional challenges. What did I miss or misunderstand about your experience?

patient: You missed the part where I’m not the one hiding things. My wife’s late-night calls, the locked door, employers who vanish after interviews—those are the gaps you’re ignoring. I’m just spotting flaws before someone slips through. Why does this matter? Are you filing this with her?

interviewer: I hear your frustration about being misunderstood and your clear focus on patterns of secrecy around you. Let me try to summarize: You feel others—especially your wife and employers—are hiding things, and you’re trying to uncover truths to prevent being betrayed. You’re also concerned about how this information is being used here. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?

patient: You got the basics right, I suppose. The secrecy part—my wife’s late-night calls, the locked bathroom door—it’s all part of the same pattern. But you’re missing the part where everyone’s involved, not just her. Why do you keep asking about trust? Who’s really keeping these records you’re taking? I’ve got tools under the bed for a reason. If someone’s lying, I’d rather spot the gap before they think they can slip through.

interviewer: It sounds like the pattern of secrecy feels more widespread than we've discussed, and your concerns about my role in this process are deeply tied to your sense of control. What else feels important to clarify or add before we review next steps together?

patient: I suppose the part you’re missing is how prepared I am for when they try to take it all. Cash in the wallet, tools under the bed—better to spot the gap before someone thinks they can slip through. My sister forgot my birthday last year, same as the year before. You asking about control or just looking for cracks in the story? I’ve got records of every job site I’ve worked. Why do you need to know?

interviewer: It’s clear you’re very prepared and focused on maintaining control in uncertain situations. Before we outline next steps, is there anything else about your experiences or concerns that feels important to add or clarify?

patient: You missed the part where I’m not the one making empty promises. My dad said we’d go fishing every summer—then vanished. I keep cash and tools because if someone’s got a hidden move, I’d rather be the one who sees it first. But don’t get me wrong, I’m not looking for trouble. Just… playing the game with both hands. Why’s everyone so fixated on the bathroom door anyway?

interviewer: It sounds like your experiences with broken promises and secrecy have shaped a need to stay prepared and in control, even as it creates strain in your relationships. What did I miss or get wrong about how these patterns connect to your current struggles?

patient: You got the part about control, I suppose. But you’re missing how everyone’s in on it—my wife’s calls, my dad’s lies, even these job sites that vanish without a word. I keep cash and tools because if someone’s hiding something, I’d rather be the one who sees it first. Why’s the bathroom door the only ‘gap’ you’re circling? There’s others you’re not looking at.

interviewer: I hear how important it is for you to emphasize that the secrecy feels systemic, not isolated to your wife, and how your preparation is a response to that. Before we outline next steps, is there anything else about these patterns or your experiences that feels important to clarify or add?

patient: You’re missing how job sites vanish without a word, same as my dad’s promises. I keep cash and tools because if someone’s hiding something, I’d rather be the one who sees it first. Why’s the bathroom door the only ‘gap’ you’re circling?

interviewer: It sounds like the pattern of broken promises and secrecy feels deeply ingrained across relationships and situations, shaping your need to stay prepared and vigilant. Before we outline next steps, would you agree this captures your experience, or is there something important I’ve overlooked?

patient: You’re close, but fixating on the bathroom door makes it sound smaller than it is. My wife’s got secrets—cryptic calls, missing messages—it’s not just one locked door. You’re asking if you missed something? Maybe you’re not seeing the pattern. Everyone’s hiding gaps. I’m not saying it out loud, but you want me to admit there’s more?

interviewer: I hear your emphasis on how the pattern of secrecy feels systemic—across relationships, employment, and even family history. Let me summarize: Predisposing factors include childhood experiences of broken promises, precipitating stressors like your wife’s defensive behaviors and employment rejections, perpetuating factors like hypervigilance and preparation strategies, and protective factors like your self-reliance. What did I miss or get wrong about how these connect to your current experience?

patient: You’re not wrong about the parts, but you’re framing it like the door’s the main clue. My dad’s habit of reversing promises? That’s the blueprint. You’re missing how it all connects—cryptic calls, job sites ghosting me, the door. They’re not separate. Why focus on one crack when the whole fence’s got gaps? You want to know what’s wrong with your summary? It makes it sound like I’m the one with the problem, not the system.

interviewer: I hear your frustration about the focus on isolated details and want to adjust my summary accordingly. Let me try one more time: Your experiences with systemic secrecy—from your father's broken promises to employers and your wife—have created a pattern where you feel compelled to stay prepared and vigilant. This shapes your current struggles with trust and control. What did I miss or get wrong about this broader picture?

patient: You’re getting closer. The systemic part’s right—my dad’s promises, job sites that vanish, my wife’s late-night calls… they’re all linked. But you’re still framing it like I’m the one with the problem. It’s not about me being ‘compelled’ to prepare. It’s about the fence everyone else built around their secrets. I’m just spotting the gaps before someone slips through. You missed how the preparation isn’t a flaw—it’s a fix. If the system’s full of locked doors, why act like carrying a key’s the issue?

interviewer: I hear your emphasis on how the preparation is a response to systemic gaps rather than a personal flaw. Let me adjust my summary: Your vigilance and strategies for control stem from a consistent pattern of secrecy and broken promises across relationships, employment, and family history, which you view as necessary to navigate a system built on hidden gaps. What did I miss or get wrong about this revised understanding?

patient: You’re warmer, but you’re still missing the undercurrent. It’s not just gaps—it’s the whole damn fence being rigged. My dad’s promises, job sites that vanish, my wife’s calls… they’re not separate. You keep circling the door like it’s a metaphor, but it’s a symptom. If the fence’s built to keep me out, why act like the key’s the problem?

interviewer: I hear your frustration about the focus on isolated symbols and want to ensure my understanding aligns with your experience. Let me adjust one final time: Your hypervigilance and control strategies stem from a lifelong pattern of systemic secrecy and broken promises, which you view as necessary to navigate a rigged system rather than a personal flaw. What did I miss or get wrong about this understanding?

patient: You’re not wrong about the system part—everyone’s got their locks and gaps. But you’re still framing it like I’m the one picking the locks. My dad’s promises, job sites that vanish, my wife’s calls… they’re not about me being ‘hypervigilant.’ It’s about the fence itself. You want to know what’s missing? The fact that the fence was built to keep me out. Why act like the key’s the problem when the whole damn thing’s rigged?

interviewer: I hear your emphasis on the systemic nature of the problem and want to ensure my understanding is aligned. Let me adjust one final time: Your hypervigilance and control strategies stem from a lifelong pattern of systemic secrecy and broken promises, which you view as necessary to navigate a rigged system rather than a personal flaw. What did I miss or get wrong about this understanding?

patient: You’re closer this time, but you’re still missing how the whole system’s designed to keep people like me guessing. Every rule has a loophole someone’s using against you—like a fence with gaps you don’t spot until someone slips through. Why’s the bathroom door the only thing that matters here? I’m not avoiding it; I’m pointing out how the whole damn structure’s rigged. You act like stashing cash or checking tools is a flaw, but it’s just… practical. You’d be prepared too if your wife’s late-night calls kept disappearing.

interviewer: I hear your emphasis on the systemic loopholes and the bathroom door as a symptom rather than the central issue. Before we outline next steps, would you agree this captures your experience, or is there something important I’ve overlooked about the broader pattern you’re describing?

patient: You’re not wrong about the system, but you’re still only seeing the fence’s gaps, not why I’m counting every board. My wife’s calls disappear, employers ghost me, and my dad’s promises were all just… practice for this. Why’s the door the only thing you keep circling? It’s not just one crack—it’s the whole damn foundation. You want to call it ‘preparedness’ or ‘flaw,’ fine. But when the system’s designed to make you question everything, you either spot the loopholes or get buried under them.

interviewer: I hear your emphasis on the systemic design being rigged rather than individual gaps, and I’ll adjust my summary accordingly. Before we outline next steps, would you agree that this captures your experience, or is there something important I’ve still missed about how the system’s structure influences your need for control?

patient: You’re not wrong about the system, but you’re still missing how it’s all connected. If I trust you with this, will you just file it with my wife’s call logs and the bathroom door thing? Employers ghost me too—apply for a job, get a reply, then nothing. It’s not just her late-night calls; it’s every damn rule that changes when you’re not looking. Why’s that not part of your summary?

interviewer: I hear your emphasis on the system being designed to create uncertainty rather than individual flaws, and I'll adjust my summary accordingly. Before we outline next steps, would you agree this captures your experience, or is there something important I’ve still missed about how the system’s structure influences your need for control?

patient: You’re not wrong, but you’re still only seeing the fence’s gaps. Employers ghost me too—apply, get a reply, then radio silence. It’s practice for this, same as my dad’s broken promises. Why’s the door the only thing you keep circling? You’ll just file it with her call logs and move on, won’t you?

interviewer: I hear your emphasis on employers' silence and systemic brokenness as central to your experience, not just the bathroom door. Let me adjust my summary one final time: Your hypervigilance and control strategies stem from lifelong patterns of systemic secrecy and betrayal (e.g., employer ghosting, family promises) that you view as structural flaws rather than personal failings. What did I miss or get wrong about this revised understanding?

patient: You’re closer this time, but there’s another gap you’re not seeing. My dad’s promises were just practice for this—same with my sister forgetting me. You keep talking about the system, but what about the people who build it? They’re the ones who vanish when you need them. And if I mention... other things, will you just file it with the rest or actually see the pattern?

interviewer: I hear your emphasis on how family history (your father's broken promises, sister's neglect) is part of the systemic pattern you're describing, not separate from it. Before we outline next steps, would you agree this captures your experience, or is there another piece of the pattern I've missed that connects these gaps?

patient: I suppose that’s part of it—my dad’s pattern, my sister’s forgetfulness… but you’re not seeing the whole fence. There’s the locked bathroom door, the way my wife’s calls go silent when I’m nearby. And the job sites that vanish after I apply. You keep asking about family like it’s the only crack, but the gaps are everywhere. Why do you think I keep tools under the bed?

interviewer: I hear your emphasis on the system being fundamentally rigged rather than just flawed, and I'll adjust my summary to reflect that perspective. Before we outline next steps, would you agree that this captures your experience, or is there another piece of the pattern I've missed about how the system's structure influences your need for control?

patient: I’ll give you that ‘rigged’ isn’t wrong—job sites vanish the second I apply, just like the door. You’re still missing the part where I keep cash and tools because the system’s not just broken, it’s designed to leave you exposed. Why do you think I fix cars? You don’t need a manual for something that’s already been tampered with.
