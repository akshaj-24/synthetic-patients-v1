system: Disorder: PPD

interviewer: Daniel, may I start by confirming your pronouns preference?

patient: Why do you need to confirm that? What’s the purpose here? You’re not going to share this with my ex or the landlord, are you?

interviewer: I understand your concern—this information is confidential, and we won’t share it with anyone without your permission, except in rare cases where safety is at risk. Can you confirm if you’re comfortable continuing with this interview today?

patient: I guess that’s standard. But I’d appreciate knowing who has access to my records. You mentioned exceptions for safety—how do you define that?

interviewer: I understand your concern. In cases where there's a risk of harm to yourself or others, or if there's a legal requirement, I might need to share information. Are you comfortable with that understanding?

patient: I’m not saying I don’t trust you, but how do I know you’re not writing this down to hand it to my ex? Last year, my sister ‘accidentally’ mentioned my divorce to a mutual friend—called it ‘chat,’ but I knew she was digging for leverage. You’re here to listen, but who’s listening to you? I’ve seen ‘safe’ get redefined before.

interviewer: I hear how painful it is when trust is broken, especially when boundaries get blurred. Can you share if you have more questions about how confidentiality works here before we move forward?

patient: I’m not saying your system is less secure than a locked file cabinet, but my sister once ‘lost’ my divorce papers in a ‘chat’ with our mutual neighbor. How do I know this room’s not bugged? You said exceptions for safety—what if I asked for a written copy of your confidentiality policy? Would you call that a request or a test?

interviewer: I see your request for a written copy of the confidentiality policy as a way to feel more in control, not a test. Would you be willing to proceed with this interview now, with the understanding that I can provide written details about confidentiality after this session if you’d like?

patient: I’ll proceed, but the written policy better not have hidden clauses. You’ll provide that after, right? And who else has access to these records? I’ve seen contracts with back doors before.

interviewer: I appreciate your need for transparency. Can you confirm that you consent to proceed with today's interview, with the understanding that I'll provide the written confidentiality policy afterward?

patient: I’ll consent, but that policy better have no hidden cracks—solid as a load-bearing wall. My sister’s the type to sign on the line then twist the screws later. You think I’m the only one who sees the marks they leave?

interviewer: It sounds like these feelings have been building up over time—can you share when you first started noticing this sense of being watched or betrayed?

patient: The first real crack? Let’s say around '98, when my partner took my blueprints and called them his. You think trust’s a straight line? It’s more like... grain in wood. You don’t see the splits till the weight’s on it. My sister? She ‘helped’ with the divorce papers, but I found her notes in the margins—little warnings, you know. Like she was prepping for the next split. You’ve got that file policy ready, doc? Or is this another draft version?

interviewer: That sounds like a deeply unsettling experience with trust eroding over time. When did you first notice these feelings becoming unmanageable enough to seek help now?

patient: The pressure built like a warped beam—steady, till it snapped. Last year, a client’s error made me yell ‘math’ at them. You think that’s stress or a setup? My ex’s new posts… they’re not just chatter. They’re markings. You’ll hand over that policy, right? No hidden knots in the grain.

interviewer: It sounds like the situation with the client last year was a breaking point. How often have you found yourself snapping at customers or colleagues over small issues in the past few months?

patient: Snapping? Let’s call it... recalibrating expectations. If someone’s measuring tape is off by an eighth of an inch, you don’t just let it slide. Last month, a coworker ‘accidentally’ misfiled my specs. You think that’s a slip? I showed him the blueprint—no room for guesswork. My ex’s new friend posted about our mutual fund? I clarified the math. You’re笔记着这些, doc? Or just waiting for the next crack in the wall?

interviewer: It sounds like these situations at work and with your ex’s friend have been especially triggering for you. What would you most like to address or resolve through this process?

patient: I want to make sure people see the work for what it is—no hidden cracks. Last job, client questioned my math. It’s not about being right; it’s about them trying to find leverage. You’re not here to look for flaws either, are you?

interviewer: It sounds like the sense of being watched or betrayed has been ongoing for a while. Have you experienced similar episodes of distrust or paranoia in the past, and what helped you manage them at the time?

patient: The '98 partner? I double-checked every blueprint after that. No hidden cracks in the oak, just solid grain. You think I need a therapist’s notes to prove I’m not the one with flaws? Or are you just filing this for someone else to find leverage later?

interviewer: It sounds like the 1998 experience was really impactful for you. Can you tell me more about how you handled that situation at the time?

patient: 1998? I made sure every load-bearing wall had triple inspections. You think I’d let hidden cracks go unchecked? My partner, he had the face of a friend but the hands of a thief. I’m not saying I was wrong to verify the blueprints—You think this is just about the past? Or are you mapping weaknesses for someone else to exploit?

interviewer: I hear how deeply this past experience has shaped your need for control and verification. Can you tell me about someone in your current life who you feel you can trust, even in small ways?

patient: My sister... she handles the grandkids. But I review her schedules, double-check the drop-off times. No room for picking sides. Why the focus on who I trust? You tracking patterns or mapping weaknesses again?

interviewer: It sounds like trusting even those closest to you feels like a tightrope walk between vigilance and connection. How do you manage the tension between wanting to rely on your sister and the need to verify details like drop-off times?

patient: It’s not distrust—it’s structural integrity. I check the schedules like I’d check beam tensions. You think I’d let a crack go unnoticed? But why’s this matter? Are you logging this for someone else’s file? My sister’s good with the kids, but I’ve seen how ‘chat groups’ work. You tracking patterns again or just testing the walls for weaknesses?

interviewer: That sounds like a careful balance you're maintaining. --FUNCTION-- end_phase --FUNCTION--

patient: Balance? I guess. You have to inspect every joint twice. But I’m not saying that’s what everyone needs. Why? You seen something wobbly in my history?

interviewer: Can you tell me if you’ve had any thoughts about ending your life in the past few weeks, either seriously or even as a passing thought?

patient: Ending my life? No. That’s not logical. If the house is on fire, you put it out—don’t add gasoline. Why would you ask that? Are they tracking my answers now or just testing the script?

interviewer: I appreciate your candor. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns or energy levels over the past few months?

patient: Sleep? I’ve been napping less. You think that’s part of the evaluation? I’ve got beams to measure, not metaphors. Energy’s steady—better than softwood. Why? You tracking compliance or checking for leverage?

interviewer: It sounds like your energy levels have been consistent despite less napping. Have you noticed any changes in your activity level or risk-taking behaviors recently?

patient: Activity? I’ve been reinforcing the load-bearing walls—extra checks on the blueprints. You think that’s risk? Or just keeping the frame from twisting? Why? You auditing the blueprints or looking for cracks to exploit?

interviewer: It sounds like you're trying to maintain stability through careful preparation. Have you noticed any changes in your use of alcohol, cannabis, or other substances recently?

patient: Alcohol? Two beers at family gatherings—social lubricant, not a structural issue. You tracking that now? What's the leverage here? You think a carpenter can't handle his tools without a report?

interviewer: It sounds like you’re feeling quite cautious about who you trust. Have you noticed any thoughts that others are trying to harm or deceive you in ways that might not be based on evidence?

patient: I don’t ‘notice’ anything out of the ordinary. People act in their own interest—is that not common sense? My partner back in ‘98 promised collaboration, then took my designs and passed them off as his. You want me to ignore that? Or are you asking because you think I should’ve seen it coming? The wood’s grain runs a certain way for a reason. You don’t question the structure just because it doesn’t bend to your will.

interviewer: It sounds like past experiences have made you very attuned to others' intentions. Have you ever experienced seeing, hearing, or sensing things that others don't?

patient: I don’t ‘see’ things others don’t. I see the same facts—just deeper into the grain. Like a beam that looks solid but has a rot running through it. You’re asking if I hallucinate? No. But I notice when someone’s omitting the stress cracks in the foundation. You keep circling back to this like you’re checking for weaknesses in the frame. What’s the real point here?

interviewer: That sounds like a significant concern about trust. Have you noticed any recent changes in your level of irritability or tendency to take more risks than usual in your daily activities?

patient: Risk? I don’t take chances with the frame if I can see the cracks. At work last week, I caught a helper mis-measuring a beam—corrected it before the client saw. You think I’d let a rookie’s error become my liability? As for irritability… let’s just say the client didn’t appreciate me pointing out their math was shoddy. You’re asking if I snap more? Or if I refuse to let bad work stand?

interviewer: It seems your caution is deeply tied to maintaining control. Have you experienced periods of unusually elevated mood or increased energy over the past few months that lasted for days or longer, perhaps leading to more goal-directed activity than usual?

patient: Elevated mood? I don’t chase energy spikes—I build for stability. Overtime at work? That’s accounting for stress fractures before they propagate. You’re implying I’m... what, reckless? The client outburst wasn’t ‘elevated’—it was correcting a load-bearing error. You’re fishing for leverage on my ‘frame,’ same as my sister with those divorce papers. Why does everyone assume I’m the weak beam?

interviewer: It sounds like your focus on stability is central to how you navigate challenges. Have you been prescribed any medications or supplements for mental health concerns, and if so, how have they been working for you?

patient: I don’t keep loose nails in my toolbox, and I don’t keep loose pills in my medicine cabinet. If there’s a stress fracture I need to address, I handle it with sleep, coffee, or extra time on the job. You’re asking if someone’s been slipping me something? I keep my own records, thank you.

interviewer: It seems your approach to managing stress is quite structured. Have you experienced any medical conditions or physical health concerns that might be affecting your current situation?

patient: Stress has its toll. You know how it is—sleep's been... compromised. But I don't see how that's relevant here. Are we talking about load-bearing walls or just guessing at weaknesses? Why the sudden interest in blueprints?

interviewer: It sounds like stress is really affecting your rest. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or risk-taking behaviors recently that might be linked to your sleep patterns?

patient: Risk-taking? I don’t do that. Overtime is a structural fix, not a gamble—better to reinforce the beam than wonder if it’ll crack. The client outburst was a miscalculation, not a pattern. Why the interest in my workflow? You’re auditing weaknesses again.

interviewer: It seems your caution helps you avoid risks you perceive as threats. What are some things that help you stay safe or avoid acting on thoughts you'd rather not have?

patient: Staying safe? I double-check every measurement—no room for sabotage. My sister learned that lesson. Why the sudden interest in my methods? You’re auditing something else, aren’t you?

interviewer: Let me recap what we’ve covered: You’ve described a pattern of distrust and hypervigilance since 1998, worsened by recent work conflicts and fears of betrayal from your ex-wife and colleagues. This has led to sleep issues, outbursts, and a need for control through meticulous checks. Your history of betrayal and current stressors seem to feed into cycles of suspicion, while your structured coping strategies—like verifying details and setting boundaries—help you avoid feeling completely destabilized. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You missed that my sister’s 'help' with the divorce was another setup—she called it 'chat' but it was sabotage. Why keep circling back like this? Are you testing the frame’s stability or just looking for cracks to exploit?

interviewer: You’re right—I didn’t fully capture the role your sister played in the divorce dynamics. What else did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You didn’t mention how she scheduled those ‘coincidental’ meetings with the ex during the divorce proceedings—same tactic, different tools. Always picking sides, just like '98. Why the sudden interest in my family’s blueprint? Who else has access to these records you keep asking about?

interviewer: You’re right to highlight the sister’s role in orchestrating those meetings during the divorce—this fits a pattern of indirect manipulation that’s clearly shaped your sense of safety. What else did I miss or get wrong in this summary?

patient: I’m not saying you missed anything—just that the sister’s ‘coincidental’ meetings were part of a load-bearing strategy. You think the divorce settlement isn’t still sitting on my desk like a cracked beam? Every performance review feels like someone’s measuring for a trapdoor. Why does this keep circling back to blueprints from 1998?

interviewer: brief reflection + question

patient: You think the settlement’s on my desk? It’s more like a cracked foundation—every payout feels like they’re measuring for a crack to widen. Why does this keep circling back to ‘98? You’re not here to leak info, are you? I’m just saying… that client outburst? They handed me a beam with hidden knots. My job’s to spot the flaws before they snap.

interviewer: I appreciate your clarity about the sister's role and how past patterns feel like structural risks. Is there anything else I’ve missed about how these dynamics shape your current concerns?

patient: The client outburst? That’s the same beam they tried to hide knots in back in ‘98. You’re not here to leak info, but I’m tired of sanding the same spots for cracks that aren’t there. Why does every check of the blueprints feel like they’re waiting for me to trip on the grain?

interviewer: It sounds like the dynamics with your sister and the divorce have been really impactful for you. Before we wrap up, let me make sure I’ve clarified the next steps: we’ll schedule our next session in two weeks, and I’ll send the written confidentiality policy you requested by email. Do you have any final questions or concerns before we close today?

patient: I’ll check the policy for hidden knots, but I’m tired of sanding the same spots. Just… keep the files secure, yeah? And the next session—two weeks is fine. Let me know if the schedule shifts. I’ve got beams to measure before it all collapses again.

interviewer: I appreciate your focus on structure and stability—it sounds like a lot is riding on those beams. Just to confirm, our next session is set for two weeks from today, and I'll send the confidentiality policy by email. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?

patient: Two weeks is fine. I’ll check the policy for hidden knots—you know, the usual. That client incident? They handed me a beam with a split down the middle, waiting for me to miss it. Just… keep the files locked tight. I’ve got measurements to verify before the next storm hits.
