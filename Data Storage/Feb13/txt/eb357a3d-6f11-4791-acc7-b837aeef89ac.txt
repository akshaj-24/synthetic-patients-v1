system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that with me, Nicholas. I want to make sure we’re on the same page about how this session will work. Do you have any questions about what I’ll be asking or how this process works before we begin?

patient: I think the process is straightforward, you know? Just... talking through things. To be honest, I’m used to structured evaluations from work. I guess if there’s anything, it’s just—how much do you need to know about... personal stuff? I mean, I’m sure it’s all relevant, but sometimes details feel... overwhelming to unpack.

interviewer: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed by unpacking personal details. Are you comfortable proceeding with this process as we discussed?

patient: I—I guess so. As long as we can... take it step by step? You know, I just need to make sure nothing gets... oversimplified. I’m not great with ambiguity, really. But if structure helps, I can manage. I’ll manage.

interviewer: Can you tell me about the main concerns that have been on your mind lately?

patient: It’s like... my brain’s stuck on this hamster wheel of deadlines and what-ifs. Work’s been overwhelming—budgets, staff expectations, just... tiny details that feel like they could spiral if I blink. And then there’s everything else. You know? Family stuff. Finances. I guess I’m just... not sleeping well. It’s hard to explain, but I feel tired all the time, even after a full night’s sleep. I keep telling myself I can manage it, but...

interviewer: That sounds really challenging. When did you first start feeling this level of overwhelm?

patient: It’s hard to pinpoint an exact moment, but... I guess the pandemic was when it all started to... escalate? At first, it was just working from home while my mom’s health declined, and my dad’s financial messes. But it felt manageable, you know? Then the divorce finalized last year, and suddenly everything just... piled up. I kept telling myself I could handle it if I just planned better, but my brain won’t let me turn off the what-ifs. Even now, I’ll lie awake redoing budget numbers in my head, like if I fix the spreadsheet, everything else will somehow... stabilize.

interviewer: It sounds like your mind races with these worries even at night. How often do you find yourself redoing these budget numbers at night, and what does that look like for you?

patient: It’s... maybe five or six nights a week? I’ll lie there mentally recalculating figures, you know, just to ‘double-check’ even though the reports are due in the morning. My hands used to shake so bad I’d wake up my roommate—now it’s just me and the dog staring at the ceiling. I tell myself it’s caffeine or stress, but... the numbers never add up the same way twice. (Pulses fingers on knees.) It’s not even about the work. It’s like my brain’s proving I can’t trust myself with anything.

interviewer: It sounds like the need to double-check everything is tied to a deeper fear of not being able to trust yourself. When did you first notice this pattern of doubting yourself in ways that go beyond work responsibilities?

patient: I—I think it’s always been there, you know? My mom was a principal, and she’d mark my report cards in red ink. It’s like… my brain learned to second-guess everything before anyone else could. But it’s worse now. (Fingers pulse against his thighs.) The divorce… it’s not just the numbers or work. Sometimes I’ll forget if I locked the door or if the dog got fed, and my hands start shaking. I tell myself it’s exhaustion, but…

interviewer: That sounds really isolating. How has the divorce specifically affected your ability to manage daily tasks or routines since it finalized last year?

patient: It’s... complicated. The dog’s custody meant I have to track his vet appointments and meds, which I used to delegate, but now I second-guess every dosage. (Fingers tap nervously.) And the alimony—my ex handles the legal stuff, but I’ll lie awake calculating if I’m ‘saving enough’ for emergencies. (Pauses, then softer.) Last week I forgot if I’d paid the electric bill or not. My hands started shaking so bad I had to call my sister just to confirm... even though she’s six time zones away. I tell myself it’s just adjusting, but...

interviewer: It sounds like these doubts and physical reactions are making daily tasks feel like a tightrope walk. What would you hope to achieve by coming in for help with these challenges?

patient: I guess... I want to stop feeling like I’m one mistake away from everything falling apart. (Adjusts glasses, fingers trembling slightly.) The dog’s vet bills, the alimony, even the grocery list—it’s all just proof I’m waiting to ‘mess up.’ If I could just... trust that I’m not a disaster, maybe the shaking would stop. But I don’t know. Maybe I’m just asking for a way to work 12 hours a day without my hands turning into Jell-O. (Forces a tight smile.) My boss keeps saying I’m ‘overprepared,’ but I’d rather have extra spreadsheets than let anyone down.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been managing a lot of complex challenges methodically, even when it's difficult. Have you experienced periods in the past where similar worries or physical symptoms became overwhelming, and if so, what helped you through those times?

patient: I guess... during the pandemic, when my mom was first diagnosed, I just buried myself in work. Like, 14-hour days. It helped, maybe? For a while. But then the shaking started—my hands would tremble so bad I’d drop my coffee. I told myself it was ‘adrenaline’ or ‘lack of sleep.’ (Pauses, adjusts glasses.) Eventually, I had to take a week off. My sister sent me these meditation apps. I... I deleted them after a day. They felt like a waste of time. (Soft chuckle.) Now, I just keep making sourdough loaves that collapse. At least the dog doesn’t judge the crumb structure.

interviewer: It sounds like the pandemic period was a significant challenge for you. Have you experienced other times in your life where similar patterns of working excessively and physical symptoms emerged, and if so, what strategies helped you at those times?

patient: I think I mentioned the whole pandemic thing already? It’s like... my default setting now. Before that, trying to juggle my parents’ messes while working—my mom’s health stuff, my dad’s money disasters. I’d work 12-hour days just to feel like I wasn’t failing at everything. The shaking started then too, but I told myself it was ‘just stress.’ As for strategies? Forcing myself into routines—like my coffee-and-walk thing—helps... sometimes. But it’s easier to over-explain spreadsheets than admit I’m drowning.

interviewer: It sounds like maintaining routines is a way you try to regain control when things feel overwhelming. Who have you found yourself relying on the most during especially stressful periods, and how have they supported you?

patient: I guess... my sister, Clara? She’s abroad, though, so it’s just quick calls. I don’t really talk about the heavy stuff—she’s got her own life. And work? There’s... a coworker I grab lunch with sometimes. We debate soccer tactics. It’s normal, you know? Keeps me from thinking about spreadsheets. But honestly? Routines are easier. If I mess up a coffee ritual, that’s a ‘small win’ I can control. Asking someone for help? Feels like admitting I’m the problem.

interviewer: I want to start by checking in about your safety. Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life?

patient: No, I... I haven’t. But there are nights where it feels like life’s a sinking ship and I’m just bailing water. I hate that part—the exhaustion of fighting the same current. My morning routine helps ground me, even if it’s just the coffee ritual. The shaking in my hands... it’s worse then, but I tell myself that if I can track ‘small wins,’ I’m not completely drowning.

interviewer: It sounds like your morning routine is a meaningful anchor for you amidst the overwhelm. Have you noticed any other medical conditions or physical symptoms that might be contributing to your current stress or anxiety?

patient: I guess... my sleep’s been worse lately. Even with the morning routine, I lie awake redoing budget numbers in my head. And my shoulders... they feel like they’re made of concrete most days. I just chalk it up to sitting too long, you know? The doctor last year said it was ‘stress-related,’ which... yeah. But if I can just perfect the spreadsheet, maybe everything else will catch up.

interviewer: I want to check in about substances—have you used alcohol or cannabis in the past month, and if so, how often?

patient: I guess... maybe once or twice at work events? Just two beers, you know, to 'calm the nerves.' But it doesn’t really help, and my head feels worse the next day. Honestly, I’d rather stick to my coffee routine—it’s less... messy. I’m not sure why I even mentioned it.

interviewer: It sounds like the alcohol use feels more like an attempt to cope than a helpful routine. Have you used cannabis or other substances like prescription medications or stimulants in the past month?

patient: No, nothing else. I guess I’m not really into... you know, experimenting with that. The beer thing is just, like, situational. It’s not like it actually calms anything down, though. I just... it’s not worth getting into. My brain’s already on overload.

interviewer: It sounds like the alcohol use feels disconnected from genuine relief. Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed less sleep recently, even while feeling stressed?

patient: No, not really. I mean, sometimes I feel like I have to keep going even when I’m exhausted, but that’s just work, right? My brain’s on a hamster wheel anyway. I guess... maybe when I’m stressed, I just... snap at people? My hands get shaky, but I tell myself it’s caffeine or sleep deprivation. You know how it is.

interviewer: It sounds like your stress has been manifesting in both physical and emotional ways. Have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or strong paranoid thoughts that others don’t seem to share?

patient: No, nothing like that. I mean... sometimes I catch myself double-checking emails or wondering if people are talking about me, but that’s just... work stuff, right? My brain’s already on overload. I guess if anything, I’m just hyper-vigilant about, like, budget numbers or deadlines. You know how it is when you’re trying to hold things together.

interviewer: It sounds like work-related pressures are a major source of your vigilance. Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed less sleep recently, even while feeling stressed?

patient: No, nothing like that. I mean... sometimes I feel like I have to keep going even when I’m exhausted, but that’s just work, right? My brain’s on a hamster wheel anyway. I guess... maybe when I’m stressed, I just... snap at people? My hands get shaky, but I tell myself it’s caffeine or sleep deprivation. You know how it is when you’re trying to hold things together.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to perform and control outcomes. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including over-the-counter ones, for anxiety, sleep, or other symptoms?

patient: No medications, just... melatonin sometimes. It’s not like it actually helps, though. I guess I try to convince myself it’s a ‘bandage’ for the sleep thing. My sister swears by chamomile tea, but I just... can’t wrap my head around herbal stuff, you know? It’s all just placeholders until I get the spreadsheets under control.

interviewer: It sounds like your attempts to manage stress through routine and spreadsheets are central to your coping. Have you noticed any medical conditions like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, or chronic pain that might be contributing to your symptoms or affecting your energy and focus?

patient: I guess I’ve had the blood tests—everything was normal. The doctor said it’s just stress. I mean, the shaking… I think it’s the coffee and sleepless nights. I’m not sure it’s anything else.

interviewer: Based on our conversation, it sounds like chronic anxiety, perfectionism, and work-family stressors have been central to your experience, with symptoms like racing thoughts, physical tension, and sleep issues worsening since the pandemic and your divorce. I’d tentatively frame this as a mix of predisposing factors (like childhood self-doubt), precipitating stressors (divorce, family health), perpetuating patterns (perfectionism, avoidance), and some protective factors (structured routines, work support). What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: I guess you didn’t mention how the stress feels… cyclical. Like, fixing the spreadsheets at work should help, but then my dad’s medication costs or the dog’s vet bills just replace it. You know? It’s like bailing water but the ship’s sinking slower. And maybe… the soccer guy’s lunch chats? They’re the only thing that feels normal. But I’m not sure any of that matters.

interviewer: It sounds like the soccer guy’s lunch chats are a small but meaningful anchor for you amid all this chaos. Let me check if I’ve captured everything—what else feels important to add before we discuss next steps?

patient: The morning routine—it’s almost like a… a ritual, you know? Brew the pour-over just right, walk the same path by the river, track 'small wins' in a spreadsheet. But I end up hating myself for 'wasting time' on it. And the sourdough—ugh, every loaf collapses, but I keep trying. It’s stupid, but it feels like if I can just master that, maybe everything else will… fall into place.
