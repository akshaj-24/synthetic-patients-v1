system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Sean. It sounds like this has been a really challenging time for you. Just to clarify, are you comfortable with me asking some questions to better understand what you're experiencing and how I might support you today?

patient: Sure, I guess. It’s not like I have a manual for this, but yeah—ask away. I’ll... try to make sense of it. My brain’s been running on battery power since the 90s, but we can start somewhere. Just don’t mind the check-engine light in my car; it’s been on for weeks. Small problems, right?

interviewer: That sounds really tough to manage day by day. Do you have any questions about how today’s conversation will go before we begin?

patient: Honestly? I’m more confused about the process than anything. Like… is this like organizing discovery? You ask questions, I answer them, and we both pretend I’m not sleep-deprived? My only real question is if you need me to stop talking about the check-engine light. It’s been on for weeks, but I guess that’s just part of the ‘small problems’ package. I’ll power through, though. Always do.

interviewer: That’s a fair comparison—can I clarify that today’s conversation will focus on understanding what you’re experiencing so we can work together on next steps? Does that sound like a helpful way to start?

patient: Yeah, that sounds... methodical. Like organizing discovery. I mean, I’ve spent enough hours in depositions to know that asking the right questions is half the battle. Just don’t expect me to spill the whole case at once—I’m still figuring out which details matter. Oh, and the check-engine light’s still blinking. Probably just needs a reset. Or a new battery. Or a therapist. We’ll see what diagnostics reveal.

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about the process—can you clarify if there's anything else about how we'll structure this conversation that feels unclear or concerning before we move forward?

patient: I think we’re on the same page—no need to overcomplicate the discovery process here. Just… don’t expect me to pivot to emotional depositions without warning. My brain’s been running on battery power since the 90s, but I’ll stick to the facts. Oh, and the check-engine light’s still blinking. Small problems, right?

interviewer: I appreciate your honesty about the process—can you confirm that you're comfortable proceeding with this conversation as we've discussed?

patient: Sure, I mean... it's not like we're doing discovery without a checklist. (laughs) As long as we're not going off-script, I can manage. Though my car's been acting up again—check-engine light's been on for weeks. You'd think it could wait, but no, it's another damn thing to troubleshoot.

interviewer: Can you tell me more about what's been bringing you the most distress lately?

patient: The check-engine light, honestly? It’s this... constant low-battery warning, but for everything. I guess I’m just tired of feeling like my whole life is a series of things that need troubleshooting. Work’s been a mess—missed a deadline last month, had to resubmit a landlord-tenant file. Not a big deal, just... inefficient. (pauses, softens) And sleep? I wake up at 3 a.m. most nights. My brain’s been running on battery power since the 90s, I swear. (attempts a wry smile) But I’ll fix the car. I always do.

interviewer: It sounds like the sleep disturbances and fatigue are really affecting your daily functioning. When did you first notice these issues starting?

patient: Six months, maybe? It crept in after that landlord-tenant case I messed up. I’d wake at 3, re-reading discovery notes like maybe I’d find some... efficiency I missed. (shrugs) Now it’s just this background noise, like my car’s check-engine light. You drive slower, but you don’t actually stop to fix anything.

interviewer: It sounds like this has been a challenging few months with work and sleep. What are you hoping to achieve through this therapy?

patient: I guess... I just want to stop feeling like my brain’s in discovery mode all the time. You know, sifting through the same files for efficiencies that aren’t there. (pauses, avoids eye contact) If I could sleep past 3 a.m. without checking the check-engine light, that’d be... a start. But I don’t want to overstate it. It’s just— (shrugs, forced humor) —I’d like to stop troubleshooting my own life before the battery dies completely.

interviewer: That sounds really exhausting... How has this sleep pattern been affecting your work performance or interactions with your wife lately?

patient: Work’s slower, sure. I catch myself double-checking case citations like they’ll absolve me for being... inefficient. (shrugs) My wife’s been asking if I want to eat dinner together, but I just say ‘paperwork’ and bury myself in it. I guess I snap at her sometimes—last week I called her ‘distracting’ when she brought up our anniversary. (forced chuckle) She deserves better than a guy who’s troubleshooting his own marriage like it’s a discovery motion.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of guilt about how you've been responding to your wife. How have you been managing those feelings of guilt or frustration when they come up?

patient: Honestly? I guess I... I channel it into fixing things. Like my car's check-engine light—been on for months, but I keep thinking if I just figure it out, everything else will make sense. Work helps too. I'll stay late at the office, organize files alphabetically... it's stupid, but it makes me feel like I'm not failing at *something*. My wife says I'm avoiding, but... maybe she's right. I just hate that I can't even be present for the things that matter. Like, I called her 'distracting' the other day. Can you believe that? Pathetic.

interviewer: It sounds like the strain of troubleshooting these issues has been building up. Have you experienced episodes like this before, where you felt persistently down, fatigued, and struggled with motivation or sleep?

patient: I... I don’t know if this is ‘the same thing.’ I’ve had busy periods before—law’s a grind, you know? But this feels different. Like the battery analogy I mentioned earlier, except... the battery’s not just low. It’s been *drained*. I used to push through stress by working harder, but now even that feels like a chore. The insomnia? That’s new. And the weight loss... my wife keeps saying I look like I haven’t slept in a week. I just tell her I’m ‘figuring things out.’ But maybe I’m not.

interviewer: That sounds like a significant shift from your usual work-related stress. Have you experienced similar episodes in the past where you felt this drained or disconnected?

patient: No, not exactly. I’ve had rough patches—long cases, tight deadlines. But this... this feels like the first time I can’t just power through. Like my system’s crashed, but there’s no reset button. I’m just... stuck in maintenance mode.

interviewer: That sense of being 'stuck in maintenance mode' sounds really isolating, especially when you're used to problem-solving your way through challenges. Have there been times in the past when you experienced similar feelings of being overwhelmed, even if briefly, and if so, what helped you regain momentum then?

patient: I guess... in the past, deadlines used to act like a reset. Like, if I had a trial coming up, the structure forced me to focus. But that was a 'fix' with clear parameters—this? It’s like the check-engine light keeps flashing codes I don’t know how to read. I can’t even remember the last time I felt that 'oh, okay, this has a solution' kind of stress. Maybe that’s why I’m still stuck in... maintenance mode. But that’s probably not what you’re looking for.

interviewer: It sounds like the lack of clear solutions is adding to the frustration. Can you share more about what specific stressors in your current life might be contributing to this sense of being stuck?

patient: I guess... the usual suspects, you know? Work deadlines, keeping up with the car’s endless repairs—like the check-engine light that’s been on for months. I keep thinking if I just tackle those, everything else will... fall into place. But then there’s stuff I don’t even know how to fix. My mom’s health, for example. She’s... declining, and I haven’t even told my wife yet. It feels like another thing I’m failing at. But maybe that’s just me overcomplicating it.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life or self-harming in the past few months?

patient: I guess... sometimes I think about not waking up. It’s not like I’d plan anything, though. Just... nights where I wonder if the car’s check-engine light would just stay quiet forever. But I don’t know. Maybe that’s just tiredness talking.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to carry alone. How often have you been having these thoughts about not wanting to wake up?

patient: Maybe a few times a month. Usually when I’m stuck in traffic or the check-engine light’s blinking. I guess it’s just… tiredness, right? My brain’s a bit of a downer lately, but I’m not suicidal. Just… low battery, if that makes sense.

interviewer: That sounds really tough to carry. Have there been specific situations or triggers that make these thoughts of not wanting to wake up feel stronger for you?

patient: It’s… when things pile up. Like if I miss a filing deadline or my mom’s doctor calls about her memory—stuff I can’t just fix by working harder. The check-engine light feels like a metaphor sometimes. But I guess it’s just stress. I don’t like admitting that, though. Sounds like I’m making excuses.

interviewer: It sounds like these stressors are adding up in a way that feels unmanageable. Have you ever had a specific plan or thoughts about how you might try to make those 'not wanting to wake up' feelings go away?

patient: No, I don’t have a plan. It’s more like… I just try not to think about it. Like ignoring the check-engine light until it goes away on its own. But that’s probably just me being in denial. I’d rather focus on work—or at least pretend I can control something.

interviewer: It sounds like work is a way to distract yourself from feeling overwhelmed. Have you been using alcohol or other substances more than usual lately to help with stress or sleep?

patient: I don’t drink much—maybe a glass of wine偶尔, but nothing serious. I’ve stuck to coffee and white noise apps instead. Though… I did start drinking more black coffee after the check-engine light came on. Guess I’m just looking for any ‘system reset’ button, even if it’s just another caffeine crash.

interviewer: It sounds like you're relying on coffee to keep going. Have you used any other substances, like cannabis, stimulants, or opioids, either recreationally or for medical reasons?

patient: No, just coffee. I guess you could say it’s my... legal stimulant. Keeps the gears turning, even if the engine’s a bit tired. The car’s check-engine light’s been on for weeks, but at least it’s not asking for anything else.

interviewer: It sounds like coffee is the main substance you're relying on right now. Have you been taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements regularly—either for your energy levels, sleep, or anything else?

patient: No medications, just a multivitamin I probably don’t even need. My pharmacist keeps suggesting something for sleep, but I tell her I’m not a ‘z-drug’ kind of guy. Though… I did start taking melatonin once. Wait, no—actually, I forget if I bought it or just stared at the bottle. My brain’s like a sealed exhibit these days: labeled but not opened.

interviewer: It sounds like your brain’s been in a bit of a holding pattern lately. Have you noticed any other medical issues that might be contributing to your fatigue or sleep troubles, like thyroid problems, sleep apnea, or chronic pain?

patient: No, I haven’t had anything diagnosed medically—just the usual suspects: stress, maybe a touch of... I don’t know, 'work addiction'? Though my wife would call it something less polite. The weight loss? That’s just me getting better at packing light for chaos. Metaphorically.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been managing a lot through humor and work. Have you experienced any hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thoughts lately—like seeing or hearing things others don't, or believing something unusual is happening to you?

patient: No, nothing like that. I mean, sometimes I wonder if the car’s check-engine light is some kind of metaphor for my brain… but that’s just me overthinking. I guess stress makes me paranoid, like I’m about to miss a deadline or say something stupid. But it’s all in my head—no ghosts, just… a leaky pipe, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like stress is really affecting your thoughts and energy. Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed less sleep, even if it wasn't restful?

patient: No, I’ve just… been running on fumes, I guess. Like the car’s check-engine light—ignoring it until the battery dies. I’ll work late, but it’s not energy, really. Just… pretending the manual says ‘ignore all warnings.’

interviewer: From what you’ve shared, it sounds like you’ve been struggling with a mix of persistent low mood, fatigue, and insomnia for several months, which has affected your work performance and relationships. You’ve described feeling overwhelmed by unresolved stressors—like your mother’s health and work deadlines—and using humor or technical metaphors to cope. There’s also some guilt about withdrawing from your wife and passive thoughts about not wanting to wake up, though you don’t have a plan right now. What did I miss or get wrong here?

patient: You... you got a lot right. The car metaphor’s just my brain’s way of not talking about the rest of it, I guess. The check-engine light thing? It’s annoying, but I’ll figure it out. The guilt with my wife—yeah, I’ve been a jerk, but I’m not great at fixing that part. Everything else? I’m just... tired. Not dramatic, just tired.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. To help keep things on track, can you share what steps you might take if you notice those passive thoughts about not wanting to wake up becoming more frequent or intense?

patient: I guess I’d... force myself to stay on task? Like, if the thoughts get worse, I’ll just power through with more coffee and paperwork. Maybe call my wife, but I’d probably wait until I had a ‘solution’ ready—doesn’t make sense to bother her with more mess. Honestly, I’m just used to fixing things. If it gets really bad? I’ll... I’ll look up DIY car repair forums for the check-engine light. It’s just another problem to solve, right?

interviewer: It sounds like you're managing with work and coffee, but I want to make sure we have a plan in place. Can you share what steps you think would help you feel more supported moving forward?

patient: I guess... breaking tasks into smaller steps might help? Like, setting specific times for work instead of just working until it’s done. More coffee, maybe. And maybe... I don’t know, calling my wife when I’m not already in the middle of ‘fixing’ something. It’s just... easier to handle one problem at a time. The check-engine light can wait until I’m not already running on fumes, you know?

interviewer: It sounds like creating space to address one thing at a time—even small steps—might help ease the weight you’re carrying. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to clarify or discuss about what we’ve covered today?

patient: I guess... I’ll start with the check-engine light. It’s a concrete thing, you know? If I can just fix that, maybe the rest... makes more sense. Probably overthinking again.

interviewer: It’s good to hear you’re starting with something concrete. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to clarify about our discussion today or any final questions about next steps?

patient: No, I think that’s about it. Maybe just... double-checking the spice rack organization? Alphabetical order is a small win, right? And if the check-engine light still won’t stop blinking, I’ll... look into it. Eventually. Everything else feels like part of the same system, you know? You fix one wire, another bulb burns out. But I’m used to that.
