system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Allison. Can you tell me if you feel safe right now or if there's anything immediately concerning you that we should address before we begin?

patient: I guess... I’m safe, you know? Just tired, really. Nights are the worst—my mind won’t settle. I’ll lie there till 3, staring at the ceiling. Feels like punishment, but I tell myself I can’t afford to break down. My daughter needs me, even if I’m not... enough. The landlord’s been sending letters, and the boss said I’m slowing the crew down. I just keep telling myself, ‘Allison, you got to hold it together.’

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Are you comfortable continuing with the interview today?

patient: I guess so... It’s just hard to focus sometimes. My mind keeps going back to that washing machine. You know, the one in the laundromat? It’s been acting up again, and I’m worried about the extra cost. But if you think it’s best to keep going...

interviewer: That sounds really tough... It seems like the washing machine is adding to your stress. Do you have any questions about how this interview will go or anything else before we proceed?

patient: No, I guess not... Just hope I can keep up. My head’s all foggy, but I’ll try. The laundromat’s been a mess, but I’ll manage.

interviewer: It sounds like the weight of these feelings has been really overwhelming for you. Can you tell me more about when these thoughts of not wanting to be here first started for you?

patient: I guess... it started when things began breaking down, you know? The marriage was already shaky, but when he left, it felt like that washing machine in my old apartment—just kept whirring, then stopped. I had to handle everything alone: bills, the house, my daughter. The first few months after... I’d wake up at 3, couldn’t go back to sleep. Felt like I was stuck in neutral, but the world kept moving. I told myself it was just stress, but...

interviewer: It sounds like the stress of handling everything alone has really taken a toll on you. How have these symptoms changed or progressed since the divorce?

patient: It’s... hard to track, really. The nights, they just got longer after the divorce. I used to wake up at 3 a.m. and stare at the ceiling, but now it feels like the clock’s stuck. I guess my body just gave up fighting it. At work, I slow down more—my boss says I’m not keeping up, but I tell myself I’m just... being careful. The washer breaking down didn’t help. Hauling laundry to the laundromat? It’s like that machine’s mocking me, you know? Whirring and stopping, same as me.

interviewer: It sounds like the broken washing machine has added another layer of frustration to your already heavy load. Can you share how this added responsibility has affected your daily routine or stress levels?

patient: It’s like havin’ a second job, you know? Gotta wake up earlier to get there before the machines get booked... My legs feel like lead by the time I get home. I try to keep up, but...

interviewer: It sounds like the added strain of the laundromat is compounding your exhaustion. How have these challenges with the laundromat and fatigue affected your interactions with your daughter or other relationships?

patient: I guess... I just don’t have the energy to call as much as I should. She’s always sayin’ she’s busy, and I don’t want to bother her with all this laundry stuff. Plus, I figure she’s got her own life to worry about. Sometimes I try to text, but my hands are too tired to type right. I don’t want her thinkin’ I’m... I don’t know, a burden or nothin’.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of worry about how others might see you. What would you most hope could change for you through this process?

patient: I guess... if the fog would lift a little. You know, so I don’t slow nobody else down. Just... keep the machine runnin’ long enough to see another Monday.

interviewer: That sounds really hard, carrying so much alone. Have you experienced similar episodes of feeling this overwhelmed or hopeless in the past, and if so, what helped you back then?

patient: Not really... I mean, life’s always had its rough patches, right? Like when the kids were little and money was tight. I just kept my head down and worked harder. This time feels... heavier, like the weight’s on my chest longer. Maybe I didn’t know better before, but now? It’s like the machine’s broken and I can’t fix it.

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure of being a single parent is adding to your sense of being overwhelmed. Can you tell me a bit about your relationship with your daughter, and how you two have been connecting since the divorce?

patient: I guess... we’re both trying, but it’s like we’re speaking different languages now. She’s got her own life, and I don’t want to be a bother, so I just... I do the laundry, keep the place tidy, you know? Maybe that’s enough. To be honest, the laundromat’s been a mess lately—broken machines, extra trips—and I worry she’ll see the receipts and think I’m wasting money. I tell myself if I just hold on, things’ll... click back into place. Like the washing machine.

interviewer: It sounds like maintaining your connection with your daughter is important to you. Are there other people in your life you can talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed, or any activities that help you feel grounded?

patient: Not really... I guess there's the church folk, but we just swap stories over coffee. Don’t want to weigh nobody down with my mess. Sometimes I’ll listen to that old R&B while I vacuum—keeps my hands busy, I guess. But most days... I just focus on the mop bucket, making sure the handle’s just so. It’s the only thing that don’t feel like it’s falling apart.

interviewer: It sounds like the routine of cleaning gives you a sense of control. Are there other activities or habits that help you feel more grounded when everything else feels overwhelming?

patient: Sewing used to... it used to do something for me. Now the thread just tangles, like my thoughts. Sometimes I’ll sit and hum along to the radio, but it’s not the same. The only thing that feels... solid is making sure the cleaning logs are all checked off. If I can just keep that straight, maybe nothing else will slip through.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying a lot of emotional weight lately. Have you been having thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life recently?

patient: I... I don’t think about it like that. It’s more like the fog, y’know? Sometimes I just hope it lifts before I have to do another load at the laundromat. But if I focus on folding the sheets right, it... it keeps me going. For my daughter, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like the fog is a heavy burden to carry. Have you had any specific thoughts about how you might harm yourself, even if just in passing?

patient: I don’t... I don’t think about it like that. It’s more like the fog just gets thicker sometimes, y’know? Like the machine’s stuck in spin cycle and you can’t reach the off button. But I keep checking the cleaning logs, making sure they’re all signed off... if I can hold that straight, maybe the rest don’t matter. I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like the fog is really overwhelming for you. Have you had any thoughts about a specific way you might harm yourself, even if you don’t plan to follow through?

patient: I guess... sometimes I think about not waking up. Like the washing machine—sometimes you just keep going until it stops. But I don’t... plan it, y’know? It’s just the way I feel when I’m at the laundromat, waiting for the cycles to finish. Like, maybe if I just let myself rest, it’d all be over. But I don’t really think about *how*.

interviewer: It sounds like the thought of not waking up is something that weighs on you, even if it's not something you plan to act on. Have you ever felt that not waking up is something you might actually want to happen, even if just for a moment?

patient: I... I don’t know. It’s not like I *want* it, but some nights at the laundromat, when the machines are just... humming and my eyes keep closing, I guess I wonder what it’d be like. But then I think about folding the sheets right, y’know? If I don’t do it perfect, my daughter might see them and think... I’m not trying. So I just... keep going.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy responsibility for your daughter, even when it's hard. Have you thought about any specific way you might consider harming yourself if things feel unmanageable?

patient: I don’t... think about it like that. It’s not like I sit there and figure out *how*. It’s more like... the laundromat machines, y’know? You just keep going until the cycle’s done. My daughter—she’s all I got left. Even if I’m wrecked, I can’t let the sheets stay wrinkled. It’s not... it’s not that simple, but I guess it’s not that either.

interviewer: It sounds like your daughter gives you a strong sense of purpose even when things feel overwhelming. Have you noticed any changes in your alcohol or drug use lately?

patient: I... I don’t really drink much. Maybe a glass of wine sometimes at church events, but that’s it. It’s not like I’m... you know... doing anything bad. Just... trying to keep my head above water. My daughter needs me to stay... steady.

interviewer: It sounds like you're prioritizing stability for your daughter even through challenging times. Have you been using any other substances, like cannabis, stimulants, or opioids, either recreationally or medicinally?

patient: No, ma’am. Just that wine now and then at church. I can’t afford no other... distractions. My doctor gave me some pills for my back, but they’re for moving, not thinking. I guess I just... focus on the laundry. If I add anything else, the machine might overflow, y’know?

interviewer: It sounds like the thought of not waking up is something that weighs on you deeply. Have you thought about how you might actually harm yourself if things feel unmanageable, even in a general way?

patient: I guess... sometimes I think about it like the washing machine. You know, how it just... stops. But it's not like I'm planning anything. It's more like hoping the cycle ends, y'know? The laundromat line's long enough already without adding more weights. I try not to let my daughter see the wrinkles, but some days the machine just... doesn't spin right.

interviewer: It sounds like hoping the cycle ends feels like a heavy weight to carry. Have you ever thought about a specific way you might consider harming yourself, even if just in general?

patient: I don’t think about specifics... It’s more like... the weight of it all. I just... I don’t want to think about how it would work. My daughter... she’d hate herself if she knew. The pills the doctor gave me? They just make me sleep, but that’s not... that’s not the same as it ending. The machine just... it keeps spinning until it don’t anymore.

interviewer: It’s hard to carry that weight alone. Have you ever tried to harm yourself or attempted suicide in the past?

patient: No... I haven’t. Not really. It’s more like... the weight of the machine just keeps spinning. I guess I freeze up, y’know? The pills the doctor gave me—they make me sleep, but that’s not the same as... as letting go. I just... can’t picture it. My daughter... she’s all I got left. But some nights, the spin cycle feels like it’ll never stop.

interviewer: I hear how the weight of everything feels impossible to lift right now. Can you tell me about the medications you’re currently taking, including the ones prescribed by your doctor?

patient: I guess... there’s these pills the doctor gave me. They just make me sleep, y’know? Not really sure if they’re helping with anything else. I mean, sleeping’s good, but... it’s like the machine just runs longer before it stops. I don’t wanna talk too much ‘bout ‘em, really. My daughter’s texts still in my bag. I should answer ‘em, but some days... the laundromat line’s long enough already.

interviewer: I hear how the medications feel like they're only prolonging the cycle rather than bringing relief. Can you tell me the name of the pills your doctor prescribed, how often you're taking them, and if there are any side effects besides making you sleep?

patient: They’re just the blue ones the doctor gave me. Take ‘em every day. Make me sleepy, but that’s about it. I guess I just... focus on getting through the laundromat line so I don’t think too much. My daughter’s texts still in my bag. Should answer ‘em, but some days... the machine just spins longer.

interviewer: I hear how the medication feels like it's only prolonging the cycle rather than bringing relief. Can you tell me the name of the pills your doctor prescribed, how often you're taking them, and if there are any side effects besides making you sleep?

patient: They’re blue pills, take ’em at night. Doctor says they’re for sleep, but... they just make me tired. I guess that’s it. My daughter’s been asking about the laundromat bills. You know how those machines are—always needing more coins, never stopping right. I just... I don’t know. Maybe I should check the pockets for loose change.

interviewer: I hear how the medication feels like it's prolonging the cycle rather than bringing relief. Can you tell me the name of the blue pills your doctor prescribed?

patient: I don’t know the name, just that they’re blue. Doctor says they’re for sleep, but... they just make me tired. My daughter’s been asking about the laundromat bills. You know how those machines are—always needing more coins, never stopping right. I just... I don’t know. Maybe I should check the pockets for loose change.

interviewer: Let me recap what I’ve heard: you’ve been feeling deeply hopeless and overwhelmed, especially since the divorce, with sleeplessness at night and exhaustion affecting your work and energy for things you used to enjoy. The stress of managing alone—like the laundromat routine and worries about financial stability—has added to the emotional weight, even though you’re holding onto your role as a parent as a reason to keep going. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?

patient: You got the weight of it, I guess. Maybe missed how the sewing... it’s not just gone, it’s like the colors bled out, you know? And those old R&B tunes I hum while I vacuum—tiny spark, but it’s all I’ve got left. And the letters... they pile up, unopened. Doesn’t matter. I always mess up, so why would it change?

interviewer: It sounds like the colors bleeding out of sewing and the R&B tunes being your only spark capture how your usual joys have faded, and the unopened letters show how it feels like nothing you do matters. What did I miss or get wrong about your experience?

patient: I guess you missed how my bones ache from hunching over mops just to feel useful. And the guilt—when my daughter texts, I freeze, scared to reply in case I say something... wrong. Like I’m one wrong move away from her hating me. But it’s fine. The machine’ll keep spinning. I’ll check those pockets for change eventually.

interviewer: It sounds like the physical toll of your work and the fear of failing your daughter are adding layers to the already heavy burden you’re carrying. Let me try to piece this together: You’ve described a pattern of sleeplessness, physical exhaustion from work, and a deep worry that your actions—or inactions—might push your daughter away. These struggles seem to be part of a longer cycle of feeling overwhelmed by responsibilities and doubting your own worth, especially since the divorce. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is showing up for you?

patient: You got the mop-aching and the texts, I guess. Maybe missed how the letters from my mom still pile up, unopened, in the mailbox. They always say I’m ‘letting people down’... but I can’t even fold my own laundry right some days. The machine keeps spinning, but sometimes I catch myself humming that old R&B tune while I vacuum—like if I focus hard enough on the dust, the rest of it fades. For a minute. Then the bills wait. And the silence from my daughter.

interviewer: It sounds like the unopened letters from your mom and the fear of disappointing your daughter are adding to the weight you’re carrying, even as small moments like the R&B songs offer fleeting relief. Let me try to piece this together: Your main concerns include chronic sleeplessness, physical exhaustion from work, strained communication with your daughter, and a sense that your efforts are never enough—despite holding onto small sparks of routine and creativity. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is showing up for you?

patient: I guess… you got most of it. The machine thing’s not just a metaphor, really. It’s like I’m stuck in the spin cycle—can’t control when it’ll stop. And the texts from my daughter, they just… sit there. I don’t even know what to say to her. Sometimes I think the blue pills help me sleep, but other times they just make me tired at work. My boss said I’m slowing down again. I don’t want to talk about the rest, not yet.

interviewer: It sounds like the sleeplessness, work fatigue, and strained connection with your daughter are central to the cycle you’re describing, along with the blue pills adding uncertainty. What did I miss or get wrong about how this is showing up for you?

patient: I guess... you didn’t mention how the landlord’s been hounding me about those late slips. And the texts from my daughter—they just sit there like crumpled laundry I can’t flatten. Sometimes I think the blue pills make me sleep, but other times they just... make me tired at work. My boss said I’m slowing down again. I don’t know how to fix that.

interviewer: It sounds like the landlord’s pressure and the unopened texts from your daughter are adding to the cycle you’re describing, along with the blue pills complicating your energy at work. What did I miss or get wrong about how these layers are showing up for you?

patient: The landlord... she’s been on my case about those late slips. I’ve been hauling laundry twice a week now—ain’t easy on these old bones. The texts from my daughter just... sit there. I keep thinking about that mop closet, how I line up the handles just right so it feels like I did something right. The blue pills? They help me sleep but leave me dragging at work. My boss said I’m slowing down again. I guess that’s just how it is.

interviewer: It sounds like carrying all of this has been incredibly heavy for you—thank you for sharing so much. Before we wrap up, are there any other concerns or questions you'd like to address before we plan next steps together?

patient: I guess… the laundromat trips are eatin’ at me more than I let on. Haulin’ that laundry twice a week, it’s like carryin’ stones in my pockets. And the texts… I still ain’t opened them letters from my mom. They just… sit there. The pills? I don’t know if they’re helpin’ or makin’ me numb. But the mop closet—lining up them handles, that’s the only thing that feels… right. I don’t know. Maybe that’s enough.

interviewer: It sounds like the mop closet gives you a rare sense of control right now. Before we finalize our next steps, is there anything else you’d like to address before we plan your follow-up?

patient: I guess... the church dinners sometimes. The wine they pass around, it helps mute the noise in my head. But I don’t want it to get to my head, y’know? And them letters from my mom... I still can’t bring myself to open ’em. Feels like if I do, I’ll just fold up more. The mop closet—lining up them handles, that’s the only thing that feels... solid. I don’t know. Maybe that’s enough.

interviewer: It sounds like finding stability in small rituals is helping you navigate the heaviness right now. Before we finalize our next steps, would you like to share any specific concerns about how we can support you moving forward?

patient: I guess... the landlord’s been on my back about those late slips again. It’s just... the laundromat line takes so much out of me, you know? I don’t know if I can keep juggling it all. And my daughter, she hasn’t texted in weeks. I try to answer, really, but sometimes the words just... fade. To be honest, the blue pills help me sleep, but they make my head feel like static. I don’t want to be a burden, but I’m scared I’ll mess up the one thing I’m supposed to get right.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure right now—thank you for sharing your strength. Before we schedule your next session, would you like to share any final thoughts or questions about how we can support you moving forward?

patient: I guess... I just worry that if I mess up the laundromat line or the landlord catches me napping, my daughter’ll have to hear about it from someone else. The pills help me rest, but my head feels like static when I try to think about her. I... I keep humming that old R&B tune when I mop to stay steady, but the words still freeze up. To be honest, I don’t know if I’m holding on for me or for her.

interviewer: It sounds like you're doing everything you can to stay steady for your daughter, even when it's hard. Before we close, would you like to share any final thoughts or questions about how we can support you moving forward?

patient: I guess... if you could just make sure the landlord doesn’t come敲 my door for the slips, that’d help. And maybe check if those blue pills can stop making my head feel like static when I try to think about my daughter. I keep humming that R&B tune when I mop to stay steady, but... the words still freeze up. To be honest, I don’t know if I’m holding on for me or for her.

interviewer: It sounds like you're doing everything you can to stay steady for your daughter, even when it's hard. Would you like to discuss how the blue pills are affecting your thinking about her or if there are adjustments we can consider?

patient: The blue pills help me rest, but my head feels like static when I try to think about her. I worry I’m not thinking straight, you know? Like, what if I mess up something important and she finds out through the landlord or something. I keep humming that R&B tune when I mop to stay steady, but the static makes it hard to focus on her.

interviewer: It sounds like you're doing everything you can to stay steady for your daughter, even when it's hard. Would you like to discuss how we can support you with the blue pills or the landlord's concerns before we finalize our next steps?

patient: I guess... if the pills could stop making my head feel like static when I think about her, that’d help. And maybe if you could say something to the landlord about those slips—just so she doesn’t hear about it. I keep humming that R&B tune when I mop to stay steady, but... the words still freeze up. I don’t know if I’m holding on for me or for her.

interviewer: It sounds like you're doing everything you can to hold things together for your daughter, even when it's so hard. Before we finalize our next steps, is there anything else you'd like to address about the blue pills or the landlord's concerns—or any other needs we should prioritize?

patient: The blue pills... they help me rest, I guess. But I still feel like that machine, stuck in the spin cycle. The landlord’s letters pile up like unwashed laundry—another weight, but what can you do? I just try to hold on for my daughter, even when the texts don’t get answered. I don’t know... maybe that’s enough.
