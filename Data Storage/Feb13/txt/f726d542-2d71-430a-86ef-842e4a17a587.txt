system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing this with me, Jason. I want to make sure we address any concerns you have about your safety. Have you considered any specific plans or actions related to these thoughts?

patient: To be honest, I... I don’t make plans. It’s more like these thoughts linger, you know? Like, ‘If I just disappeared, would anyone really miss me?’ But I suppose that’s just the fatigue talking. I’m tired—always tired. My hands shake when I can’t sleep, but I’ve told myself I’ll handle it. I mean, I have to. There’s the crossword puzzle, for example. I haven’t finished it in weeks. Doesn’t matter. Maybe it’s all just... temporary.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Jason. I want to check in—would you be comfortable continuing with this session and exploring these concerns further?

patient: I... suppose if you think it’s necessary. It’s just that my energy these days feels like a crossword I can’t finish—stuck on the same clue, going in circles. But I’ll try. If I’m being honest, I’ve told myself I’ll endure it, for the sake of... well, for the sake of not disappointing people. Even if I’m not sure I deserve that chance.

interviewer: It sounds like carrying this weight alone has been really hard. Do you understand that our session today will involve discussing your current concerns and how they impact your life?

patient: I... suppose that’s the plan. It’s just that talking about it feels like trying to fill in the crossword blanks when half the letters are already wrong. You spend so much time second-guessing every answer. But I’ll try. I’ve been telling myself that’s all I can do now—try, even if it feels like... like the effort might shatter something.

interviewer: It sounds like the effort to keep going feels both necessary and fragile for you. Before we continue, is there anything specific you’d like to know about how this session will work?

patient: I suppose... I just want to know if there’s a structure to this. Like a treatment plan. I’ve always found that... frameworks help. If there’s a way to track progress, or a method to follow, I can commit to that. But I’m not sure I’d recognize it if I saw it. It’s like trying to fill in a crossword clue when the paper is folded the wrong way. You know?

interviewer: I appreciate your openness in sharing that. Would you like me to briefly explain how our time together today will work?

patient: I suppose it’s like any patient-doctor conversation, isn’t it? You ask questions, I answer… though my mind often drifts, even when I try to focus. To be honest, the thought of structure feels both… comforting and like a trap. Like the crossword I can’t finish—every answer feels wrong, so I just leave it blank. My hands… they shake a bit when I think about sleep, or lack of it. But let’s proceed. I’ll try not to… derail things.

interviewer: I hear how structure feels both reassuring and restrictive for you right now. Would you say you understand the purpose of today’s session is to explore how these struggles are affecting your life, and that our time will involve discussing your experiences in your own way?

patient: I suppose that’s… accurate. I keep thinking about the crossword. How I used to enjoy the challenge, but now even staring at the grid feels overwhelming. I’ll look at a few letters, and my mind just… drifts. Or I second-guess every clue, like I’m afraid to put anything down for fear it’s wrong. My hands are shaking again, aren’t they? Probably just old age. But yes, I’ll answer as I can. Though I worry I’ll ramble, or worse—say nothing useful at all.

interviewer: It sounds like you've been carrying a lot lately. When did you first start noticing these feelings of overwhelm and disconnection?

patient: I suppose it’s… hard to say exactly when it began. Like a slow leak in a tire—you don’t notice it at first, but eventually, you’re just… flat. Maybe six months ago? My sleep started worsening, those nights where I’d stare at the ceiling until 3 a.m., my hands trembling like I’d just finished a surgery. I told myself it was burnout, or age. But then… the crossword. I used to relish it, but now even filling in the simplest clues feels like… surgery without anesthesia. I keep waiting for it to pass, but it’s just… persistent. Like a bad rash.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone. What would you most hope to achieve through our work together?

patient: I suppose… I want to find a way to stop feeling like I’m failing at everything. Not just the crossword, but… the basics. Like keeping up with my routines without them collapsing into nothing. I don’t know. Maybe to stop seeing every small task as some kind of test I’m guaranteed to mess up. My hands… they’re shaking again. Probably just stress. But if we could figure out how to quiet that noise in my head, even a little, that would help. I think.

interviewer: It sounds like these feelings have been building for some time. Can you share more about how they’ve changed or shifted since that initial six-month mark—any moments when they felt worse or different?

patient: I suppose… there was a point around three months in when it felt like the floor dropped out. My sleepless nights became… relentless. I’d wake at 2 a.m., hands shaking, and just lie there, replaying a patient’s chart I’d misread weeks prior. Not that it mattered, but the guilt—it clung. Then there was the dinner I canceled again. My wife didn’t say much, just… sighed. That’s when I realized I wasn’t just tired. I was… scared. Scared I’d forget my own routines, like the crossword. Now even looking at it feels like staring into a void. I tell myself it’s stress, but part of me wonders if I’m just… unraveling.

interviewer: It sounds like this has been a really challenging time for you. Have you experienced episodes in the past where you felt similarly overwhelmed or disconnected, and if so, what helped during those times?

patient: I... I suppose there were times in residency when the hours were grueling. Back then, I just pushed through, told myself it was part of the process. Now, though? Even that feels... different. My sleep’s been so fragmented—my hands shake when I try to make tea in the morning, and I blame it on old age, I suppose. But the truth is... the truth is I don’t know how to slow down without feeling like I’m failing. Routines help, maybe? Though half the time I’m just going through the motions. Have you ever felt like you’re pretending to function until the pretending becomes the thing?

interviewer: It’s clear how the pressure of residency shaped your resilience then, but now it feels heavier. Have there been other times in your life, besides residency, where you felt similarly overwhelmed or disconnected, and if so, what helped during those periods?

patient: I... I suppose there was a time after my father passed. He was always... relentless about precision. After he died, I thought maybe I’d feel some relief, but it was just more pressure to prove I wasn’t ‘incompetent’—his word, not mine. I pushed harder, worked longer. But this? This feels different. Now, even getting through the day... it’s like solving a crossword where the clues don’t make sense. (Pauses, fingers tapping the armrest.) And when I do manage to focus, it’s on all the things I’m messing up. The bills. The dinners. Everything.

interviewer: It’s clear how your father’s expectations and his passing have shaped your drive. When you were pushing harder after his death, what specific strategies or supports helped you cope with that pressure back then?

patient: I suppose I just... worked longer hours. Tried to bury myself in patients’ cases. It kept my mind from... wandering, I guess. Now, even that feels like a chore. My hands still shake when I try to focus, but I tell myself it’s just age. Have you ever felt like your body betrays you even when you’re trying to pretend?

interviewer: Jason, it sounds like the past six months have brought overwhelming fatigue, sleeplessness, and a sense of being disconnected from your work and relationships, with thoughts about your value and fears of losing yourself. What did I miss here?

patient: I suppose... I haven’t mentioned how I’m avoiding the bills. My daughter’s student loans—she’s in med school, you know? I took on the payments quietly, but now the numbers blur when I look at them. (Pauses, fingers brushing a non-existent wrinkle on his shirt.) Last week, I left a stack of unpaid statements on the kitchen counter. My wife didn’t say anything, but I could see it in her eyes. ‘Here we go again.’ That’s the worst part—feeling like a burden, even when no one says it out loud. Have you ever carried a weight so heavy it feels like it’s hollowing you out?

interviewer: Jason, to recap: You’ve described a six-month pattern of overwhelming fatigue, sleepless nights leading to physical symptoms like trembling hands, and cognitive struggles that make even routine tasks feel impossible. Financial stress around your daughter’s loans has added to a deep sense of being a burden, compounded by marital strain and fears of failing yourself and others. The formulation I’m considering includes long-standing perfectionism and pressure to meet expectations (predisposing), recent stressors like the unpaid bills and work errors (precipitating), and cycles of avoidance and self-criticism keeping things stuck (perpetuating). Protective factors include your commitment to seeking help and your relational responsibilities. Does this align with your experience, or would you like to adjust anything before we discuss next steps?

patient: I suppose... that summary isn’t far off. The crossword metaphor still fits—every clue feels scrambled, and the more I stare, the more blanks there seem to be. (Pauses, fingers stilling on the armrest.) What I maybe haven’t said enough is how the tea ritual... it’s not just routine. It’s the only thing that feels like *me* left. Even if I’m just going through the motions. (Soft, bitter chuckle.) But of course you’d focus on the cracks, not the cracks *between* the cracks. Have you ever tried fixing something by making sure the broken parts stay aligned?

interviewer: Jason, the tea ritual sounds like a meaningful anchor for you amid so much uncertainty. What did I miss in our discussion about what’s been most central to your experience lately?

patient: The tea... it's just something I do. I suppose it keeps me from thinking too much. The crossword... I can't even finish that now. And the sleep... you know how it is with old age. You lose the plot, one way or another.

interviewer: Jason, you’ve highlighted how the tea ritual is more than a routine—it’s a rare moment of grounding when so much else feels fragmented. What else feels central to your experience that I might have overlooked?

patient: It’s... the silence, I guess. How everything just... quiets down when I’m around. My daughter’s loans, the bills—I leave them on the counter, and my wife... she doesn’t say a word. I suppose that’s just how it is. People get used to things. And the crossword... I used to take pride in filling those grids. Now I can’t even find the first clue. It’s like my mind’s full of blanks, but I’m too tired to look up the answers.

interviewer: Jason, the silence you describe and the metaphor of the crossword puzzle both feel like important threads in this picture. Before we move to next steps, is there anything else you’d like to add about how these patterns have shaped your experience?

patient: I suppose it’s the... the weight of it all. How even the small things—like the crossword, or making tea—feel like they’re slipping through my fingers. I leave the bills on the counter, and I tell myself it’s just temporary, that I’ll get back to them. But my wife... she doesn’t say anything. I guess that’s how it’s supposed to be. People adapt. You adapt. It’s just... tiring, you know? Being tired all the time.

interviewer: Jason, the weight you describe and the fatigue that feels endless are clearly central to how you’re navigating this. Let’s make sure we’ve captured everything important before we think about next steps—does anything else feel urgent or overlooked that we should address?

patient: I suppose... the thing I haven’t said out loud is how I feel like I’m letting everyone down. The bills, the dinners, the crossword—it’s all evidence I’m failing. But maybe that’s just old-age paranoia. I mean, have you ever felt like the world would keep turning even if you just... stopped trying? No, that’s dramatic. Probably just tired.

interviewer: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry, Jason. Before we discuss next steps, is there anything else you’d like to add about how these feelings of being a burden or failing are showing up for you?

patient: I suppose... the worst part is how it’s not just the things I stop doing. It’s the things I *do*—like leaving the bills on the counter, knowing my wife sees them. I tell myself she’s used to it, but what if she’s just waiting for me to fix it? And the loans for my daughter... I take them, but I can’t even track the payments anymore. It’s like I’m a ghost in the room, breathing down everyone’s neck but not really there. You know how it is—old age turns you into a burden whether you want to or not.
