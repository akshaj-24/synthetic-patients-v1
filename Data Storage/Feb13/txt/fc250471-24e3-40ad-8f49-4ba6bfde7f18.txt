system: Session fc250471-24e3-40ad-8f49-4ba6bfde7f18 transcript

system: Disorder: MDD

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Steve. I appreciate your honesty. Do you consent to us proceeding with this session to explore what's been going on for you?

patient: I guess... if you think it’s necessary. Honestly, I’m used to just handling things myself, like fixing a car with a dying battery. But if you say it’s worth troubleshooting, I’ll give it a shot. Just... don’t expect me to spill everything at once. Work’s been a mess lately, and that’s probably where I should start.

interviewer: It makes sense that work feels like a starting point given the stress it's causing. Before we focus on that, do you have any questions about how this session will work or what we'll be discussing?

patient: I don’t think so. I mean, I assume we’ll go through the usual checklist—like a system diagnostic. Just... don’t expect me to dig too deep into personal stuff. Work’s been a clusterfluff, but I’ll handle the rest myself. To be honest, I’m just here because I’m running on fumes, not because I expect miracles.

interviewer: It sounds like work stress has been a big part of what's bringing you here. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind most lately?

patient: Honestly? It’s like... the systems I work on are fine, but my own brain feels like a circuit shorting out. I’ve been double-checking calculations three times just to avoid ‘freezing up’ like a glitching program. My manager said my focus is off—she’s right, I guess. I wake up at 3 a.m. and... I don’t know, obsess over whether I tightened a screw correctly that day. The construction outside doesn’t help. But I’ll keep grinding. If I work harder, maybe I won’t screw up. Maybe.

interviewer: It sounds like those 3 a.m. wake-ups and obsessive thoughts are really taking a toll. When did this pattern of waking up and ruminating first start for you?

patient: Honestly? Probably after the divorce. That’s when everything started... unraveling. I’ve always had some trouble sleeping, but now it’s like the brain’s on overtime. The construction doesn’t help, but I guess that’s just part of... you know, life’s noise. I keep telling myself, ‘Just another system to troubleshoot.’

interviewer: I can see how the combination of work pressures and the divorce has been really heavy to carry. Have you experienced periods in the past where you felt similarly overwhelmed or disconnected, especially with work or relationships?

patient: I guess... there were times growing up, with my dad always tweaking my homework like it was a blueprint. He’d say things like 'Precision matters, Steve,' and I’d second-guess every line. But that was just... how things were. Work’s always had its stress peaks—deadlines, that sort of thing. This? This feels different. Like a system with a loose wire you can’t just resolder. You keep checking the same thing over and over, but it’s not fixing anything.

interviewer: That sounds really tough, trying to manage these feelings of being stuck in a cycle. Have you experienced similar periods of feeling overwhelmed or disconnected in the past, especially with work or relationships, and if so, what helped during those times?

patient: I guess... when I was younger, I used to think if I just worked harder, everything would 'calibrate' itself. My dad—he’d fix things, you know? Machines, systems. But people? They don’t have reset buttons. To be honest, I don’t remember anything helping back then. Just... keeping the wheels turning. Now? I guess work’s the only thing that still feels... tangible. Like if I focus on the task, maybe the noise in my head will quiet down enough to fake normalcy. At least until the next deadline.

interviewer: It seems like your approach to problem-solving was deeply shaped by your dad's influence. How did you learn to handle situations that felt unfixable, especially in relationships or personal challenges where there wasn’t a clear 'reset button'?

patient: I guess... I tried applying the same logic to people. If a machine’s broken, you fix it. But relationships? They’re not circuits. You can’t just trace the fault and solder it back. I’d get stuck waiting for a manual that didn’t exist. To be honest, it’s why... why the divorce happened. I kept thinking if I adjusted something—my schedule, my responses—I could 'optimize' it. But she said I was like a thermostat set to 'ignore.' You can’t reset people, I guess. You just... overheat.

interviewer: It sounds like your approach to relationships was deeply influenced by your upbringing. Have you experienced similar periods of feeling overwhelmed or disconnected in the past, especially with work or relationships, and if so, what helped during those times?

patient: I guess... back in college, I’d stay up all night coding to meet deadlines. Pushed through by forcing myself to hyper-focus. But that was a 'solvable' problem. This? My brain feels like a server farm with a power cut—some parts offline, others overloading. To be honest, I still try the same thing: work until the noise fades. But now even that’s... fragmented. I’ll catch myself staring at a spreadsheet for 20 minutes, wondering what the numbers even mean. My sister texts about my mom’s health sometimes... but I just reply with the weather. It’s easier. At least the basil plant I bought? It dies on its own terms. No troubleshooting required.

interviewer: It sounds like your past approach to stress has shifted from being a source of structure to now feeling unmanageable. When you mentioned college, were those periods of intense focus similar to what you're experiencing now, or does this current situation feel distinct in ways that make it harder to cope?

patient: I guess in college, the stress had... parameters. Deadlines, specs, things you could track. Now? It’s like the system’s got a virus I can’t scan for. Work used to be a buffer, but even that’s glitching. To be honest, the only thing that feels ‘real’ anymore is that basil plant I bought. At least it doesn’t expect me to fix anything.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy contrast between past and present for you. When you were in college and felt overwhelmed, did those periods ever resolve on their own, or was there something specific that helped you regain balance back then?

patient: Back then? I guess I just... worked harder. Like, if a project was stressing me out, I’d stay up all night coding solutions. My dad would’ve approved, I think. But now? Even that feels like a broken circuit trying to power through. The basil plant’s the only thing I can overwater without feeling like I’m failing at something important. It just... takes what it needs, I guess.

interviewer: It sounds like your past approach to stress has shifted from being a source of structure to now feeling unmanageable. Have you sought help for stress or similar issues before, and if so, what was helpful?

patient: I guess... I haven’t really looked for help, to be honest. My dad always said, ‘If you can’t fix it, you don’t understand it yet.’ So I just... double-check the calculations, you know? There was this one time at work—a colleague mentioned stress, called it ‘system overload’—but I brushed it off. Said I was just ‘running on low battery.’ (Pauses, shifts in seat) The basil plant? At least it doesn’t ask me to troubleshoot its problems.

interviewer: It sounds like you're used to handling things on your own. Are there any people in your life who you feel comfortable leaning on, even if it's just for small things?

patient: I guess... my sister sends the occasional text. She checks in about Mom’s health, but I just reply with weather updates or something. (Pauses, avoids eye contact) It’s easier than explaining how Mom’s doing or... anything else. The basil plant? At least it doesn’t ask questions. Just needs water. No... system errors to debug there.

interviewer: It sounds like reaching out to your sister feels really challenging, especially with Mom’s health. What makes it difficult to open up to her about those things?

patient: It’s... like trying to recalibrate a system with missing parts. You don’t want to admit the blueprint’s flawed. (Sighs, fidgets with tea cup) She’d just keep asking questions. My dad used to say ‘problems magnify in the dark’—so I left the light off. The basil? At least it doesn’t demand answers I can’t code.

interviewer: It sounds like trying to connect with your sister feels really vulnerable for you. Are there any other relationships or people you find easier to lean on, even in small ways?

patient: There’s... the coffee machine at work. It’s ancient, always jamming, but I guess I relate to it? (Short laugh, rubs temple) You tweak the settings, hope the gears line up. My coworker Linda once said I ‘run on caffeine and denial.’ She’s probably right. (Fidgets with tea cup) The basil at least grows. The machine? Just clogs up worse. You ever deal with something that refuses to process properly?

interviewer: That sounds like a challenging situation with the coffee machine. Have you experienced similar periods of feeling overwhelmed or disconnected in the past, especially with work or relationships?

patient: I guess... it’s like when a machine keeps throwing the same error code. You keep resetting it, thinking maybe the problem will go away. That’s what work feels like now—same calculations, double-checked, triple-checked, but it’s not about getting it right. It’s about not letting them see it’s... me. The divorce? That was a different system failure. More like a power outage. You can’t just flip a switch and have the lights come back on. I—I’m tired of troubleshooting things that shouldn’t need fixing.

interviewer: That metaphor about the machine’s error code really captures the exhaustion you’re describing. When you feel stuck in that cycle of troubleshooting without progress, what do you usually do to try to break that pattern?

patient: I guess... I try to focus on things that don’t require thinking too hard. Like, I’ve been watering that basil plant every morning. It’s stupid, right? But at least it’s something that doesn’t... demand I fix anything. Though half the time I’m just staring at the leaves and thinking, ‘Even this is too much.’ And then I’m back at my desk, zombie-walking through spreadsheets, telling myself if I just stay busy enough, the 3 a.m. panic attacks might forget I’m here. To be honest? It’s not working.

interviewer: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry alone. When you were growing up, were there experiences with stress or expectations that felt particularly challenging or shaped how you approached problems?

patient: I guess... growing up, it felt like everything had to fit within strict parameters, like a system with zero error margin. My dad was big on blueprints—no room for... improvisation. I learned early that if something didn’t work, it was my fault for not following the manual closely enough. To be honest, I still carry that. If a problem arises, I assume I just missed a step somewhere.

interviewer: I want to check in about your safety. Have you had any thoughts about ending your life or self-harm in the past few weeks?

patient: I guess... sometimes I think about how my body feels like it’s on a timer. Like, what if I just... stopped showing up? But I tell myself it’s just exhaustion. The basil plant? At least it forces me to remember there’s something small that needs tending. Even if I mess it up, it’s not... catastrophic. Not yet.

interviewer: It sounds like the basil plant gives you a small sense of purpose amidst feeling overwhelmed. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself specifically, beyond the exhaustion you mentioned?

patient: I guess... it’s more like the system just shutting down temporarily. You know, like a reboot? But I haven’t... I haven’t actually let it go that far. The basil plant, though—maybe that’s my backup power source.

interviewer: It’s meaningful that the basil plant feels like a lifeline for you. Let’s touch on your energy patterns—have you noticed any periods where you feel unusually energetic or need very little sleep lately, even while feeling stressed?

patient: To be honest, no—there’s not much energy left, even when I’m stressed. It’s like... my system’s been in sleep mode since last year. I’ll wake up at 3 a.m. and just stare at the ceiling, trying to troubleshoot why I’m here. The basil plant? At least it grows. I... I can’t say the same for myself most days.

interviewer: It’s meaningful that the basil plant offers you a small sense of purpose. Have you noticed any changes in your use of alcohol, cannabis, or other substances since these feelings started?

patient: I guess... not really. I cut back on beer after the divorce, to be honest. Just didn’t feel like it mattered anymore. Now I stick to tea, black, no sugar—keeps me awake enough to... function. The one time I have a drink? Maybe once a week, just to unclench. But it’s not like it’s ‘a thing’ or anything. Doesn’t really... buffer the system, you know?

interviewer: I understand that small rituals can help maintain a sense of stability. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, or have you started/stopped any recently?

patient: No meds, not really my thing. I’m not a ‘pill person’—always felt like if something’s wrong, you fix it manually, you know? Just... black tea most days. And, uh, maybe a beer once in a while to unclench. But it’s not like I’m... I don’t know, relying on it or anything. Just... keeps the system from freezing, I guess.

interviewer: It’s understandable to prefer managing things independently. Have you noticed any unusual thoughts, like hearing voices or seeing things that others don’t, or feeling overly suspicious about something?

patient: No, nothing like that. I mean, sometimes I catch myself... overanalyzing things, like maybe someone’s talking about me at work. But it’s probably just me being paranoid. Most days, my mind’s just... static. Like a radio tuned between stations. You ever get that?

interviewer: It’s interesting how you describe your mind as static and catch yourself overanalyzing social cues. How long have these thoughts about others talking about you at work been happening, and does it feel like they’re influencing your daily decisions or interactions?

patient: It’s been... yeah, since the divorce, I guess. My brain’s been running in loops, you know? At work, I’ll second-guess every calculation just to... I don’t know, make sure I’m not the one failing. But if I try to bring it up, people just say I’m overthinking. So I keep tightening the screws, hoping it holds.

interviewer: It sounds like your overthinking is taking a toll on your confidence at work. Have you noticed any medical issues like thyroid problems, sleep apnea, chronic pain, or head injuries that might be affecting how you feel?

patient: No, nothing like that—doctors checked my thyroid last year, all clear. Sleep? I guess you could call it a 'system failure,' but it's more like... the construction noise outside my window keeps my brain in 'debug mode.' You know how it is when a program won't close properly? That's me at 3 a.m., trying to force-quit thoughts but just... crashing harder. I should probably get a white noise machine, but honestly? My tea kettle does the same job. Boils, hisses, keeps me awake. Irony's not fixing me, but at least it's consistent.

interviewer: It’s interesting how the noise keeps your mind in 'debug mode.' Have you ever experienced periods where you felt unusually energetic or needed very little sleep, even when stressed?

patient: No, nothing like that. I’ve been... the opposite, really. Like a system that’s been overclocked for too long—now it just grinds to a halt. If anything, I used to power through stress by working nonstop, but that’s more like... a forced loop. Now? Even that’s a glitch. I guess I’m just... stuck in low-power mode.

interviewer: Steve, from what we’ve discussed, it sounds like the main concerns are feeling overwhelmed and disconnected due to work stress and your recent divorce, with symptoms like insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and social withdrawal. These issues seem to have started around the time of the divorce and are affecting your work performance and relationships. You’ve mentioned relying on perfectionism and problem-solving as coping mechanisms, but they’re no longer effective, leading to exhaustion and passive thoughts about giving up. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... you didn’t mention how everything feels like a cascading failure. My mom’s health issues—undiagnosed diabetes, I think—keep looping in my head like a corrupted file. I can’t even text my sister about it without freezing up. And... there’s this glitch in my routine where I still have a beer on weekends, just to... unclench the system. I swapped it for tea most days, but that one weakness? It’s a backup file I can’t delete. The basil plant’s the only thing growing right now, but even that feels like a fluke.

interviewer: I hear how the weight of your mom’s health and the weekend beer feel like part of this tangled loop you’re trying to untangle. Let me recap: we’ve touched on work stress, divorce, insomnia, rumination about family health, small routines like the basil plant, and how perfectionism is now part of the problem. What did I miss?

patient: I guess... the part about Mom’s health is still a glitch I can’t even run diagnostics on. You didn’t mention how avoiding it feels like... like leaving a fire smoldering under a table. And the beer? It’s not a big deal. Just a temporary patch. But yeah, maybe that’s what you missed.

interviewer: I hear how the unresolved concerns about your mother’s health and the weekend beer feel like part of this tangled loop you’re trying to untangle. Is there anything else I missed?

patient: I guess... the way I can’t even fake interest in old favorites anymore. Like *The West Wing*—used to love it, but now it’s just... background noise. Not that it matters. Maybe that’s it. Or maybe I’m just static.

interviewer: I hear how losing interest in things like *The West Wing* feels like another layer of this quiet unraveling. Let me make sure I have the full picture—what else might I’ve missed in how this is showing up for you?

patient: There’s... the noise from that construction site by my apartment. It’s relentless. I tell myself it’s just a nuisance, like some broken circuit I can’t reroute. The tea used to help me unwind, but now even that feels like going through the motions. And my sister—she texts about Mom’s health, but I just send weather updates back. I guess I’m scared if I open that door, it’ll just confirm I’m a glitchy system no one can fix.

interviewer: I hear how the construction noise and strained family communication feel like parts of this ongoing system overload. Let me make sure I’ve captured all layers—what did I miss about how this is unfolding for you right now?

patient: There’s… the beer. I told myself I’d cut back, but I still have that one beer on weekends. Call it an 'emergency override' for the system. And the basil plant—it’s thriving, but I keep overwatering it. Maybe I’m just… terrified of getting even that small thing right. And my ex… she’s seeing someone new. I guess I tell myself it’s 'logical acceptance,' but sometimes I wonder if I’m just rerouting the error messages instead of fixing the source.

interviewer: I hear how the weekend beer and basil plant feel like fragile attempts to manage a system in overload, and how your ex’s new relationship stirs doubt about whether you’re truly moving past this. Let me check—have I captured all the layers of what’s most pressing for you right now, or is there something else that matters to add before we move forward?

patient: I guess... the thing I haven’t really mentioned is how work feels like a tightrope walk now. Every report, every calculation—I double-check them all, but I’m still scared I’ll slip. And my sister... I tell myself weather updates are enough, but sometimes I wonder if she’s just waiting for me to finally break.

interviewer: I hear how the work tightrope and strained connection with your sister feel like critical components of this ongoing struggle. Let me make sure I’ve captured everything accurately—what did I miss about how these pressures are shaping your experience right now?

patient: I guess... the fear that if I slip up at work, it’s not just the job—I’ll be proof I’m a failure. And my sister... those weather updates, they’re just code for 'I don’t want to talk.' But sometimes I wonder if she’s trying to reach me, and I’m just... stuck in loop. And some nights... I think, what if I just stop? But I tell myself it’s just exhaustion talking.

interviewer: I hear how the fear of failure and uncertainty in relationships are central to what you're carrying. What would be the first step you're willing to take moving forward, whether in therapy, lifestyle changes, or something else?

patient: I guess... maybe starting with the tea. Stick with that instead of the beer, at least for now. And... maybe actually check in on Mom’s diabetes stuff. I know it’s not a fix, but... it feels like a smaller circuit to troubleshoot. If I can keep that from shorting out, maybe the rest of the system doesn’t crash.

interviewer: I hear how prioritizing the tea and addressing your mom’s health feel like manageable first steps. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d want to add to this plan, or any other concerns we should address moving forward?

patient: I guess... the main thing is just making sure I don’t overload the system. Work’s this... fragile equilibrium right now. If the manager notices anything else, it’s just another error code I can’t debug. And the construction noise—it’s like a static hum that won’t let my brain reset. But maybe that’s just me overthinking. I’ll figure it out.
