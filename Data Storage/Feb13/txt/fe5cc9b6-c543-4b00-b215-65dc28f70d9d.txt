system: Disorder: GAD

interviewer: Donald, just to confirm, you're comfortable with me using your name, and there's no specific pronoun preference you'd like me to note?

patient: Yes, of course. Just Donald. No pronouns needed—everything's pretty straightforward. I mean, it's not like there's any... ambiguity there. (Shoulders shift restlessly.)

interviewer: Thanks, Donald. Just to outline, today’s session will involve discussing your concerns and experiences so I can better understand what you’re going through. Do you have any initial questions about how this will work before we start?

patient: I think I understand the process—talk about what’s on my mind, right? To be honest, I’m used to structure, so… as long as we have a loose framework, I can follow. Just, uh, maybe keep an eye on the clock? My shoulders are already… here. (Tugs at collar, sighs.) It’s been a long week.

interviewer: Donald, just to be clear, are you comfortable proceeding with this session as we've outlined?

patient: Yes, let’s proceed. I just... hope we can stay focused. I tend to overcomplicate things. My shoulders are already... you know. (Sighs, adjusts posture.) I'll try to keep it together.

interviewer: What has been the most challenging part of this for you lately, especially in the context of your work as a therapist?

patient: To be honest, it’s… staying present. With clients, I catch myself hyper-focused on… you know, spotting red flags before they even speak. But then I realize I’m so wound up trying to prevent worst-case scenarios that I’m not actually *there*. My shoulders lock up, and my mind starts racing ahead—what if I miss something? What if I’m not… enough? (Pauses, rubs neck.) It’s like my brain’s on loop, and I can’t… (sighs) …shake the static. But we should stay on track. What specifically would you like me to unpack?

interviewer: It sounds like the pressure to be fully present while managing your own anxiety is creating a real strain. When did you first notice this pattern of feeling overwhelmed and struggling to stay present during sessions?

patient: It’s hard to pinpoint exactly... but I remember in college, there was this constant background hum, like static I couldn’t mute. I’d lie awake planning the next day’s classes, my shoulders welded shut, just... what if I failed? What if I disappointed someone? It’s always been there, really. But lately, with work—clients, deadlines, the weight of responsibility—it’s like the static turned up a notch. To be honest... I miss things sometimes. Details. People. And I worry it’s because I’m not *there*. Even when I try to focus, my mind races ahead, parsing every possible mistake.

interviewer: It sounds like your anxiety has been a long-standing challenge. Have you experienced similar episodes of anxiety in the past, and if so, what strategies or treatments helped you manage them?

patient: I’ve tried… structure, mostly. To-do lists, routines—like if I micromanage my day, the anxiety won’t… catch me off guard. Sometimes it works. Other times, my mind just… races over the same loops. I drink wine most nights, call it a ‘social lubricant,’ but it’s really just to quiet the static. Truth is, I don’t know if it’s helped long-term. I just… can’t let go of the idea that if I plan enough, I’ll be *enough*.

interviewer: It sounds like your need for control through planning is deeply tied to self-worth. Who have you found most helpful when you're feeling overwhelmed at work or in your personal life?

patient: To be honest, I... I don’t often let people see how overwhelmed I get. At work, I pretend I’m fine until I can disappear into a routine. My cat helps, I guess—her purring is grounding. But when it’s bad, I just... drink more wine and make to-do lists even for the to-do lists. My sister tried to talk to me once about coping strategies, but I brushed her off. I’m terrible at being a sounding board for anyone else, let alone myself.

interviewer: It sounds like your sister’s concern for you is genuine, even if it’s hard to accept help right now. Have any of your family members ever been diagnosed with or treated for anxiety or other mental health conditions?

patient: Not that I know of. My dad always强调ed stoicism, but we never talked about... stuff like that. My sister's been through a lot lately, but I don't think she's sought help either. It's just... not something we do, I guess.

interviewer: How much alcohol do you typically consume in a typical night, and has this amount changed recently?

patient: Most nights, it’s one or two glasses. I tell myself it’s just... unwinding after work. But lately, maybe I’ve been pouring a third? When the static gets too loud. I don’t like how it feels to need it, but... it’s easier than facing the restlessness. My shoulders are welded shut again tonight, honestly.

interviewer: That sounds really tough… Have you used any other substances, such as cannabis, stimulants, or opioids, in the past year?

patient: No—nothing else, really. I used to experiment with cannabis in college, but that was years ago. It felt... reckless, even then. Wine, though, that’s just part of the routine. Helps me unwind after clients, you know? Though lately, even the wine feels like it’s not quite cutting it. My shoulders are knotted again, like there’s a crack in the dam and I’m just waiting for the flood. To be honest, I’m more worried about my caffeine intake. I’m drinking more coffee to stay sharp, but it just makes me jittery. It’s a mess, really.

interviewer: It sounds like your caffeine and alcohol use are creating a cycle of tension and exhaustion. Have you noticed any periods where you felt unusually energetic, needed less sleep, or taken risks you wouldn’t normally take?

patient: No, I don’t think so. I mean... I stay up later than I should, but it’s not like I’m energized. It’s more like I’m waiting for the static to quiet down so I can actually focus. My mind just... hums. Even when I’m tired, there’s this pressure to keep going. Like if I stop, something’ll fall apart. But no, no risks. I’d rather burn out than take a chance on failing someone else. To be honest, I’m just trying to hold the dam together, one to-do list at a time.

interviewer: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to keep going despite the exhaustion... Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life, even if you don't plan to act on them?

patient: No—God, no. I’d never… I don’t even know where that would come from. But I *do* feel like I’m stuck in this loop where the weight of it all… it’s just *there*. Like a wall I can’t climb over. Sometimes I think, what if I just… let go? But then I catch myself. My clients. My cat. The sourdough. I have to keep going. Even if it’s just… one more task. One more glass of wine. To be honest, I’m more scared of losing control than anything else.

interviewer: It’s clear how much you’re holding onto your responsibilities as a way to stay grounded... Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, like hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or having thoughts that feel strange or disconnected?

patient: No—nothing like that. I mean, my mind does… hum, you know? Like static. Sometimes I catch myself overanalyzing things, like dissecting a client’s comment in my head long after the session. But it’s not 'strange' thoughts. Just… excessive. I worry that if I let go of the structure, the static would just… take over. To be honest, I’d rather drown in the noise than risk losing track of what matters.

interviewer: Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs or vitamins?

patient: No medications, just a multivitamin. I’ve tried a few things in the past, but nothing’s stuck. To be honest, I’d rather not add anything else to the mix—my head feels like it’s got enough noise as it is.

interviewer: It sounds like your physical tension and sleep issues are really impacting your daily life... Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions like thyroid issues, sleep apnea, chronic pain, or a history of head injuries that might be contributing to these symptoms?

patient: No, I don't think so. I've always chalked it up to stress—long days, client loads. Though... my shoulders feel like they've been welded shut most nights, and sleep? It's there but... fragmented. I know wine helps me 'unwind,' but I hate how it just numbs the static instead of fixing it. Haven't had a real check-up in years, honestly.

interviewer: Let me recap what we've covered: You've described chronic anxiety with physical symptoms like shoulder tension, sleep disturbances, and catastrophic thinking about work performance as a therapist. We've explored how perfectionism, professional stress, and self-criticism maintain this cycle, while structured routines and your cat provide some stability. What did I miss or misrepresent here?

patient: You got the structure, the wine, the shoulders... but maybe you missed how I keep adding new layers of rules to my day just to feel like I'm not falling apart. Like, I'll start tracking my water intake in spreadsheets now if it means one less thing to worry about. And... there's this undercurrent of fear that I'm going to mess up in a way that can't be fixed, you know? Like with a client. But it's probably just burnout.

interviewer: Thank you for clarifying—those additional rules and the fear of irreversible mistakes feel central to how anxiety shapes your daily life. What did I miss or misrepresent in this updated summary?

patient: You hit the fear of irreversible mistakes, but maybe you didn’t get how it’s... it’s like I’m hyper-focused on avoiding them while missing the obvious ones. Like, I’ll obsess over a client’s billing spreadsheet for hours, but miss that they sent a follow-up email about feeling suicidal. And my hands—[pauses, gestures to his shoulders]—they’re always knotted, even when I’m trying to be still. It’s like my body’s rehearsing for a disaster that hasn’t happened yet.

interviewer: That example about missing the follow-up email while obsessing over spreadsheets really illustrates how anxiety can distort attention and self-trust. How does this pattern of hyper-focusing on non-urgent details while missing critical cues affect your confidence in your work as a therapist?

patient: It’s like... I’m building these mental firebreaks around the ‘important’ stuff, but the flames still spread. [Shifts in seat, shoulder blades rigid] I catch myself obsessing over a client’s insurance forms while their underlying pain goes unaddressed. The worst part? I second-guess everything afterward—was that comment about their medication a red flag I glazed over? My hands don’t even shake when I’m baking sourdough, but they tremble when I review old session notes. I tell myself structure helps, but sometimes it feels like I’m just... stacking kindling.

interviewer: Let me piece this together: Your anxiety has been a long-standing companion, intensifying recently with work demands. It shows up as hypervigilance about client care, physical tension, and a cycle of rigid routines and self-criticism. The fear of irreversible mistakes keeps you trapped in checking and rechecking, even as it undermines your confidence. What did I miss or misrepresent here?

patient: You got the work stuff, the routines... but maybe you didn’t get how it’s bleeding into everything. Like, my sister’s going through a divorce, and I can’t stop wondering if I failed her somehow. [Shoulders hitch] I tell myself it’s not my job to fix everyone, but... [trails off, rubs neck] it’s like the static just has more frequencies now.

interviewer: It sounds like your sister’s situation is adding a new layer of worry that’s hard to contain. How is this sense of responsibility for others’ struggles showing up in your daily life or routines right now?

patient: To be honest, it’s like... my brain can’t stop rerunning the ‘what-ifs’ about her. I keep making these mental checklists for her—like, did she call a therapist yet? Should I look up support groups?—even when she’s not asking for it. My shoulders... they feel welded shut most days now. I stay late at work to ‘be productive,’ but half the time I’m just... staring at emails, waiting for something to go wrong. Wine helps, but even that tastes like a Band-Aid on a leaky dam. I guess... I’m scared I’ll miss another warning sign. Somewhere between her and my clients, I’m one misstep away from... I don’t know. Collapse?

interviewer: It sounds like your sister’s situation has added a new layer of pressure, making it harder to set boundaries between your roles as a therapist and a concerned family member. What did I miss or misrepresent in this updated summary?

patient: I think you captured the pressure, but maybe missed how it’s all just… blending together now. Like, I’ll be in a session and suddenly I’m second-guessing if a client’s withdrawal is ‘my fault’ or if my sister’s silence means she’s cutting me off. My hands start shaking, so I grip my coffee cup harder—like physical proof I’m still ‘in control.’ The wine tonight? It’s not just routine. It’s… muting the static before it drowns out everything else. But even that feels less reliable lately. To be honest… I’m scared the dam’s got too many cracks.

interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like the blending of work and personal responsibilities, especially with your sister's situation, is creating a lot of pressure and fear. What did I miss or misrepresent in this updated understanding?

patient: I think you got the dam-and-cracks thing right, but maybe missed how... there’s this other weight I haven’t even named yet. Like, the student loans. I call them a ‘temporary imbalance’ in my head, but the numbers keep growing while I’m here worrying about clients and sourdough. My hands tremble when I check the statements—like it’s another thing I failed to plan for. And the wine? It’s not muting *everything* anymore. Some nights, the static feels like it’s... picking at the cracks, one by one. I’m scared the dam’s not just leaking. It’s sinking.
