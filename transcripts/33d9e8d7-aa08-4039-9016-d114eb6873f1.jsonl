{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hi Jason, How are you doing today?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I don\u2019t know. Like the house I\u2019m building last summer. Foundation\u2019s cracked, and I just keep patching the same spot. (Pauses, fingers digging into his jeans) Sleep\u2019s been worse lately. Wake up at 5, drenched in sweat, and... (shrugs, voice dropping) Might as well be a broken machine. Doesn\u2019t matter how many times I try to fix it. (Avoids eye contact, focuses on a thread on his sleeve) You\u2019d think after six months I\u2019d get used to it, but... (long pause) The cracks just get bigger."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"6 months is a long time to experience this. Is this your first time seeking help?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I haven\u2019t talked to anyone about it before. (Fidgets with a loose thread on his sleeve, avoiding eye contact) My dad always said therapy was for people who couldn\u2019t fix their own problems. (Voice drops) I guess I thought if I just... worked harder, built something solid enough, it\u2019d go away. But the cracks... they\u2019re everywhere now."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What do you mean by cracks? Can you give me some examples?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Like... the job site last month. (Tugs at his sleeve, knuckles whitening) I messed up the beam calculations. Whole crew had to redo the framing. My foreman said it was 'careless,' but I knew it was worse. I let everyone down. (Voice cracks, then hardens) And Maria... we used to hike every weekend. Now I cancel. She asks why I\u2019m always tired, but it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s like I\u2019m... (pauses, staring at his hands) I\u2019m a cracked foundation. Even if we patch it, the house won\u2019t hold. (Mumbles) She\u2019d be better off without me anyway."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Tell me more"}
{"role":"patient","content":"There\u2019s... the debt. (Fingers dig into jeans, voice barely audible) I\u2019ve been borrowing against my paychecks. Maria doesn\u2019t know. I told her it was \u2018tools\u2019 or \u2018rent.\u2019 But the numbers don\u2019t add up. I\u2019m digging a hole, and every paycheck just... (shrugs) Makes the walls closer. (Stares at hands, knuckles red from gripping fabric) My brother... he\u2019s good at this. Always was. Runs his own crew now. I... I just keep breaking things. (Swallow hard) Last week, I snapped at Maria. Called her \u2018fragile\u2019 because she wanted me to come to her sister\u2019s wedding. (Voice cracks) She said she understood. But she doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m a cracked pipe. The more pressure, the more it leaks. (Pauses, pulls at sleeve thread) I don\u2019t know why she stays. Maybe... (shrugs) Maybe she\u2019s waiting for the flood."}
