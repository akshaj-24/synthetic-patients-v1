{"role":"patient","content":"Leah Hamilton. I... I\u2019m a doctor. Family medicine."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hows the weather?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Ugh. Rain again. The construction outside is relentless. I can\u2019t even focus on the weather when the site\u2019s hammering through my skull. It\u2019s... persistent, like my tiredness. You\u2019d think a break would help, but the fog just lingers."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What site"}
{"role":"patient","content":"The construction site outside my apartment. You know\u2014the one near the 5th street overpass. Demolishing a warehouse, I think. Non-stop since March. They start at 7 AM, but the jackhammers... it\u2019s like my brain\u2019s on a loop. Can\u2019t focus. Can\u2019t sleep. And when I do wake up, it\u2019s 3 AM, staring at the ceiling, replaying that stupid patient chart from last week. My father would\u2019ve called it 'overthinking.' Daniel says I need a vacation. But what\u2019s the point? I can\u2019t even remember why I moved here in the first place."}
