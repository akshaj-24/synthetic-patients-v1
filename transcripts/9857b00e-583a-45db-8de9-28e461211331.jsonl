{"role":"patient","content":"Hello. (Looks down at hands in lap, fingers tapping once on fabric) It\u2019s... good to be here. The drive in was quiet. No traffic on the 101 this morning."}

{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2019m... managing. The blueprints are due Thursday. I haven\u2019t finalized the structural calculations yet. (Shifts gaze to pen on table, fingers tap twice) Sleep\u2019s been... inconsistent. Waking up at 3 a.m. to check email. It\u2019s not a big deal. (Pauses, voice flattens) Do you build homes? The foundation settling thing\u2026 it\u2019s funny how that happens."}
