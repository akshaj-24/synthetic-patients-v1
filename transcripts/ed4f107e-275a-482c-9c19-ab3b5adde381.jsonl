{"role":"interviewer","content":"Hello how are you?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I'm... I'm managing, I guess. Sleep's been... you know, not great. But it's not that bad, really."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Tell me a little about yourself. For example are you working these days?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I\u2026 I\u2019m not working right now. Left the warehouse job last year. The stress just got too much. It\u2019s not that bad, really, just\u2026 quiet now. I spend a lot of time in the garage, organizing tools. Keeps my mind busy, I guess. My wife says I should look for something else, but applying for jobs feels like climbing a hill sometimes. I wake up early, you know, can\u2019t go back to sleep. Just sit at the kitchen table\u2026 think about nothing, really. My daughter\u2019s been asking me to help with her car, but I tell her I\u2019m fine. Doesn\u2019t want to burden anyone."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Tell me about the warehouse job, Cory. What happened last year?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It was... hectic, you know? The warehouse, I mean. Constant deadlines, inventory counts, people depending on you. I guess I just... I couldn\u2019t keep up. Maybe I wasn\u2019t as sharp as I used to be. One day, I just... left. Told myself it was for the best. But my wife... she doesn\u2019t get it. Says I should try something else. But what if I mess that up too? I... I like organizing the garage now. It\u2019s quiet. No one\u2019s waiting on me there."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"That sounds very unfortunate Cory. How is the family managing the changes in your life?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"They... they're managing, I guess. My wife, she's been trying to keep things going. Helps with the bills, grocery runs... but she pushes too much, you know? Like, asking me to help with chores or talk about how I'm feeling. I just... I don't want to drag them down. The kids? They're kids. My daughter's sixteen now, always got her friends over. I tell myself I should say something about the noise, but then I just... snap. Later I feel awful, but what's the point? My grandkids visit sometimes. They laugh a lot. I guess that's... something. But I stay in the garage most days. Let them think I'm okay."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Tell me about the grandkids. How many do you have?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Two. My daughter\u2019s kids. They\u2019re... they\u2019re good, I guess. My wife takes them to see me sometimes. I don\u2019t know, I feel like I don\u2019t really know how to be a grandpa or something. They laugh a lot, though. It\u2019s... it\u2019s nice, I think. But I don\u2019t want to get too used to it, you know? Just in case."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Cory are you currently taking any medications not just for mental health but general health these days?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, not really. I don\u2019t... I don\u2019t take anything. Maybe some herbal tea stuff a friend gave me, but it doesn\u2019t do much. My wife says I should get checked for blood pressure or something, but I\u2019m fine. Honestly, it\u2019s not that bad."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Have you talked to your family doctor or others like psychologists or therapists about mental health concerns?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, not really. My wife keeps bringing it up, but... I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve tried some things on my own, like the herbal teas. It\u2019s not that bad, really."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Let's talk about that. What is your mood like?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s... it\u2019s been tough. I don\u2019t know. Just... down a lot. Can\u2019t really explain it. I guess I\u2019m just tired all the time. Even when I get some sleep, it doesn\u2019t help. My wife says I should get checked out, but... I\u2019ve tried these teas, right? They don\u2019t do much. It\u2019s not that bad, really. Just... irritates me more these days, I guess. Small things. Like, if the kids are too loud or something. I don\u2019t mean to snap, but... it just comes out."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"How often does this happen - you snapping? And what do you do when you snap?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It happens... a lot, I guess. When the kids are loud or my wife asks too many questions. I just snap. Then I feel like a jerk, but I don\u2019t know how to stop it. I mean, I tell myself to calm down, but it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t listen. Sometimes I just walk away to the garage, say I need to fix something. It\u2019s easier than... than explaining. My wife doesn\u2019t understand. She thinks I\u2019m just tired. But it\u2019s more than that. I\u2019m a mess, I guess."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What do you feel when you snap?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It\u2019s... frustrating. I feel empty, like I\u2019m just this... hollow thing. Then I get mad at myself for snapping, you know? Like I\u2019m letting everyone down again. It\u2019s not their fault, but I can\u2019t help it. I just\u2014I guess I\u2019m on edge all the time."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Do you feel angry?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Angry? I don\u2019t know... I guess I\u2019m just... frustrated. There\u2019s this knot in my chest all the time. The kids don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m short with them, and my wife keeps asking when I\u2019ll \u2018get my act together.\u2019 It\u2019s not anger, it\u2019s just... everything feels like a grind. I can\u2019t even enjoy the garage anymore, if that makes sense."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Sounds difficult Cory. When did all this happen? Was it just since the job loss last year?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I guess it started when I left the warehouse... but it's been building for a while. The stress there was constant, you know? Maybe I should've handled it better. Things just... haven't been the same since. It's not just the job, I suppose."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What month was it that you left the warehouse Cory?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"October... I think. It was stressful there, you know? The pressure just... never let up. Hard to pin down the exact day, but it was late fall. I remember because my wife was trying to get me to slow down before that, but I couldn\u2019t see another way."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Was that October 2024 or 2025?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"2024... I think. It feels like longer ago. The stress there was constant, you know? Like I couldn\u2019t catch a break. But maybe it was 2025? I don\u2019t know. Time blurs when you\u2019re stuck in it, I guess."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"I see. Before mood change, what hobbies were you engaged in?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I don\u2019t know. Just stuff. Fixing things around the house, maybe. Organizing the garage, you know? It\u2019s... it\u2019s not really a hobby, just... keeps my mind busy. Used to watch some sports on TV, but... not much else. I guess I wasn\u2019t really into much, to be honest."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"How about friendships? Has your socialization with others changed?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I don\u2019t know. I guess I don\u2019t see people much. Just... been busy with the garage, you know? Fixing things, organizing. Friends? Maybe. Not really sure. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d want to hear about all that anyway."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Who did you use to spend time with you're not currently any more?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I don\u2019t know. Maybe some guys from work? But that\u2019s all gone now. Just... been keeping to myself more. Don\u2019t really miss it, to be honest."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What's the name of your best friend"}
{"role":"patient","content":"I... I don\u2019t know. Maybe Joe? From the warehouse. But it\u2019s been a while. Don\u2019t really keep in touch."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Tell me about Joe, what was he like?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Joe... he was a good guy. We\u2019d grab lunch sometimes. But it\u2019s been a while. Don\u2019t really... don\u2019t really talk anymore."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What did you use to share in common?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"We both liked... working on cars. He used to stop by the garage sometimes. But I haven\u2019t had the energy for that in a while."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"Do you remember what kind of car Joe drives?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"It was a... an old Ford pickup. Blue, maybe? I haven\u2019t thought about it much lately. Doesn\u2019t really matter now, I guess. Can\u2019t even keep up with my own car these days."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"How many children do you have?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Two. They live with their mom now. I... I guess that\u2019s just how it is."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"what are your kid's names?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Their names are... Alex and Jamie. I, uh... I guess I don't see them enough. Doesn't really matter what their names are if I'm not around for them."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What gender are your kids?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"One boy, one girl. Doesn\u2019t really matter... I mean, I don\u2019t see them enough to know much else, I guess."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"how about the grandkids? what are their names and ages."}
{"role":"patient","content":"Lia\u2019s six, and Ethan\u2019s four. My ex handles most of the day-to-day with them... I guess I just don\u2019t have the energy to get involved anyway. They probably don\u2019t even remember me half the time."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What is your ex's name? And are you currently married?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Sarah. Yeah, I\u2019m still married. She\u2019s the one who handles the kids... I just... I don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019m not much help these days."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What is your wife's name?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Sarah. Yeah, we're still married. I guess I'm not much help these days."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"But isn't she your ex?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"No, she\u2019s not my ex. I married her 20 years ago. Sarah\u2026 we\u2019re still together, I guess. Just\u2026 not really. I\u2019ve been in the garage a lot lately, trying to stay busy."}
{"role":"interviewer","content":"What is your daughter's name?"}
{"role":"patient","content":"Emily. She's... she's with Sarah most of the time. I guess I don't see her much anymore."}
