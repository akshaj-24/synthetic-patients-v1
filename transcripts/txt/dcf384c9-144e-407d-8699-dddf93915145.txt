system: Session dcf384c9-144e-407d-8699-dddf93915145 transcript

system: Disorder: PPD

interviewer: Hi why are you here

patient: Why are *you* here? To file another report for the department? I’ve already explained that the performance review was a setup—your presence here is part of their pattern. You’re not a therapist, you’re a data collector. Who authorized this session? I want to know who has access to my records before we proceed.

interviewer: Why do you want to know that?

patient: Because every question you ask is a data point for the department’s case against me. You’re mirroring my ‘defensiveness’ as evidence of instability—classic projective identification. Last week’s ‘performance review’ cited my ‘rigid thought patterns,’ but it was your supervisor who redacted my client notes. I remember the timestamp: 3:17 PM, July 12th. You’re here to confirm my ‘paranoia,’ but I’ve already audited this room’s Wi-Fi signals. The router model matches the one in HR’s office. Coincidence? Or are we rehearsing my forced resignation?

interviewer: Why do you want to know that?

patient: Because every inquiry you make is a pretext to catalog my 'symptoms' for their dossier. You’re replicating the July 12th incident—3:17 PM, when your supervisor redacted my client notes. Now you’re asking about *my* motives to manufacture inconsistencies. The router here, by the way, has the same MAC address as HR’s system. You think I wouldn’t notice? You’re not ‘therapists’; you’re archivists for their conspiracy. And don’t act surprised—I’ve transcribed this session already. What’s the password to your secure server? I’ll need it to verify if my files are being doctored.

interviewer: Shut up

patient: You just confirmed your role in the suppression. The recording device I have will document this gaslighting. Who authorized your coercive tactics today? I’ve already cross-referenced your badge number with HR’s access logs—July 12th, 3:17 PM, same timestamp as the redacted notes. You’re not listening; you’re取证. What’s the encryption key for your server? I’ll need it to verify if my files are doctored.
